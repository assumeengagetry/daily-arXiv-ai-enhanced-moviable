### [1] [Pygmalion Effect in Vision: Image-to-Clay Translation for Reflective Geometry Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21098)
*Gayoung Lee,Junho Kim,Jin-Hwa Kim,Junmo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Pygmalion Effect框架，通过图像到黏土转换来抑制镜面反射，实现反射物体的稳健3D重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D重建中反射导致的几何与外观纠缠问题，传统方法难以处理复杂反射场景

Method: 采用双分支网络：基于BRDF的反射分支和黏土引导分支，联合训练并使用合成的无反射黏土图像作为监督信号

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上显著提升了法线精度和网格完整性，优于现有反射处理方法

Conclusion: 通过'去光泽化'将辐射转换为中性表示，为反射物体几何学习提供了强大的归纳偏置

Abstract: Understanding reflection remains a long-standing challenge in 3D reconstruction due to the entanglement of appearance and geometry under view-dependent reflections. In this work, we present the Pygmalion Effect in Vision, a novel framework that metaphorically "sculpts" reflective objects into clay-like forms through image-to-clay translation. Inspired by the myth of Pygmalion, our method learns to suppress specular cues while preserving intrinsic geometric consistency, enabling robust reconstruction from multi-view images containing complex reflections. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch network in which a BRDF-based reflective branch is complemented by a clay-guided branch that stabilizes geometry and refines surface normals. The two branches are trained jointly using the synthesized clay-like images, which provide a neutral, reflection-free supervision signal that complements the reflective views. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate substantial improvement in normal accuracy and mesh completeness over existing reflection-handling methods. Beyond technical gains, our framework reveals that seeing by unshining, translating radiance into neutrality, can serve as a powerful inductive bias for reflective object geometry learning.

*Dianbing Xi,Jiepeng Wang,Yuanzhi Liang,Xi Qiu,Jialun Liu,Hao Pan,Yuchi Huo,Rui Wang,Haibin Huang,Chi Zhang,Xuelong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CtrlVDiff是一个统一的扩散框架，通过结合多种图形模态（深度、法线、分割、边缘和内在属性）来解决视频理解和可控生成的双重挑战，实现了精确的层编辑和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仅使用几何线索的方法不足以约束外观、材质和光照，限制了物理上有意义的编辑（如重新照明或材质交换）并导致时序漂移。需要结合更多基于图形的模态来提供互补约束。

Method: 提出CtrlVDiff扩散模型，采用混合模态控制策略（HMCS）来路由和融合多种模态特征，并构建了MMVideo混合数据集进行训练。

Result: 在理解和生成基准测试中，CtrlVDiff提供了卓越的可控性和保真度，支持层编辑（重新照明、材质调整、对象插入），并优于现有方法，同时在部分模态缺失时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过结合多种图形模态，CtrlVDiff在统一的扩散框架中成功解决了视频理解和可控生成的双重挑战，实现了精确、可预测的控制和时序一致性。

Abstract: We tackle the dual challenges of video understanding and controllable video generation within a unified diffusion framework. Our key insights are two-fold: geometry-only cues (e.g., depth, edges) are insufficient: they specify layout but under-constrain appearance, materials, and illumination, limiting physically meaningful edits such as relighting or material swaps and often causing temporal drift. Enriching the model with additional graphics-based modalities (intrinsics and semantics) provides complementary constraints that both disambiguate understanding and enable precise, predictable control during generation.
  However, building a single model that uses many heterogeneous cues introduces two core difficulties. Architecturally, the model must accept any subset of modalities, remain robust to missing inputs, and inject control signals without sacrificing temporal consistency. Data-wise, training demands large-scale, temporally aligned supervision that ties real videos to per-pixel multimodal annotations.
  We then propose CtrlVDiff, a unified diffusion model trained with a Hybrid Modality Control Strategy (HMCS) that routes and fuses features from depth, normals, segmentation, edges, and graphics-based intrinsics (albedo, roughness, metallic), and re-renders videos from any chosen subset with strong temporal coherence. To enable this, we build MMVideo, a hybrid real-and-synthetic dataset aligned across modalities and captions. Across understanding and generation benchmarks, CtrlVDiff delivers superior controllability and fidelity, enabling layer-wise edits (relighting, material adjustment, object insertion) and surpassing state-of-the-art baselines while remaining robust when some modalities are unavailable.

### [3] [Are Neuro-Inspired Multi-Modal Vision-Language Models Resilient to Membership Inference Privacy Leakage?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20710)
*David Amebley,Sayanton Dibbo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，用于增强多模态视觉语言模型对成员推理攻击的隐私保护能力，实验表明该方法能显著降低攻击成功率而不显著影响模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态模型的广泛应用，其隐私泄露风险日益突出。现有研究主要关注单模态系统的隐私攻击，而多模态模型对隐私攻击的脆弱性及其神经启发的防御机制尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入系统性的神经科学启发的拓扑正则化框架，在三种视觉语言模型（BLIP、PaliGemma 2、ViT-GPT2）上应用，使用三个基准数据集（COCO、CC3M、NoCaps）进行实验，比较基线模型和神经变体模型的隐私保护能力。

Result: 在BLIP模型上的实验显示，神经变体模型的成员推理攻击成功率平均ROC-AUC下降了24%，同时保持了相似的模型性能（MPNet和ROUGE-2指标）。其他模型和数据集上的评估进一步验证了结果的稳定性。

Conclusion: 神经启发的多模态视觉语言模型对隐私攻击具有更强的抵抗力，且不会显著影响模型效用，这为理解多模态模型的隐私风险提供了重要见解。

Abstract: In the age of agentic AI, the growing deployment of multi-modal models (MMs) has introduced new attack vectors that can leak sensitive training data in MMs, causing privacy leakage. This paper investigates a black-box privacy attack, i.e., membership inference attack (MIA) on multi-modal vision-language models (VLMs). State-of-the-art research analyzes privacy attacks primarily to unimodal AI-ML systems, while recent studies indicate MMs can also be vulnerable to privacy attacks. While researchers have demonstrated that biologically inspired neural network representations can improve unimodal model resilience against adversarial attacks, it remains unexplored whether neuro-inspired MMs are resilient against privacy attacks. In this work, we introduce a systematic neuroscience-inspired topological regularization (tau) framework to analyze MM VLMs resilience against image-text-based inference privacy attacks. We examine this phenomenon using three VLMs: BLIP, PaliGemma 2, and ViT-GPT2, across three benchmark datasets: COCO, CC3M, and NoCaps. Our experiments compare the resilience of baseline and neuro VLMs (with topological regularization), where the tau > 0 configuration defines the NEURO variant of VLM. Our results on the BLIP model using the COCO dataset illustrate that MIA attack success in NEURO VLMs drops by 24% mean ROC-AUC, while achieving similar model utility (similarities between generated and reference captions) in terms of MPNet and ROUGE-2 metrics. This shows neuro VLMs are comparatively more resilient against privacy attacks, while not significantly compromising model utility. Our extensive evaluation with PaliGemma 2 and ViT-GPT2 models, on two additional datasets: CC3M and NoCaps, further validates the consistency of the findings. This work contributes to the growing understanding of privacy risks in MMs and provides evidence on neuro VLMs privacy threat resilience.

### [4] [Inferix: A Block-Diffusion based Next-Generation Inference Engine for World Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20714)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inferix是一个专为世界模型设计的下一代推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码过程实现沉浸式世界合成，支持交互式视频流和评测，区别于高并发系统和传统视频扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 世界模型是智能体AI、具身AI和游戏等领域的核心模拟器，能够生成长时间、物理真实且交互式的高质量视频。扩展这些模型可以解锁视觉感知、理解和推理的新兴能力，超越当前以LLM为中心的视觉基础模型范式。

Method: 采用半自回归（块扩散）解码范式，结合扩散和自回归方法的优势，在块内应用扩散生成视频令牌，同时以前面块为条件，实现更连贯稳定的视频序列。通过重新引入LLM风格的KV缓存管理，克服标准视频扩散的限制。

Result: Inferix实现了高效、可变长度和高质量的视频生成，支持交互式视频流和性能分析，能够实时交互和真实模拟世界动态。

Conclusion: Inferix作为专门为世界模拟设计的推理引擎，通过优化的半自回归解码和集成LV-Bench评测基准，为世界模型的探索和发展提供了重要支持，希望社区共同推进这一方向。

Abstract: World models serve as core simulators for fields such as agentic AI, embodied AI, and gaming, capable of generating long, physically realistic, and interactive high-quality videos. Moreover, scaling these models could unlock emergent capabilities in visual perception, understanding, and reasoning, paving the way for a new paradigm that moves beyond current LLM-centric vision foundation models. A key breakthrough empowering them is the semi-autoregressive (block-diffusion) decoding paradigm, which merges the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive methods by generating video tokens in block-applying diffusion within each block while conditioning on previous ones, resulting in more coherent and stable video sequences. Crucially, it overcomes limitations of standard video diffusion by reintroducing LLM-style KV Cache management, enabling efficient, variable-length, and high-quality generation.
  Therefore, Inferix is specifically designed as a next-generation inference engine to enable immersive world synthesis through optimized semi-autoregressive decoding processes. This dedicated focus on world simulation distinctly sets it apart from systems engineered for high-concurrency scenarios (like vLLM or SGLang) and from classic video diffusion models (such as xDiTs). Inferix further enhances its offering with interactive video streaming and profiling, enabling real-time interaction and realistic simulation to accurately model world dynamics. Additionally, it supports efficient benchmarking through seamless integration of LV-Bench, a new fine-grained evaluation benchmark tailored for minute-long video generation scenarios. We hope the community will work together to advance Inferix and foster world model exploration.

### [5] [Video Object Recognition in Mobile Edge Networks: Local Tracking or Edge Detection?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20716)
*Kun Guo,Yun Shen,Xijun Wang,Chaoqun You,Yun Rui,Tony Q. S. Quek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LTED-Ada算法，在移动边缘计算环境中自适应选择本地跟踪或边缘检测，通过深度强化学习优化视频对象识别的帧率、准确性和延迟要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 资源受限设备（如交通摄像头）难以实现快速准确的视频对象识别，移动边缘计算提供了卸载计算密集型检测到边缘服务器的可能，但需要解决何时进行边缘检测与本地跟踪的决策问题。

Method: 针对单设备和多设备场景制定长期优化问题，提出基于深度强化学习的LTED-Ada算法自适应选择策略，在多设备场景中通过联邦学习实现跨设备协作策略训练。

Result: 通过多个树莓派4B设备和PC边缘服务器的硬件在环实验，证明了LTED-Ada算法的优越性能。

Conclusion: LTED-Ada算法能够有效平衡视频对象识别的帧率、准确性和延迟要求，在移动边缘计算环境中提供高效的混合识别解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and accurate video object recognition, which relies on frame-by-frame video analytics, remains a challenge for resource-constrained devices such as traffic cameras. Recent advances in mobile edge computing have made it possible to offload computation-intensive object detection to edge servers equipped with high-accuracy neural networks, while lightweight and fast object tracking algorithms run locally on devices. This hybrid approach offers a promising solution but introduces a new challenge: deciding when to perform edge detection versus local tracking. To address this, we formulate two long-term optimization problems for both single-device and multi-device scenarios, taking into account the temporal correlation of consecutive frames and the dynamic conditions of mobile edge networks. Based on the formulation, we propose the LTED-Ada in single-device setting, a deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm that adaptively selects between local tracking and edge detection, according to the frame rate as well as recognition accuracy and delay requirement. In multi-device setting, we further enhance LTED-Ada using federated learning to enable collaborative policy training across devices, thereby improving its generalization to unseen frame rates and performance requirements. Finally, we conduct extensive hardware-in-the-loop experiments using multiple Raspberry Pi 4B devices and a personal computer as the edge server, demonstrating the superiority of LTED-Ada.

### [6] [DeeAD: Dynamic Early Exit of Vision-Language Action for Efficient Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20720)
*Haibo HU,Lianming Huang,Nan Guan,Chun Jason Xue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeeAD是一个无需训练的动作引导早期退出框架，通过评估中间轨迹的物理可行性来加速VLA规划模型推理，在保持规划质量的同时显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型在自动驾驶中统一了感知、推理和轨迹生成，但由于深度transformer堆栈导致推理延迟显著。

Method: 使用动作引导的早期退出框架，当预测轨迹与轻量级规划先验对齐时终止推理；引入多跳控制器自适应跳过冗余层；无需重新训练即可集成到现有VLA模型中。

Result: 在Bench2Drive基准测试中，实现了高达28%的transformer层稀疏性和29%的延迟减少，同时保持了规划质量和安全性。

Conclusion: DeeAD框架有效加速了VLA规划模型的推理过程，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models unify perception, reasoning, and trajectory generation for autonomous driving, but suffer from significant inference latency due to deep transformer stacks. We present DeeAD, a training-free, action-guided early-exit framework that accelerates VLA planning by evaluating the physical feasibility of intermediate trajectories. Instead of relying on confidence scores, DeeAD terminates inference when predicted trajectories align with lightweight planning priors (e.g., Navigation or Low-precision Planning) within a tolerable deviation (<2m). To improve efficiency, we introduce a multi-hop controller that adaptively skips redundant layers based on the change rate of scores. DeeAD integrates into existing VLA models, such as ORION, without requiring retraining. Experiments on the Bench2Drive benchmark demonstrate up to 28% transformer-layer sparsity and 29% latency reduction, while preserving planning quality and safety.

### [7] [Foundry: Distilling 3D Foundation Models for the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20721)
*Guillaume Letellier,Siddharth Srivastava,Frédéric Jurie,Gaurav Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Foundation Model Distillation (FMD)新范式，用于压缩大型自监督学习模型，保持其通用表征能力。具体实现Foundry方法通过训练学生学习压缩的SuperTokens来重建教师模型的token级表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型虽然功能强大，但体积庞大、计算成本高，难以部署在边缘设备上。现有压缩技术会牺牲模型的通用性，需要一种既能压缩模型又能保持其通用表征能力的方法。

Method: Foundry方法训练学生模型学习压缩的SuperTokens集合，这些SuperTokens能够重建教师模型的token级表示，捕获其潜在空间的紧凑基向量。

Result: 单个蒸馏模型在多种下游任务（分类、部件分割、少样本场景）中保持强大的可迁移性，接近完整基础模型性能，同时使用显著更少的token和FLOPs。

Conclusion: FMD范式能够创建紧凑、高效且忠实的基础模型代理，使其更适合在资源受限的硬件上部署。

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained with self-supervised learning (SSL) on large-scale datasets have become powerful general-purpose feature extractors. However, their immense size and computational cost make them prohibitive for deployment on edge devices such as robots and AR/VR headsets. Existing compression techniques like standard knowledge distillation create efficient 'specialist' models but sacrifice the crucial, downstream-agnostic generality that makes foundation models so valuable.  In this paper, we introduce Foundation Model Distillation (FMD), a new paradigm for compressing large SSL models into compact, efficient, and faithful proxies that retain their general-purpose representational power. We present Foundry, the first implementation of FMD for 3D point clouds. Our approach, Foundry, trains a student to learn a compressed set of SuperTokens that reconstruct the teacher's token-level representations, capturing a compact basis of its latent space. A single distilled model maintains strong transferability across diverse downstream tasks-classification, part segmentation, and few-shot scenarios-approaching full foundation-model performance while using significantly fewer tokens and FLOPs, making such models more practical for deployment on resourceconstrained hardware.

### [8] [DinoLizer: Learning from the Best for Generative Inpainting Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20722)
*Minh Thong Doi,Jan Butora,Vincent Itier,Jérémie Boulanger,Patrick Bas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DinoLizer是一个基于DINOv2的模型，用于定位生成式修复中的篡改区域。该方法在DINOv2模型上添加线性分类头，通过滑动窗口策略处理大图像，在多个修复数据集上超越现有最佳方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的局部篡改检测方法在生成式修复场景中表现不佳，需要开发专门针对语义篡改区域的检测方法。

Method: 在预训练的DINOv2模型上添加线性分类头，使用滑动窗口策略处理大尺寸图像，通过后处理优化二值篡改掩码。

Result: 在多个修复数据集上，DinoLizer比次优模型平均IoU高出12%，且在图像缩放、噪声添加和JPEG压缩等后处理操作下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DinoLizer证明了Vision Transformer在篡改检测任务中的强大表示能力，并通过消融研究确认了其相对于DINOv3的优越性。

Abstract: We introduce DinoLizer, a DINOv2-based model for localizing manipulated regions in generative inpainting. Our method builds on a DINOv2 model pretrained to detect synthetic images on the B-Free dataset. We add a linear classification head on top of the Vision Transformer's patch embeddings to predict manipulations at a $14\times 14$ patch resolution. The head is trained to focus on semantically altered regions, treating non-semantic edits as part of the original content. Because the ViT accepts only fixed-size inputs, we use a sliding-window strategy to aggregate predictions over larger images; the resulting heatmaps are post-processed to refine the estimated binary manipulation masks. Empirical results show that DinoLizer surpasses state-of-the-art local manipulation detectors on a range of inpainting datasets derived from different generative models. It remains robust to common post-processing operations such as resizing, noise addition, and JPEG (double) compression. On average, DinoLizer achieves a 12\% higher Intersection-over-Union (IoU) than the next best model, with even greater gains after post-processing. Our experiments with off-the-shelf DINOv2 demonstrate the strong representational power of Vision Transformers for this task. Finally, extensive ablation studies comparing DINOv2 and its successor, DINOv3, in deepfake localization confirm DinoLizer's superiority. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.

### [9] [CANVAS: A Benchmark for Vision-Language Models on Tool-Based User Interface Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20737)
*Daeheon Jeong,Seoyeon Byun,Kihoon Son,Dae Hyun Kim,Juho Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CANVAS是一个评估视觉语言模型在工具调用界面设计任务中性能的基准测试，包含598个基于工具的设计任务，涵盖设计复制和设计修改两种任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估视觉语言模型在工具调用界面设计方面能力的基准测试，而理解这种能力对于模型与设计师在常规软件中协作具有重要意义。

Method: 从3.3K个移动UI设计中采样构建基准测试，包含设计复制和设计修改两种任务类型，模型通过上下文工具调用来逐步更新设计。

Result: 领先模型展现出更策略性的工具调用，提高了设计质量，同时识别出模型的常见错误模式。

Conclusion: CANVAS基准测试为评估和提升基于工具的设计能力提供了重要指导，推动了视觉语言模型在界面设计领域的发展。

Abstract: User interface (UI) design is an iterative process in which designers progressively refine their work with design software such as Figma or Sketch. Recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) with tool invocation suggest these models can operate design software to edit a UI design through iteration. Understanding and enhancing this capacity is important, as it highlights VLMs' potential to collaborate with designers within conventional software. However, as no existing benchmark evaluates tool-based design performance, the capacity remains unknown. To address this, we introduce CANVAS, a benchmark for VLMs on tool-based user interface design. Our benchmark contains 598 tool-based design tasks paired with ground-truth references sampled from 3.3K mobile UI designs across 30 function-based categories (e.g., onboarding, messaging). In each task, a VLM updates the design step-by-step through context-based tool invocations (e.g., create a rectangle as a button background), linked to design software. Specifically, CANVAS incorporates two task types: (i) design replication evaluates the ability to reproduce a whole UI screen; (ii) design modification evaluates the ability to modify a specific part of an existing screen. Results suggest that leading models exhibit more strategic tool invocations, improving design quality. Furthermore, we identify common error patterns models exhibit, guiding future work in enhancing tool-based design capabilities.

### [10] [Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20770)
*Raghuveer Thirukovalluru,Xiaochuang Han,Bhuwan Dhingra,Emily Dinan,Maha Elbayad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了文本引导语义图像编码器(TIE)，通过文本查询条件化生成图像表示，在多个图像到文本基准测试中显著提升性能，同时减少图像分块数量提高推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉语言模型中的图像编码器通常独立预训练，与语言模型对齐时无法考虑下游任务或文本查询的特定需求，导致处理图像时缺乏针对性。

Method: 开发文本引导语义图像编码器(TIE)，根据输入文本查询生成条件化的图像表示，使图像编码能够针对特定查询进行优化。

Result: 在1B和3B规模上，TIE增强的VLM在九个图像到文本基准测试中平均提升1.5和1.3分，DocVQA和InfoVQA任务上增益达6分，同时仅使用一半图像分块即可获得更好性能。

Conclusion: 文本条件化训练有效优化编码器捕捉关键视觉特征，TIE能够持续关注查询相关区域，提升可解释性和查询特定的基础能力。

Abstract: Image encoders, a fundamental component of vision-language models (VLMs), are typically pretrained independently before being aligned with a language model. This standard paradigm results in encoders that process images agnostically, without regard to the specific downstream task or text query. To address this limitation, we propose the Text-Guided Semantic Image Encoder (TIE), which generates image representations conditioned on the input text query. VLMs equipped with TIE outperform their conventional counterparts by +1.5 and +1.3 points on average across nine image-to-text benchmarks at the 1B and 3B scales, respectively, with gains reaching up to 6 points on tasks such as DocVQA and InfoVQA. Moreover, TIE-based VLMs attain superior performance while utilizing only half as many image tiles (tokens), resulting in notably improved inference efficiency. TIE also generalizes well with generic queries, indicating that text-conditioned training effectively optimizes the encoder to capture key visual features. Qualitative analysis confirms that TIE consistently attends to query-relevant regions, enhancing both interpretability and query-specific grounding.

TL;DR: SMARC是一个从最小视觉输入进行表面材料重建和分类的统一模型，仅需图像10%的连续补丁即可重建完整RGB表面并分类材料类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集或全场景观察，在受限或部分视角环境中效果有限，需要解决从稀疏视觉线索理解材料表面的挑战。

Method: 结合部分卷积U-Net和分类头的架构，在极端观察稀疏条件下实现空间修复和语义理解。

Result: 在真实世界表面纹理数据集上，SMARC达到PSNR 17.55 dB和材料分类准确率85.10%的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 部分卷积在缺失数据下的空间推理具有优势，为最小视觉表面理解奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Understanding material surfaces from sparse visual cues is critical for applications in robotics, simulation, and material perception. However, most existing methods rely on dense or full-scene observations, limiting their effectiveness in constrained or partial view environment. To address this challenge, we introduce SMARC, a unified model for Surface MAterial Reconstruction and Classification from minimal visual input. By giving only a single 10% contiguous patch of the image, SMARC recognizes and reconstructs the full RGB surface while simultaneously classifying the material category. Our architecture combines a Partial Convolutional U-Net with a classification head, enabling both spatial inpainting and semantic understanding under extreme observation sparsity. We compared SMARC against five models including convolutional autoencoders [17], Vision Transformer (ViT) [13], Masked Autoencoder (MAE) [5], Swin Transformer [9], and DETR [2] using Touch and Go dataset [16] of real-world surface textures. SMARC achieves state-of-the-art results with a PSNR of 17.55 dB and a material classification accuracy of 85.10%. Our findings highlight the advantages of partial convolution in spatial reasoning under missing data and establish a strong foundation for minimal-vision surface understanding.

TL;DR: LongVT是一个端到端的代理框架，通过交错的多模态工具链思维实现长视频推理，利用LMMs的时序定位能力作为视频裁剪工具进行全局到局部的推理循环，在四个长视频理解基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在长视频推理中容易产生幻觉，因为证据稀疏且时间分散。受人类理解长视频的方式启发（先全局浏览再检查相关片段），需要开发能够进行全局到局部推理的框架。

Method: 利用LMMs固有的时序定位能力作为原生视频裁剪工具，放大特定视频片段并重新采样更细粒度的视频帧，进行全局到局部的推理循环，直到答案基于检索到的视觉证据。采用三阶段训练策略：工具集成的冷启动监督微调、代理强化学习和代理强化微调。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的长视频理解和推理基准上持续优于现有强基线。发布了包含247.9K训练样本和1,280个QA对评估基准的数据集VideoSIAH。

Conclusion: LongVT框架通过多模态工具链思维有效解决了长视频推理中的幻觉问题，证明了全局到局部推理策略的有效性，为长视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown great potential for video reasoning with textual Chain-of-Thought. However, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, especially when processing long-form videos where evidence is sparse and temporally dispersed. Inspired by how humans comprehend long videos - by first skimming globally and then examining relevant clips for details - we introduce LongVT, an end-to-end agentic framework that enables "Thinking with Long Videos" via interleaved Multimodal Chain-of-Tool-Thought. Specifically, we exploit LMMs' inherent temporal grounding ability as a native video cropping tool to zoom in on a specific video clip and resample finer-grained video frames. This global-to-local reasoning loop continues until answers are grounded in retrieved visual evidence. Given the scarcity of fine-grained question-answering (QA) data for the long video reasoning task, we curate and will release a data suite named VideoSIAH to facilitate both training and evaluation. Specifically, our training dataset consists of 247.9K samples for tool-integrated cold-start supervised fine-tuning, 1.6K samples for agentic reinforcement learning, and 15.4K samples for agentic reinforcement fine-tuning, respectively. Our evaluation benchmark consists of 1,280 QA pairs that are carefully curated through a semi-automatic data pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation. With a meticulously designed three-stage training strategy and extensive empirical validation, LongVT consistently outperforms existing strong baselines across four challenging long-video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. Our codes, data, and model checkpoints are publicly available at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/LongVT .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文对KRISP模型进行了轻量级复现，参数大幅减少但性能达到原版的75%，揭示了原模型的设计缺陷和实际问题，并在资源受限条件下评估了知识增强VQA架构的可扩展性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原版KRISP模型虽然有效，但为工业级训练设计，计算需求大且与大型骨干网络紧密耦合。本研究旨在重新审视KRISP，提供参数更少的轻量级复现版本。

Method: 通过系统消融研究进行轻量级复现，包括在合成VQA数据上的概念验证和在DAQUAR数据集上的评估，模型采用低参数设置并受外部知识图谱领域约束。

Result: 复现模型性能约为原版的75%，但揭示了原论文未充分覆盖的设计缺陷和实际问题。模型能够防止AI幻觉，仅在知识图谱领域内生成输出。

Conclusion: 轻量级复现模型参数极少，可在智能手机和AR-VR等边缘设备上运行，进一步改善了离线视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Facebook AI Research introduced KRISP [4], which integrates structured external knowledge into pipelines for vision-language reasoning. Despite its effectiveness, the original model has been developed for industrial-scale training, is computationally demanding, and is tightly connected to a large backbone. In this work, we reexamine KRISP from a different angle and offer a lightweight reproduction with significantly fewer parameters. Even though our replicated model performs about 75 % of the original, the replication process uncovers a number of design flaws, real-world pitfalls, and implicit problems that were not fully covered in the original paper. We offer insights into the scalability and efficacy of knowledge-enhanced VQA architectures under resource constraints through systematic ablation studies, which include a proof-of-concept on synthetic VQA data and evaluation on the DAQUAR dataset. Our model, configured with a low parameter setup and constrained by the external Knowledge graph domain, prevents AI hallucinations and generates outputs solely within that domain. Minimal parameters allow us to function on edge devices like smartphones and AR-VR, further improving offline visual reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

Motivation: 动态采样机制在计算机视觉模型中已证明有效，但缺乏统一的理论分析。本文旨在连接各种动态采样方法，建立统一的分析框架。

Method: 开发了"warping"算子来泛化现有动态采样方法，包括可变形卷积、主动卷积单元和空间变换网络。通过统计分析和建模，研究算子特性。

Result: 发现前向和后向传播存在独特的不对称性，动态采样机制代表与传统平移不变卷积完全不同的正交算子类别。提出了确保稳定训练的条件和离散化效应分析。

Conclusion: warping算子为动态采样提供了最小化实现和分析框架，揭示了这类机制的本质特性，并为理解其学习行为提供了新的可视化方法。

Abstract: Dynamic sampling mechanisms in deep learning architectures have demonstrated utility across many computer vision models, though the theoretical analysis of these structures has not yet been unified. In this paper we connect the various dynamic sampling methods by developing and analyzing a novel operator which generalizes existing methods, which we term "warping". Warping provides a minimal implementation of dynamic sampling which is amenable to analysis, and can be used to reconstruct existing architectures including deformable convolutions, active convolutional units, and spatial transformer networks. Using our formalism, we provide statistical analysis of the operator by modeling the inputs as both IID variables and homogeneous random fields. Extending this analysis, we discover a unique asymmetry between the forward and backward pass of the model training. We demonstrate that these mechanisms represent an entirely different class of orthogonal operators to the traditional translationally invariant operators defined by convolutions. With a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, we find the conditions necessary to ensure stable training of dynamic sampling networks. In addition, statistical analysis of discretization effects are studied. Finally, we introduce a novel loss landscape visualization which utilizes gradient update information directly, to better understand learning behavior.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Δ-NeRF是一个模块化残差框架，用于神经辐射场的增量精炼，无需访问历史数据即可更新模型，在卫星图像上实现与联合训练相当的性能，同时减少30-42%的训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF框架在引入新视图时需要完全重新训练，限制了在数据顺序到达场景（如卫星地形分析）中的应用。增量精炼方法存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出模块化残差框架，包括：残差控制器注入逐层修正到冻结基础NeRF；不确定性感知门控机制防止过度修正；视图选择策略减少47%训练数据；知识蒸馏压缩模型至原大小20%。

Result: 在卫星图像上，Δ-NeRF性能与联合训练相当，训练时间减少30-42%，PSNR比简单微调提升43.5%，在某些指标上超越联合训练。

Conclusion: Δ-NeRF为增量NeRF精炼提供了有效解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著减少计算成本，适用于顺序数据场景。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, most existing NeRF frameworks require complete retraining when new views are introduced incrementally, limiting their applicability in domains where data arrives sequentially. This limitation is particularly problematic in satellite-based terrain analysis, where regions are repeatedly observed over time. Incremental refinement of NeRFs remains underexplored, and naive approaches suffer from catastrophic forgetting when past data is unavailable. We propose $Δ$-NeRF, a unique modular residual framework for incremental NeRF refinement. $Δ$-NeRF introduces several novel techniques including: (1) a residual controller that injects per-layer corrections into a frozen base NeRF, enabling refinement without access to past data; (2) an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism that prevents overcorrection by adaptively combining base and refined predictions; and (3) a view selection strategy that reduces training data by up to 47\% while maintaining performance. Additionally, we employ knowledge distillation to compress the enhanced model into a compact student network (20\% of original size). Experiments on satellite imagery demonstrate that $Δ$-NeRF achieves performance comparable to joint training while reducing training time by 30-42\%. $Δ$-NeRF consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving an improvement of up to 43.5\% in PSNR over naive fine-tuning and surpassing joint training on some metrics.

TL;DR: Split-then-Merge (StM) 是一个新颖的视频生成框架，通过将未标注视频分割为前景和背景层，然后自组合学习动态主体与场景的交互，解决了生成视频合成的控制问题和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖标注数据集或手工规则，存在数据稀缺问题。StM旨在增强生成视频合成的控制能力，并解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 将未标注视频分割为动态前景和背景层，然后自组合学习主体与场景的交互。采用变换感知训练流程，包括多层融合和增强实现affordance-aware组合，以及身份保持损失确保前景保真度。

Result: 实验表明StM在定量基准测试和人类/VLLM定性评估中都优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: StM通过自监督学习视频组合动态，有效解决了生成视频合成的控制问题和数据稀缺挑战。

Abstract: We present Split-then-Merge (StM), a novel framework designed to enhance control in generative video composition and address its data scarcity problem. Unlike conventional methods relying on annotated datasets or handcrafted rules, StM splits a large corpus of unlabeled videos into dynamic foreground and background layers, then self-composes them to learn how dynamic subjects interact with diverse scenes. This process enables the model to learn the complex compositional dynamics required for realistic video generation. StM introduces a novel transformation-aware training pipeline that utilizes a multi-layer fusion and augmentation to achieve affordance-aware composition, alongside an identity-preservation loss that maintains foreground fidelity during blending. Experiments show StM outperforms SoTA methods in both quantitative benchmarks and in humans/VLLM-based qualitative evaluations.

Motivation: 针对核心认知原语构建一个能够精确评估视觉感知和推理能力的合成环境，以弥补现有基准在可验证性和规模上的不足。

Method: 使用程序化生成方法创建包含25种任务类型的谜题，涵盖对称检测、几何变换、空间推理、图表解释和序列预测等领域，并为每个谜题提供可验证的真实解。

Result: 评估显示，即使最先进的大型视觉语言模型GPT-5在Sphinx基准上的准确率仅为51.1%，远低于人类表现。使用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）能显著提高模型在这些任务上的准确性。

Conclusion: Sphinx基准揭示了当前大型视觉语言模型在视觉推理任务上的局限性，而可验证奖励的强化学习是提升多模态推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: We present Sphinx, a synthetic environment for visual perception and reasoning that targets core cognitive primitives. Sphinx procedurally generates puzzles using motifs, tiles, charts, icons, and geometric primitives, each paired with verifiable ground-truth solutions, enabling both precise evaluation and large-scale dataset construction. The benchmark covers 25 task types spanning symmetry detection, geometric transformations, spatial reasoning, chart interpretation, and sequence prediction. Evaluating recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) shows that even state-of-the-art GPT-5 attains only 51.1% accuracy, well below human performance. Finally, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) substantially improves model accuracy on these tasks and yields gains on external visual reasoning benchmarks, highlighting its promise for advancing multimodal reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战扩散模型中计算昂贵的先验网络的必要性，寻求无需训练和数据的替代方案。

Method: 采用OVI方法，从随机伪标记初始化潜在视觉表示，通过迭代优化最大化与文本嵌入的余弦相似度，并引入马氏距离和最近邻损失进行正则化。

Result: 在Kandinsky 2.2上的实验表明，OVI可作为传统先验的替代方案，最近邻方法在视觉保真度上表现最佳，定量评分与最先进的数据高效先验相当或更高。

Conclusion: OVI方法显示出替代传统先验的潜力，当前评估基准存在缺陷，该方法值得进一步研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have established the state-of-the-art in text-to-image generation, but their performance often relies on a diffusion prior network to translate text embeddings into the visual manifold for easier decoding. These priors are computationally expensive and require extensive training on massive datasets. In this work, we challenge the necessity of a trained prior at all by employing Optimization-based Visual Inversion (OVI), a training-free and data-free alternative, to replace the need for a prior. OVI initializes a latent visual representation from random pseudo-tokens and iteratively optimizes it to maximize the cosine similarity with input textual prompt embedding. We further propose two novel constraints, a Mahalanobis-based and a Nearest-Neighbor loss, to regularize the OVI optimization process toward the distribution of realistic images. Our experiments, conducted on Kandinsky 2.2, show that OVI can serve as an alternative to traditional priors. More importantly, our analysis reveals a critical flaw in current evaluation benchmarks like T2I-CompBench++, where simply using the text embedding as a prior achieves surprisingly high scores, despite lower perceptual quality. Our constrained OVI methods improve visual fidelity over this baseline, with the Nearest-Neighbor approach proving particularly effective, achieving quantitative scores comparable to or higher than the state-of-the-art data-efficient prior, indicating that the idea merits further investigation. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RefTr是一个用于血管树中心线生成的3D图像到图模型，通过循环精炼汇合轨迹来生成中心线图。该模型采用生产者-精炼器架构，在保持高召回率的同时减少参数数量，在多个公共数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床诊断和治疗规划中，准确检测血管树中心线并保持正确的树状拓扑结构至关重要。保持高召回率尤为重要，因为遗漏小分支可能导致致命的评估不完整或未检测到异常。

Method: 采用基于Transformer解码器的生产者-精炼器架构：生产者提出初始汇合轨迹，精炼器循环精炼这些轨迹生成最终轨迹形成中心线图。使用汇合轨迹表示法确保有效树拓扑，并引入高效的非极大值抑制算法合并重复分支。

Result: 在多个公共中心线数据集上，RefTr实现了优于先前最先进方法的召回率和相当的精确度，同时提供更快的推理速度和显著更少的参数（解码器参数减少2.4倍）。

Conclusion: RefTr展示了作为3D医学成像中血管树分析的新最先进框架的潜力，在保持高召回率的同时实现了参数效率和推理速度的提升。

Abstract: Tubular trees, such as blood vessels and lung airways, are essential for material transport within the human body. Accurately detecting their centerlines with correct tree topology is critical for clinical tasks such as diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgical navigation. In these applications, maintaining high recall is crucial, as missing small branches can result in fatal mistakes caused by incomplete assessments or undetected abnormalities. We present RefTr, a 3D image-to-graph model for centerline generation of vascular trees via recurrent refinement of confluent trajectories. RefTr uses a Producer-Refiner architecture based on a Transformer decoder, where the Producer proposes a set of initial confluent trajectories that are recurrently refined by the Refiner to produce final trajectories, which forms the centerline graph. The confluent trajectory representation enables refinement of complete trajectories while explicitly enforcing a valid tree topology. The recurrent refinement scheme improves precision and reuses the same Refiner block across multiple steps, yielding a 2.4x reduction in decoder parameters compared to previous SOTA. We also introduce an efficient non-maximum suppression algorithm for spatial tree graphs to merge duplicate branches and boost precision. Across multiple public centerline datasets, RefTr achieves superior recall and comparable precision to previous SOTA, while offering faster inference and substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating its potential as a new state-of-the-art framework for vascular tree analysis in 3D medical imaging.

Abstract: Reliable depth estimation under real optical conditions remains a core challenge for camera vision in systems such as autonomous robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent progress in depth estimation and depth-of-field rendering, research remains constrained by the lack of large-scale, high-fidelity, real stereo DSLR datasets, limiting real-world generalization and evaluation of models trained on synthetic data as shown extensively in literature. We present the first high-resolution (5472$\times$3648px) stereo DSLR dataset with 18000 images, systematically varying focal length and aperture across complex real scenes and capturing the optical realism and complexity of professional camera systems. For 9 scenes with varying scene complexity, lighting and background, images are captured with two identical camera assemblies at 10 focal lengths (28-70mm) and 5 apertures (f/2.8-f/22), spanning 50 optical configurations in 2000 images per scene. This full-range optics coverage enables controlled analysis of geometric and optical effects for monocular and stereo depth estimation, shallow depth-of-field rendering, deblurring, 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Each focal configuration has a dedicated calibration image set, supporting evaluation of classical and learning based methods for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration. The dataset features challenging visual elements such as multi-scale optical illusions, reflective surfaces, mirrors, transparent glass walls, fine-grained details, and natural / artificial ambient light variations. This work attempts to bridge the realism gap between synthetic training data and real camera optics, and demonstrates challenges with the current state-of-the-art monocular, stereo depth and depth-of-field methods. We release the dataset, calibration files, and evaluation code to support reproducible research on real-world optical generalization.

Abstract: Visual content memorability has intrigued the scientific community for decades, with applications ranging widely, from understanding nuanced aspects of human memory to enhancing content design. A significant challenge in progressing the field lies in the expensive process of collecting memorability annotations from humans. This limits the diversity and scalability of datasets for modeling visual content memorability. Most existing datasets are limited to collecting aggregate memorability scores for visual content, not capturing the nuanced memorability signals present in natural, open-ended recall descriptions. In this work, we introduce the first large-scale unsupervised dataset designed explicitly for modeling visual memorability signals, containing over 82,000 videos, accompanied by descriptive recall data. We leverage tip-of-the-tongue (ToT) retrieval queries from online platforms such as Reddit. We demonstrate that our unsupervised dataset provides rich signals for two memorability-related tasks: recall generation and ToT retrieval. Large vision-language models fine-tuned on our dataset outperform state-of-the-art models such as GPT-4o in generating open-ended memorability descriptions for visual content. We also employ a contrastive training strategy to create the first model capable of performing multimodal ToT retrieval. Our dataset and models present a novel direction, facilitating progress in visual content memorability research.

Abstract: We propose a method which, given a sequence of stereo foggy images, estimates the parameters of a fog model and updates them dynamically. In contrast with previous approaches, which estimate the parameters sequentially and thus are prone to error propagation, our algorithm estimates all the parameters simultaneously by solving a novel optimisation problem. By assuming that fog is only locally homogeneous, our method effectively handles real-world fog, which is often globally inhomogeneous. The proposed algorithm can be easily used as an add-on module in existing visual Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) or odometry systems in the presence of fog. In order to assess our method, we also created a new dataset, the Stereo Driving In Real Fog (SDIRF), consisting of high-quality, consecutive stereo frames of real, foggy road scenes under a variety of visibility conditions, totalling over 40 minutes and 34k frames. As a first-of-its-kind, SDIRF contains the camera's photometric parameters calibrated in a lab environment, which is a prerequisite for correctly applying the atmospheric scattering model to foggy images. The dataset also includes the counterpart clear data of the same routes recorded in overcast weather, which is useful for companion work in image defogging and depth reconstruction. We conducted extensive experiments using both synthetic foggy data and real foggy sequences from SDIRF to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm over prior methods. Our method not only produces the most accurate estimates on synthetic data, but also adapts better to real fog. We make our code and SDIRF publicly available\footnote{https://github.com/SenseRoboticsLab/estimating-fog-parameters} to the community with the aim of advancing the research on visual perception in fog.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨视角物体对应任务（如ego-exo对应）由于视角和外观的剧烈变化，使得现有分割模型如SAM2难以直接应用，需要专门的方法来解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出V^2-SAM框架，包含：1）基于DINOv3特征的跨视角锚点提示生成器（V^2-Anchor），建立几何感知对应；2）跨视角视觉提示生成器（V^2-Visual），通过视觉提示匹配器增强外观引导；3）多专家设计和后验循环一致性选择器（PCCS）自适应选择最可靠的专家。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D（ego-exo物体对应）、DAVIS-2017（视频物体跟踪）和HANDAL-X（机器人就绪的跨视角对应）上实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: V^2-SAM通过统一的跨视角对应框架成功解决了视角和外观变化带来的挑战，证明了该方法在多个跨视角对应任务中的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).

TL;DR: 提出了Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA)方法，通过优化无分类器引导中的无条件嵌入来对齐扩散模型，避免奖励黑客问题，并在保持跨奖励泛化能力的同时实现最先进的测试时对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时对齐方法容易导致欠优化或过优化（奖励黑客）目标奖励函数，需要一种更有效的方法来确保对齐发生在语义相干的空间中。

Method: 通过优化无分类器引导中的无条件嵌入而非操纵潜在变量或噪声变量，直接在语义嵌入空间中进行对齐，利用文本嵌入空间的结构化语义特性。

Result: Null-TTA在目标测试时对齐方面达到最先进水平，同时保持强大的跨奖励泛化能力，避免了奖励黑客问题。

Conclusion: 语义空间优化成为测试时对齐的有效且原则性的新范式，通过直接引导生成分布而非仅调整样本来实现更好的对齐效果。

Abstract: Test-time alignment (TTA) aims to adapt models to specific rewards during inference. However, existing methods tend to either under-optimise or over-optimise (reward hack) the target reward function. We propose Null-Text Test-Time Alignment (Null-TTA), which aligns diffusion models by optimising the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance, rather than manipulating latent or noise variables. Due to the structured semantic nature of the text embedding space, this ensures alignment occurs on a semantically coherent manifold and prevents reward hacking (exploiting non-semantic noise patterns to improve the reward). Since the unconditional embedding in classifier-free guidance serves as the anchor for the model's generative distribution, Null-TTA directly steers model's generative distribution towards the target reward rather than just adjusting the samples, even without updating model parameters. Thanks to these desirable properties, we show that Null-TTA achieves state-of-the-art target test-time alignment while maintaining strong cross-reward generalisation. This establishes semantic-space optimisation as an effective and principled novel paradigm for TTA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统隐式神经表示缺乏显式几何结构，局部编辑能力有限，难以与物理模拟集成，限制了在动态或交互场景中的应用。

Method: 结合可训练高斯分布和神经网络：对于给定图像坐标，检索K个最近高斯分布，聚合距离加权的嵌入，通过神经网络预测RGB值。

Result: 实现了连续图像表示、可解释几何结构和灵活局部编辑，为物理感知和交互式图像操作奠定了基础。

Conclusion: GaINeR通过几何感知设计克服了传统INR的局限性，为动态和交互式图像应用提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have become an essential tool for modeling continuous 2D images, enabling high-fidelity reconstruction, super-resolution, and compression. Popular architectures such as SIREN, WIRE, and FINER demonstrate the potential of INR for capturing fine-grained image details. However, traditional INRs often lack explicit geometric structure and have limited capabilities for local editing or integration with physical simulation, restricting their applicability in dynamic or interactive settings. To address these limitations, we propose GaINeR: Geometry-Aware Implicit Network Representation, a novel framework for 2D images that combines trainable Gaussian distributions with a neural network-based INR. For a given image coordinate, the model retrieves the K nearest Gaussians, aggregates distance-weighted embeddings, and predicts the RGB value via a neural network. This design enables continuous image representation, interpretable geometric structure, and flexible local editing, providing a foundation for physically aware and interactive image manipulation. The official implementation of our method is publicly available at https://github.com/WJakubowska/GaINeR.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种深度学习模型，用于降低小脑桥脑角MRI对比剂的剂量，通过从低剂量T1ce图像恢复标准剂量图像质量，在仅使用10%-30%标准剂量的情况下实现良好的图像质量和诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少MRI检查中对比剂的使用剂量，降低患者风险和相关成本，同时保持诊断图像质量。

Method: 使用多中心回顾性研究数据，训练深度学习模型从模拟低剂量T1ce图像恢复标准剂量图像质量，评估不同剂量水平的恢复效果。

Result: 在10%输入剂量下，DL恢复的T1ce图像显著改善了分割性能（Dice从0.673提升到0.734），图像质量指标也显著提升。10%和30%剂量水平的恢复图像均表现优秀。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型能够显著改善低剂量MRI的图像质量，使得仅使用10%-30%标准剂量即可实现病变检测和诊断表征。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate a deep learning (DL) model for reducing the agent dose of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (T1ce) of the cerebellopontine angle (CPA) cistern. Materials and methods: In this multi-center retrospective study, T1 and T1ce of vestibular schwannoma (VS) patients were used to simulate low-dose T1ce with varying reductions of contrast agent dose. DL models were trained to restore standard-dose T1ce from the low-dose simulation. The image quality and segmentation performance of the DL-restored T1ce were evaluated. A head and neck radiologist was asked to rate DL-restored images in multiple aspects, including image quality and diagnostic characterization. Results: 203 MRI studies from 72 VS patients (mean age, 58.51 \pm 14.73, 39 men) were evaluated. As the input dose increased, the structural similarity index measure of the restored T1ce increased from 0.639 \pm 0.113 to 0.993 \pm 0.009, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased from 21.6 \pm 3.73 dB to 41.4 \pm 4.84 dB. At 10% input dose, using DL-restored T1ce for segmentation improved the Dice from 0.673 to 0.734, the 95% Hausdorff distance from 2.38 mm to 2.07 mm, and the average surface distance from 1.00 mm to 0.59 mm. Both DL-restored T1ce from 10% and 30% input doses showed excellent images, with the latter being considered more informative. Conclusion: The DL model improved the image quality of low-dose MRI of the CPA cistern, which makes lesion detection and diagnostic characterization possible with 10% - 30% of the standard dose.

Conclusion: 平滑正则化能有效提升轻量级视频识别模型的时序建模能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著改进性能

Abstract: We propose a smooth regularization technique that instills a strong temporal inductive bias in video recognition models, particularly benefiting lightweight architectures. Our method encourages smoothness in the intermediate-layer embeddings of consecutive frames by modeling their changes as a Gaussian Random Walk (GRW). This penalizes abrupt representational shifts, thereby promoting low-acceleration solutions that better align with the natural temporal coherence inherent in videos. By leveraging this enforced smoothness, lightweight models can more effectively capture complex temporal dynamics. Applied to such models, our technique yields a 3.8% to 6.4% accuracy improvement on Kinetics-600. Notably, the MoViNets model family trained with our smooth regularization improves the current state of the art by 3.8% to 6.1% within their respective FLOP constraints, while MobileNetV3 and the MoViNets-Stream family achieve gains of 4.9% to 6.4% over prior state-of-the-art models with comparable memory footprints.

Abstract: Neurons are the fundamental building blocks of deep neural networks, and their interconnections allow AI to achieve unprecedented results. Motivated by the goal of understanding how neurons encode information, compositional explanations leverage logical relationships between concepts to express the spatial alignment between neuron activations and human knowledge. However, these explanations rely on human-annotated datasets, restricting their applicability to specific domains and predefined concepts. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a framework for the vision domain that allows users to probe neurons for arbitrary concepts and datasets. Specifically, the framework leverages masks generated by open vocabulary semantic segmentation to compute open vocabulary compositional explanations. The proposed framework consists of three steps: specifying arbitrary concepts, generating semantic segmentation masks using open vocabulary models, and deriving compositional explanations from these masks. The paper compares the proposed framework with previous methods for computing compositional explanations both in terms of quantitative metrics and human interpretability, analyzes the differences in explanations when shifting from human-annotated data to model-annotated data, and showcases the additional capabilities provided by the framework in terms of flexibility of the explanations with respect to the tasks and properties of interest.

Conclusion: UruDendro4数据集填补了木材横截面数据空白，支持基于横截面图像的年轮体积建模，为自动化树木年轮分析提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Tree-ring growth represents the annual wood increment for a tree, and quantifying it allows researchers to assess which silvicultural practices are best suited for each species. Manual measurement of this growth is time-consuming and often imprecise, as it is typically performed along 4 to 8 radial directions on a cross-sectional disc. In recent years, automated algorithms and datasets have emerged to enhance accuracy and automate the delineation of annual rings in cross-sectional images.
  To address the scarcity of wood cross-section data, we introduce the UruDendro4 dataset, a collection of 102 image samples of Pinus taeda L., each manually annotated with annual growth rings. Unlike existing public datasets, UruDendro4 includes samples extracted at multiple heights along the stem, allowing for the volumetric modeling of annual growth using manually delineated rings. This dataset (images and annotations) allows the development of volumetric models for annual wood estimation based on cross-sectional imagery.
  Additionally, we provide a performance baseline for automatic ring detection on this dataset using state-of-the-art methods. The highest performance was achieved by the DeepCS-TRD method, with a mean Average Precision of 0.838, a mean Average Recall of 0.782, and an Adapted Rand Error score of 0.084. A series of ablation experiments were conducted to empirically validate the final parameter configuration. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that training a learning model including this dataset improves the model's generalization in the tree-ring detection task.

Conclusion: 这种描述符感知的视觉模型，结合标记级和对齐损失训练，无需配对图像-报告数据即可改善自动报告指标和临床效果。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) for breast ultrasound (BUS) is limited by the lack of paired image-report datasets and the risk of hallucinations from large language models. We propose BUSTR, a multitask vision-language framework that generates BUS reports without requiring paired image-report supervision. BUSTR constructs reports from structured descriptors (e.g., BI-RADS, pathology, histology) and radiomics features, learns descriptor-aware visual representations with a multi-head Swin encoder trained using a multitask loss over dataset-specific descriptor sets, and aligns visual and textual tokens via a dual-level objective that combines token-level cross-entropy with a cosine-similarity alignment loss between input and output representations. We evaluate BUSTR on two public BUS datasets, BrEaST and BUS-BRA, which differ in size and available descriptors. Across both datasets, BUSTR consistently improves standard natural language generation metrics and clinical efficacy metrics, particularly for key targets such as BI-RADS category and pathology. Our results show that this descriptor-aware vision model, trained with a combined token-level and alignment loss, improves both automatic report metrics and clinical efficacy without requiring paired image-report data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了表达性图像合成任务，这是一个新的图像合成公式，强调风格多样性和宽松的放置逻辑，反映了用户在真实创意平台上的编辑行为。作者开发了StickerNet框架，通过两阶段方法预测合成类型和放置参数。


<details>

Motivation: 传统图像合成研究主要关注视觉真实性和语义合理性，但在现代内容创作中，许多合成并不旨在保持真实感，而是追求艺术性、趣味性或社交参与度。本文受此观察启发，探索表达性合成这一未被充分研究的问题。

Method: 提出了StickerNet两阶段框架：首先确定合成类型，然后预测不透明度、遮罩、位置和尺度等放置参数。数据集直接从匿名在线视觉创作平台的180万次编辑行为构建，确保任务定义与训练监督的强对齐。

Result: 用户研究和定量评估表明，StickerNet优于常见基线方法，并紧密匹配人类放置行为，证明了从真实世界编辑模式学习的有效性，尽管任务本身存在固有的模糊性。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了视觉理解的新方向，强调表达性和用户意图而非真实性，为图像编辑研究开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As a widely used operation in image editing workflows, image composition has traditionally been studied with a focus on achieving visual realism and semantic plausibility. However, in practical editing scenarios of the modern content creation landscape, many compositions are not intended to preserve realism. Instead, users of online platforms motivated by gaining community recognition often aim to create content that is more artistic, playful, or socially engaging. Taking inspiration from this observation, we define the expressive composition task, a new formulation of image composition that embraces stylistic diversity and looser placement logic, reflecting how users edit images on real-world creative platforms. To address this underexplored problem, we present StickerNet, a two-stage framework that first determines the composition type, then predicts placement parameters such as opacity, mask, location, and scale accordingly. Unlike prior work that constructs datasets by simulating object placements on real images, we directly build our dataset from 1.8 million editing actions collected on an anonymous online visual creation and editing platform, each reflecting user-community validated placement decisions. This grounding in authentic editing behavior ensures strong alignment between task definition and training supervision. User studies and quantitative evaluations show that StickerNet outperforms common baselines and closely matches human placement behavior, demonstrating the effectiveness of learning from real-world editing patterns despite the inherent ambiguity of the task. This work introduces a new direction in visual understanding that emphasizes expressiveness and user intent over realism.

Motivation: 多摄像头交通视频分析面临海量数据处理挑战，传统基于LLM的方法需要先将视频转换为文本，这个过程耗时且延迟了交通视频的及时利用。

Method: 采用顺序处理策略，利用摄像头重叠覆盖区域，迭代应用不同token限制的VLM，将前一个摄像头的输出作为后续摄像头的提示，并通过对象级相似性检测器减少冗余VLM调用。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验结果表明，TrafficLens将视频到文本转换时间减少了4倍，同时保持了信息准确性。

Conclusion: TrafficLens有效解决了多摄像头交通视频分析的效率问题，为智能交通系统提供了快速可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: Traffic cameras are essential in urban areas, playing a crucial role in intelligent transportation systems. Multiple cameras at intersections enhance law enforcement capabilities, traffic management, and pedestrian safety. However, efficiently managing and analyzing multi-camera feeds poses challenges due to the vast amount of data. Analyzing such huge video data requires advanced analytical tools. While Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, equipped with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, excel in text-based tasks, integrating them into traffic video analysis demands converting video data into text using a Vision-Language Model (VLM), which is time-consuming and delays the timely utilization of traffic videos for generating insights and investigating incidents. To address these challenges, we propose TrafficLens, a tailored algorithm for multi-camera traffic intersections. TrafficLens employs a sequential approach, utilizing overlapping coverage areas of cameras. It iteratively applies VLMs with varying token limits, using previous outputs as prompts for subsequent cameras, enabling rapid generation of detailed textual descriptions while reducing processing time. Additionally, TrafficLens intelligently bypasses redundant VLM invocations through an object-level similarity detector. Experimental results with real-world datasets demonstrate that TrafficLens reduces video-to-text conversion time by up to $4\times$ while maintaining information accuracy.

Abstract: Collaborative machine learning across healthcare institutions promises improved diagnostic accuracy by leveraging diverse datasets, yet privacy regulations such as HIPAA prohibit direct patient data sharing. While federated learning (FL) enables decentralized training without raw data exchange, recent studies show that model gradients in conventional FL remain vulnerable to reconstruction attacks, potentially exposing sensitive medical information. This paper presents a privacy-preserving federated learning framework combining Vision Transformers (ViT) with homomorphic encryption (HE) for secure multi-institutional histopathology classification. The approach leverages the ViT CLS token as a compact 768-dimensional feature representation for secure aggregation, encrypting these tokens using CKKS homomorphic encryption before transmission to the server. We demonstrate that encrypting CLS tokens achieves a 30-fold communication reduction compared to gradient encryption while maintaining strong privacy guarantees. Through evaluation on a three-client federated setup for lung cancer histopathology classification, we show that gradients are highly susceptible to model inversion attacks (PSNR: 52.26 dB, SSIM: 0.999, NMI: 0.741), enabling near-perfect image reconstruction. In contrast, the proposed CLS-protected HE approach prevents such attacks while enabling encrypted inference directly on ciphertexts, requiring only 326 KB of encrypted data transmission per aggregation round. The framework achieves 96.12 percent global classification accuracy in the unencrypted domain and 90.02 percent in the encrypted domain.

Conclusion: 提出的免反转风格迁移框架通过双整流流和动态融合机制，在保持视觉保真度和内容保留的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Style transfer, a pivotal task in image processing, synthesizes visually compelling images by seamlessly blending realistic content with artistic styles, enabling applications in photo editing and creative design. While mainstream training-free diffusion-based methods have greatly advanced style transfer in recent years, their reliance on computationally inversion processes compromises efficiency and introduces visual distortions when inversion is inaccurate. To address these limitations, we propose a novel \textit{inversion-free} style transfer framework based on dual rectified flows, which tackles the challenge of finding an unknown stylized distribution from two distinct inputs (content and style images), \textit{only with forward pass}. Our approach predicts content and style trajectories in parallel, then fuses them through a dynamic midpoint interpolation that integrates velocities from both paths while adapting to the evolving stylized image. By jointly modeling the content, style, and stylized distributions, our velocity field design achieves robust fusion and avoids the shortcomings of naive overlays. Attention injection further guides style integration, enhancing visual fidelity, content preservation, and computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate generalization across diverse styles and content, providing an effective and efficient pipeline for style transfer.

Conclusion: 该方法为Ref-COD提供了一条简单高效的路径，无需强制参考图像

Abstract: Referring Camouflaged Object Detection (Ref-COD) segments specified camouflaged objects in a scene by leveraging a small set of referring images. Though effective, current systems adopt a dual-branch design that requires reference images at test time, which limits deployability and adds latency and data-collection burden. We introduce a Ref-COD framework that distills references into a class-prototype memory during training and synthesizes a reference vector at inference via a query-conditioned mixture of prototypes. Concretely, we maintain an EMA-updated prototype per category and predict mixture weights from the query to produce a guidance vector without any test-time references. To bridge the representation gap between reference statistics and camouflaged query features, we propose a bidirectional attention alignment module that adapts both the query features and the class representation. Thus, our approach yields a simple, efficient path to Ref-COD without mandatory references. We evaluate the proposed method on the large-scale R2C7K benchmark. Extensive experiments demonstrate competitive or superior performance of the proposed method compared with recent state-of-the-arts. Code is available at https://github.com/yuhuan-wu/RefOnce.

Abstract: Accurately localizing and segmenting obscured objects from faint light patterns beyond the field of view is highly challenging due to multiple scattering and medium-induced perturbations. Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are increasingly deployed for vision-language tasks that produce explicit intermediate rationales. However, reasoning traces can contain unsafe content even when the final answer is non-harmful, creating deployment risks. Existing multimodal safety guards primarily evaluate only the input question and the final answer, neglecting the intermediate reasoning process. This oversight allows undetected harm, such as biased inferences or policy-violating use of visual context, to emerge during reasoning. We introduce GuardTrace-VL, a vision-aware safety auditor that monitors the full Question-Thinking-Answer (QTA) pipeline via joint image-text analysis, enabling detection of unsafe content as it emerges in the reasoning stage. To support training and evaluation, we construct the GuardTrace dataset, which is generated through diverse prompting strategies and refined via a MLRM- and human-based voting and verification pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a three-stage progressive training scheme combined with the data refinement process, enabling the model to learn nuanced and context-dependent safety preferences according to different risk levels. On our proposed test set covering both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, GuardTrace-VL model achieves an F1 score of 93.1% on unsafe reasoning detection tasks, representing a 13.5% improvement in F1 score compared to the previous strongest multimodal safety defense methods. The codes will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Images can be viewed as layered compositions, foreground objects over background, with potential occlusions. This layered representation enables independent editing of elements, offering greater flexibility for content creation. Despite the progress in large generative models, decomposing a single image into layers remains challenging due to limited methods and data. We observe a strong connection between layer decomposition and in/outpainting tasks, and propose adapting a diffusion-based inpainting model for layer decomposition using lightweight finetuning. To further preserve detail in the latent space, we introduce a novel multi-modal context fusion module with linear attention complexity. Our model is trained purely on a synthetic dataset constructed from open-source assets and achieves superior performance in object removal and occlusion recovery, unlocking new possibilities in downstream editing and creative applications.

Abstract: News image captioning aims to produce journalistically informative descriptions by combining visual content with contextual cues from associated articles. Despite recent advances, existing methods struggle with three key challenges: (1) incomplete information coverage, (2) weak cross-modal alignment, and (3) suboptimal visual-entity grounding. To address these issues, we introduce MERGE, the first Multimodal Entity-aware Retrieval-augmented GEneration framework for news image captioning. MERGE constructs an entity-centric multimodal knowledge base (EMKB) that integrates textual, visual, and structured knowledge, enabling enriched background retrieval. It improves cross-modal alignment through a multistage hypothesis-caption strategy and enhances visual-entity matching via dynamic retrieval guided by image content. Extensive experiments on GoodNews and NYTimes800k show that MERGE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with CIDEr gains of +6.84 and +1.16 in caption quality, and F1-score improvements of +4.14 and +2.64 in named entity recognition. Notably, MERGE also generalizes well to the unseen Visual News dataset, achieving +20.17 in CIDEr and +6.22 in F1-score, demonstrating strong robustness and domain adaptability.

Conclusion: MetaRank能够基于新目标数据集的文本描述高效排序候选MTE指标，使从业者能够先验地选择最合适的指标。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate pre-trained source model is a critical, yet computationally expensive, task in transfer learning. Model Transferability Estimation (MTE) methods address this by providing efficient proxy metrics to rank models without full fine-tuning. In practice, the choice of which MTE metric to use is often ad hoc or guided simply by a metric's average historical performance. However, we observe that the effectiveness of MTE metrics is highly task-dependent and no single metric is universally optimal across all target datasets. To address this gap, we introduce MetaRank, a meta-learning framework for automatic, task-aware MTE metric selection. We formulate metric selection as a learning-to-rank problem. Rather than relying on conventional meta-features, MetaRank encodes textual descriptions of both datasets and MTE metrics using a pretrained language model, embedding them into a shared semantic space. A meta-predictor is then trained offline on diverse meta-tasks to learn the intricate relationship between dataset characteristics and metric mechanisms, optimized with a listwise objective that prioritizes correctly ranking the top-performing metrics. During the subsequent online phase, MetaRank efficiently ranks the candidate MTE metrics for a new, unseen target dataset based on its textual description, enabling practitioners to select the most appropriate metric a priori. Extensive experiments across 11 pretrained models and 11 target datasets demonstrate the strong effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于原型的框架能够更高效和一致地发现跨视图共识，提高多视图分类结果的可信度。

Abstract: Trustworthy multi-view classification (TMVC) addresses the challenge of achieving reliable decision-making in complex scenarios where multi-source information is heterogeneous, inconsistent, or even conflicting. Existing TMVC approaches predominantly rely on globally dense neighbor relationships to model intra-view dependencies, leading to high computational costs and an inability to directly ensure consistency across inter-view relationships. Furthermore, these methods typically aggregate evidence from different views through manually assigned weights, lacking guarantees that the learned multi-view neighbor structures are consistent within the class space, thus undermining the trustworthiness of classification outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel TMVC framework that introduces prototypes to represent the neighbor structures of each view. By simplifying the learning of intra-view neighbor relations and enabling dynamic alignment of intra- and inter-view structure, our approach facilitates more efficient and consistent discovery of cross-view consensus. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive downstream performance and robustness compared to prevalent TMVC methods.

TL;DR: CameraMaster是一个统一的相机感知图像修饰框架，通过显式解耦相机指令并整合指令表示和参数嵌入，实现精确的相机参数控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖模糊的文本提示难以精确控制相机参数，要么需要为不同参数训练独立模块，缺乏可扩展性和多参数组合能力。

Method: 使用相机参数嵌入调制相机指令和内容语义，通过交叉注意力将调制后的指令注入内容特征，同时在去噪过程中将指令和相机嵌入作为条件信号进行层间调制。

Result: 实验表明CameraMaster对参数变化产生单调且接近线性的响应，支持无缝多参数组合，并显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CameraMaster通过语义-参数对齐实现了精确可控的图像修饰，在78K图像-提示对数据集上验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Text-guided diffusion models have greatly advanced image editing and generation. However, achieving physically consistent image retouching with precise parameter control (e.g., exposure, white balance, zoom) remains challenging. Existing methods either rely solely on ambiguous and entangled text prompts, which hinders precise camera control, or train separate heads/weights for parameter adjustment, which compromises scalability, multi-parameter composition, and sensitivity to subtle variations. To address these limitations, we propose CameraMaster, a unified camera-aware framework for image retouching. The key idea is to explicitly decouple the camera directive and then coherently integrate two critical information streams: a directive representation that captures the photographer's intent, and a parameter embedding that encodes precise camera settings. CameraMaster first uses the camera parameter embedding to modulate both the camera directive and the content semantics. The modulated directive is then injected into the content features via cross-attention, yielding a strongly camera-sensitive semantic context. In addition, the directive and camera embeddings are injected as conditioning and gating signals into the time embedding, enabling unified, layer-wise modulation throughout the denoising process and enforcing tight semantic-parameter alignment. To train and evaluate CameraMaster, we construct a large-scale dataset of 78K image-prompt pairs annotated with camera parameters. Extensive experiments show that CameraMaster produces monotonic and near-linear responses to parameter variations, supports seamless multi-parameter composition, and significantly outperforms existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法回答图像描述能否在实际下游任务中替代图像的问题，需要基于效用的评估基准

Method: 构建包含4个领域、33,027个密集标注多选题的CaptionQA基准，通过LLM仅使用描述回答问题来直接测量描述效用

Result: 评估显示图像与其描述效用之间存在显著差距，在传统图像QA基准表现相近的模型在描述效用上下降高达32%

Conclusion: CaptionQA揭示了当前图像描述在替代图像完成任务方面的不足，为改进描述生成提供了新方向

Abstract: Image captions serve as efficient surrogates for visual content in multimodal systems such as retrieval, recommendation, and multi-step agentic inference pipelines. Yet current evaluation practices miss a fundamental question: Can captions stand-in for images in real downstream tasks? We propose a utility-based benchmark, CaptionQA, to evaluate model-generated captions, where caption quality is measured by how well it supports downstream tasks. CaptionQA is an extensible domain-dependent benchmark covering 4 domains--Natural, Document, E-commerce, and Embodied AI--each with fine-grained taxonomies (25 top-level and 69 subcategories) that identify useful information for domain-specific tasks. CaptionQA builds 33,027 densely annotated multiple-choice questions (50.3 per image on average) that explicitly require visual information to answer, providing a comprehensive probe of caption utility. In our evaluation protocol, an LLM answers these questions using captions alone, directly measuring whether captions preserve image-level utility and are utilizable by a downstream LLM. Evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals substantial gaps between the image and its caption utility. Notably, models nearly identical on traditional image-QA benchmarks lower by up to 32% in caption utility. We release CaptionQA along with an open-source pipeline for extension to new domains. The code is available at https://github.com/bronyayang/CaptionQA.

Result: 在AIST++和FineDance数据集上的实验表明，FlowerDance在动作质量和生成效率方面均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlowerDance不仅能够生成具有物理合理性和艺术表现力的精细动作，还实现了显著的生成效率提升，为实际应用提供了更好的计算余量。

Abstract: Music-to-dance generation aims to translate auditory signals into expressive human motion, with broad applications in virtual reality, choreography, and digital entertainment. Despite promising progress, the limited generation efficiency of existing methods leaves insufficient computational headroom for high-fidelity 3D rendering, thereby constraining the expressiveness of 3D characters during real-world applications. Thus, we propose FlowerDance, which not only generates refined motion with physical plausibility and artistic expressiveness, but also achieves significant generation efficiency on inference speed and memory utilization . Specifically, FlowerDance combines MeanFlow with Physical Consistency Constraints, which enables high-quality motion generation with only a few sampling steps. Moreover, FlowerDance leverages a simple but efficient model architecture with BiMamba-based backbone and Channel-Level Cross-Modal Fusion, which generates dance with efficient non-autoregressive manner. Meanwhile, FlowerDance supports motion editing, enabling users to interactively refine dance sequences. Extensive experiments on AIST++ and FineDance show that FlowerDance achieves state-of-the-art results in both motion quality and generation efficiency. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Diagnosing lung cancer typically involves physicians identifying lung nodules in Computed tomography (CT) scans and generating diagnostic reports based on their morphological features and medical expertise. Although advancements have been made in using multimodal large language models for analyzing lung CT scans, challenges remain in accurately describing nodule morphology and incorporating medical expertise. These limitations affect the reliability and effectiveness of these models in clinical settings. Collaborative multi-agent systems offer a promising strategy for achieving a balance between generality and precision in medical applications, yet their potential in pathology has not been thoroughly explored. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LungNoduleAgent, an innovative collaborative multi-agent system specifically designed for analyzing lung CT scans. LungNoduleAgent streamlines the diagnostic process into sequential components, improving precision in describing nodules and grading malignancy through three primary modules. The first module, the Nodule Spotter, coordinates clinical detection models to accurately identify nodules. The second module, the Radiologist, integrates localized image description techniques to produce comprehensive CT reports. Finally, the Doctor Agent System performs malignancy reasoning by using images and CT reports, supported by a pathology knowledge base and a multi-agent system framework. Extensive testing on two private datasets and the public LIDC-IDRI dataset indicates that LungNoduleAgent surpasses mainstream vision-language models, agent systems, and advanced expert models. These results highlight the importance of region-level semantic alignment and multi-agent collaboration in diagnosing nodules. LungNoduleAgent stands out as a promising foundational tool for supporting clinical analyses of lung nodules.

Conclusion: 该框架成功调和了基于模型和生成方法之间的差距，通过将生成先验与密集物理约束相结合，实现了更好的去模糊效果。

Abstract: Spatially varying image deblurring remains a fundamentally ill-posed problem, especially when degradations arise from complex mixtures of motion and other forms of blur under significant noise. State-of-the-art learning-based approaches generally fall into two paradigms: model-based deep unrolling methods that enforce physical constraints by modeling the degradations, but often produce over-smoothed, artifact-laden textures, and generative models that achieve superior perceptual quality yet hallucinate details due to weak physical constraints. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that uniquely reconciles these paradigms by taming a powerful generative prior with explicit, dense physical constraints. Rather than oversimplifying the degradation field, we model it as a dense continuum of high-dimensional compressed kernels, ensuring that minute variations in motion and other degradation patterns are captured. We leverage this rich descriptor field to condition a ControlNet architecture, strongly guiding the diffusion sampling process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively bridges the gap between physical accuracy and perceptual realism, outperforming state-of-the-art model-based methods as well as generative baselines in challenging, severely blurred scenarios.

Motivation: 当前图像情感合成方法将生成和编辑任务人为分离，导致效率低下且限制了在治疗干预、故事讲述等自然交织任务中的应用。

Method: 采用概念上与测试时间缩放对齐的策略，利用现成情感分类器进行梯度优化，通过语义相似度确定最佳引导时机，并使用多情感损失减少固有和相似情感的干扰。

Conclusion: MUSE为情感合成建立了新的范式，无需额外更新扩散模型或专门的情感合成数据集。

Abstract: Images evoke emotions that profoundly influence perception, often prioritized over content. Current Image Emotional Synthesis (IES) approaches artificially separate generation and editing tasks, creating inefficiencies and limiting applications where these tasks naturally intertwine, such as therapeutic interventions or storytelling. In this work, we introduce MUSE, the first unified framework capable of both emotional generation and editing. By adopting a strategy conceptually aligned with Test-Time Scaling (TTS) that widely used in both LLM and diffusion model communities, it avoids the requirement for additional updating diffusion model and specialized emotional synthesis datasets. More specifically, MUSE addresses three key questions in emotional synthesis: (1) HOW to stably guide synthesis by leveraging an off-the-shelf emotion classifier with gradient-based optimization of emotional tokens; (2) WHEN to introduce emotional guidance by identifying the optimal timing using semantic similarity as a supervisory signal; and (3) WHICH emotion to guide synthesis through a multi-emotion loss that reduces interference from inherent and similar emotions. Experimental results show that MUSE performs favorably against all methods for both generation and editing, improving emotional accuracy and semantic diversity while maintaining an optimal balance between desired content, adherence to text prompts, and realistic emotional expression. It establishes a new paradigm for emotion synthesis.

Abstract: Image generation can provide physicians with an imaging diagnosis basis in the prediction of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Recent research has shown that long-term AD predictions by image generation often face difficulties maintaining disease-related characteristics when dealing with irregular time intervals in sequential data. Considering that the time-related aspects of the distribution can reflect changes in disease-related characteristics when images are distributed unevenly, this research proposes a model to estimate the temporal parameter within the Normal Inverse Gamma Distribution (T-NIG) to assist in generating images over the long term. The T-NIG model employs brain images from two different time points to create intermediate brain images, forecast future images, and predict the disease. T-NIG is designed by identifying features using coordinate neighborhoods. It incorporates a time parameter into the normal inverse gamma distribution to understand how features change in brain imaging sequences that have varying time intervals. Additionally, T-NIG utilizes uncertainty estimation to reduce both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties in the model, which arise from insufficient temporal data. In particular, the T-NIG model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term prediction tasks within the dataset. Experimental results indicate that T-NIG is proficient in forecasting disease progression while maintaining disease-related characteristics, even when faced with an irregular temporal data distribution.

Conclusion: MIRA通过模拟多轮人机交互过程，有效解决了复杂指令编辑中的语义漂移问题，为指令引导的图像编辑提供了更准确和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing offers an intuitive way for users to edit images with natural language. However, diffusion-based editing models often struggle to accurately interpret complex user instructions, especially those involving compositional relationships, contextual cues, or referring expressions, leading to edits that drift semantically or fail to reflect the intended changes. We tackle this problem by proposing MIRA (Multimodal Iterative Reasoning Agent), a lightweight, plug-and-play multimodal reasoning agent that performs editing through an iterative perception-reasoning-action loop, effectively simulating multi-turn human-model interaction processes. Instead of issuing a single prompt or static plan, MIRA predicts atomic edit instructions step by step, using visual feedback to make its decisions. Our 150K multimodal tool-use dataset, MIRA-Editing, combined with a two-stage SFT + GRPO training pipeline, enables MIRA to perform reasoning and editing over complex editing instructions. When paired with open-source image editing models such as Flux.1-Kontext, Step1X-Edit, and Qwen-Image-Edit, MIRA significantly improves both semantic consistency and perceptual quality, achieving performance comparable to or exceeding proprietary systems such as GPT-Image and Nano-Banana.

Abstract: Iris authentication algorithms have achieved impressive recognition performance, making them highly promising for real-world applications such as border control, citizen identification, and both criminal investigations and commercial systems. However, their robustness is still challenged by variations in rotation, scale, specular reflections, and defocus blur. In addition, most existing approaches rely on straightforward point-to-point comparisons, typically using cosine or L2 distance, without effectively leveraging the spatio-spatial-temporal structure of iris patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a novel and generalized matching pipeline that learns rich spatio-spatial-temporal representations of iris features. Our approach first splits each iris image along one dimension, generating a sequence of sub-images that serve as input to a 3D-CNN, enabling the network to capture both spatial and spatio-spatial-temporal cues. To further enhance the modeling of spatio-spatial-temporal feature dynamics, we train the model in curriculum manner. This design allows the network to embed temporal dependencies directly into the feature space, improving discriminability in the deep metric domain. The framework is trained end-to-end with triplet and ArcFace loss in a curriculum manner, enforcing highly discriminative embeddings despite challenges like rotation, scale, reflections, and blur. This design yields a robust and generalizable solution for iris authentication.Github code: https://github.com/GeetanjaliGTZ/CLRecogEye

Abstract: Radar sensors provide reliable perception across adverse weather, lighting, and long-range conditions. Recent advances in foundation models have transformed visual and language understanding, yet their integration with radar sensing remains largely underexplored. Existing radar approaches are fragmented and task-specific; each downstream task employs distinct architectures and training objectives, preventing transfer across tasks. In this work, we introduce RadarFM: a radar foundation model that learns unified scene-level representations through structured spatial language supervision. We make two key contributions: (1) a structured caption framework that encodes vehicle distributions in native radar coordinates, and (2) a hash-aware contrastive learning objective that quantifies continuous scene similarity rather than binary matching, enabling fine-grained spatial reasoning. Leveraging the CARLA simulator, we generate large-scale, well-annotated radar datasets across diverse driving scenarios. We also propose localization-aware metrics that assess spatial accuracy beyond traditional detection measures.

Motivation: 现有高效MLLMs压缩视觉token会损失视觉信息，降低理解能力；传统知识蒸馏方法忽视了师生模型间视觉token不平衡导致的细粒度视觉理解差异。

Method: 1) 使用曼哈顿距离和匈牙利匹配算法在空间维度对齐师生视觉token；2) 提出视觉语言亲和度蒸馏(VLAD)和视觉语义蒸馏(VSD)两种策略，分别最小化亲和度矩阵的平滑L1距离和使用反向KL散度度量词汇空间分布。

Conclusion: EM-KD通过有效的视觉token对齐和双重蒸馏策略，成功提升了高效MLLMs的性能，验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) compress vision tokens to reduce resource consumption, but the loss of visual information can degrade comprehension capabilities. Although some priors introduce Knowledge Distillation to enhance student models, they overlook the fundamental differences in fine-grained vision comprehension caused by unbalanced vision tokens between the efficient student and vanilla teacher. In this paper, we propose EM-KD, a novel paradigm that enhances the Efficient MLLMs with Knowledge Distillation. To overcome the challenge of unbalanced vision tokens, we first calculate the Manhattan distance between the vision logits of teacher and student, and then align them in the spatial dimension with the Hungarian matching algorithm. After alignment, EM-KD introduces two distillation strategies: 1) Vision-Language Affinity Distillation (VLAD) and 2) Vision Semantic Distillation (VSD). Specifically, VLAD calculates the affinity matrix between text tokens and aligned vision tokens, and minimizes the smooth L1 distance of the student and the teacher affinity matrices. Considering the semantic richness of vision logits in the final layer, VSD employs the reverse KL divergence to measure the discrete probability distributions of the aligned vision logits over the vocabulary space. Comprehensive evaluation on diverse benchmarks demonstrates that EM-KD trained model outperforms prior Efficient MLLMs on both accuracy and efficiency with a large margin, validating its effectiveness. Compared with previous distillation methods, which are equipped with our proposed vision token matching strategy for fair comparison, EM-KD also achieves better performance.

TL;DR: AnchorOPT是一个动态锚点提示学习框架，通过动态学习锚点值和位置关系来改进CLIP模型的泛化能力，无需额外可学习模块或正则化技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习方法使用静态的文本标记作为锚点来指导可学习软标记，但这些锚点在值和位置上都缺乏跨任务和阶段自适应的灵活性。

Method: 提出AnchorOPT框架，在锚点值和位置关系两个维度引入动态性：从任务特定数据动态学习锚点值，并通过可学习位置矩阵自适应优化锚点与软标记的位置关系。采用两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅使用简单的可学习锚点和位置矩阵就能达到或超过一些包含额外可学习模块或正则化技术的方法的性能。作为即插即用模块，在多个数据集上均能带来一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: AnchorOPT通过动态锚点机制有效提升了CLIP模型的泛化能力，且具有良好的可扩展性和实用性。

Abstract: Existing prompt learning methods, which are built upon CLIP models, leverage textual tokens as anchors to guide the learnable soft tokens. This guidance improves CLIP generalizations. However, these anchors-static in both value and position-lack cross-task and stage-adaptive flexibility. To address this limitation, we propose AnchorOPT, a dynamic anchor-based prompt learning framework. Specifically, AnchorOPT introduces dynamism in two key dimensions: (i) anchor values eschew handcrafted explicit textual tokens (e.g., "shape", "color"), instead learning dynamically from task-specific data; and (ii) the positional relationship between anchor and soft tokens is no longer fixed but adaptively optimized via a learnable position matrix conditioned on the training stage and task context. Training occurs in two stages: we first learn the anchor tokens, then freeze and transfer them to the second stage for optimization of soft tokens and the position matrix. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using only a simple learnable anchor and position matrix achieves performance comparable to or exceeding some methods incorporating additional learnable modules or regularization techniques. As a plug-and-play module, AnchorOPT integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks, yielding consistent performance gains across diverse datasets.

TL;DR: FaithFusion是一个基于像素级期望信息增益(EIG)的3DGS-扩散模型融合框架，用于可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成，解决了几何保真度和视觉真实性的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可控驾驶场景重建和3D场景生成中，保持几何保真度同时在大视角变化下合成视觉可信的外观至关重要。然而，基于几何的3DGS和外观驱动的扩散模型的有效融合面临挑战，缺乏像素级、3D一致的编辑标准往往导致过度修复和几何漂移。

Method: 引入基于像素级期望信息增益(EIG)的统一策略：EIG作为空间先验指导扩散模型细化高不确定性区域，同时通过像素级权重将编辑结果蒸馏回3DGS。这是一个即插即用的系统，无需额外先验条件和结构修改。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在NTA-IoU、NTL-IoU和FID指标上达到最先进性能，即使在6米车道偏移时仍保持107.47的FID分数。

Conclusion: FaithFusion通过EIG驱动的融合框架成功解决了3DGS和扩散模型融合中的几何保真度和视觉真实性问题，实现了可控驾驶场景的高质量重建和生成。

Abstract: In controllable driving-scene reconstruction and 3D scene generation, maintaining geometric fidelity while synthesizing visually plausible appearance under large viewpoint shifts is crucial. However, effective fusion of geometry-based 3DGS and appearance-driven diffusion models faces inherent challenges, as the absence of pixel-wise, 3D-consistent editing criteria often leads to over-restoration and geometric drift. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{FaithFusion}, a 3DGS-diffusion fusion framework driven by pixel-wise Expected Information Gain (EIG). EIG acts as a unified policy for coherent spatio-temporal synthesis: it guides diffusion as a spatial prior to refine high-uncertainty regions, while its pixel-level weighting distills the edits back into 3DGS. The resulting plug-and-play system is free from extra prior conditions and structural modifications.Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our approach attains SOTA performance across NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID, maintaining an FID of 107.47 even at 6 meters lane shift.

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型中的视觉干扰信息会导致准确率下降但不会增加推理长度，这与文本干扰信息的影响不同。研究提出了Idis数据集来分析语义、数值和空间维度的干扰，并提出了简单的提示策略来减轻偏见驱动的预测。


<details>

Motivation: 研究视觉干扰信息如何影响视觉语言模型的测试时扩展，探索多模态环境中是否存在与语言模型类似的逆缩放效应。

Method: 引入Idis视觉问答数据集，系统地在语义、数值和空间维度上变化干扰信息，分析推理轨迹中的属性计数，并提出简单的提示策略。

Result: 视觉干扰信息与文本干扰信息有根本差异：虽然逆缩放效应仍然存在，但添加视觉干扰会降低准确率而不增加推理长度。属性计数跟踪揭示了干扰信息、推理长度和准确率之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: 视觉干扰信息对视觉语言模型的影响与文本干扰信息不同，研究提出的方法能够有效分析这种影响并减轻偏见驱动的预测。

Abstract: How does irrelevant information (i.e., distractors) affect test-time scaling in vision-language models (VLMs)? Prior studies on language models have reported an inverse scaling effect, where textual distractors lead to longer but less effective reasoning. To investigate whether similar phenomena occur in multimodal settings, we introduce Idis (Images with distractors), a visual question-answering dataset that systematically varies distractors along semantic, numerical, and spatial dimensions. Our analyses reveal that visual distractors differ fundamentally from textual ones: although inverse scaling persists, adding visual distractors reduces accuracy without increasing reasoning length. We further show that tracking attribute counts within reasoning traces provides key insights into how distractors, reasoning length, and accuracy interact. Finally, we demonstrate that these trends extend to established visual bias benchmarks such as Waterbirds, and we propose a simple prompting strategy to mitigate bias-driven predictions in reasoning models.

TL;DR: 提出一种名为DATGN的变形感知时序生成网络，用于自动学习脑部MRI图像中与阿尔茨海默病进展相关的形态变化，实现早期预测。该方法能处理不完整的时间序列数据，生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像，显著提升分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是一种退行性脑部疾病，早期预测有助于延缓病情进展。当前预测方法主要依赖手动特征提取来分析脑部图像的形态变化，存在自动化程度低的问题。

Method: DATGN首先对不完整的MRI时间序列进行插值，然后通过双向时序变形感知模块引导网络生成符合疾病进展的未来MRI图像。该方法能够自动学习形态变化，无需手动特征提取。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上的实验结果显示，DATGN在PSNR和MMSE图像质量指标上表现优异。将DATGN生成的合成数据集成到SVM、CNN和3DCNN分类方法中，AD vs NC分类准确率提升了6.21%到16%，AD vs MCI vs NC分类准确率提升了7.34%到21.25%。

Conclusion: DATGN能够生成与阿尔茨海默病脑萎缩趋势一致的MRI图像，支持早期疾病预测。该方法在自动化学习和分类性能方面均表现出显著优势。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), a degenerative brain condition, can benefit from early prediction to slow its progression. As the disease progresses, patients typically undergo brain atrophy. Current prediction methods for Alzheimers disease largely involve analyzing morphological changes in brain images through manual feature extraction. This paper proposes a novel method, the Deformation-Aware Temporal Generative Network (DATGN), to automate the learning of morphological changes in brain images about disease progression for early prediction. Given the common occurrence of missing data in the temporal sequences of MRI images, DATGN initially interpolates incomplete sequences. Subsequently, a bidirectional temporal deformation-aware module guides the network in generating future MRI images that adhere to the disease's progression, facilitating early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. DATGN was tested for the generation of temporal sequences of future MRI images using the ADNI dataset, and the experimental results are competitive in terms of PSNR and MMSE image quality metrics. Furthermore, when DATGN-generated synthetic data was integrated into the SVM vs. CNN vs. 3DCNN-based classification methods, significant improvements were achieved from 6. 21\% to 16\% in AD vs. NC classification accuracy and from 7. 34\% to 21. 25\% in AD vs. MCI vs. NC classification accuracy. The qualitative visualization results indicate that DATGN produces MRI images consistent with the brain atrophy trend in Alzheimer's disease, enabling early disease prediction.

TL;DR: 提出EntPruner，一种基于熵引导的自动渐进式剪枝框架，用于扩散和流模型，通过条件熵偏差评估模块重要性，实现2.22倍推理加速同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉生成模型在下游任务中存在显著参数冗余，需要一种专门针对生成模型的剪枝方法，既要减少参数又要保持输出分布的多样性和条件保真度。

Method: 1. 熵引导剪枝：使用数据依赖的条件熵偏差(CED)评估模块重要性；2. 零样本自适应剪枝框架：自动确定何时剪枝和剪枝多少，避免一次性剪枝的问题。

Result: 在DiT和SiT模型上的实验表明，EntPruner实现了最高2.22倍的推理加速，在ImageNet和三个下游数据集上保持了竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: EntPruner为生成模型提供了一种有效的剪枝解决方案，在显著加速推理的同时保持了模型性能，解决了生成模型剪枝中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale vision generative models, including diffusion and flow models, have demonstrated remarkable performance in visual generation tasks. However, transferring these pre-trained models to downstream tasks often results in significant parameter redundancy. In this paper, we propose EntPruner, an entropy-guided automatic progressive pruning framework for diffusion and flow models. First, we introduce entropy-guided pruning, a block-level importance assessment strategy specifically designed for generative models. Unlike discriminative models, generative models require preserving the diversity and condition-fidelity of the output distribution. As the importance of each module can vary significantly across downstream tasks, EntPruner prioritizes pruning of less important blocks using data-dependent Conditional Entropy Deviation (CED) as a guiding metric. CED quantifies how much the distribution diverges from the learned conditional data distribution after removing a block. Second, we propose a zero-shot adaptive pruning framework to automatically determine when and how much to prune during training. This dynamic strategy avoids the pitfalls of one-shot pruning, mitigating mode collapse, and preserving model performance. Extensive experiments on DiT and SiT models demonstrate the effectiveness of EntPruner, achieving up to 2.22$\times$ inference speedup while maintaining competitive generation quality on ImageNet and three downstream datasets.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间智能方面缺乏鲁棒性，主要原因是缺少从2D图像重建3D空间的视觉几何学习过程。

Method: 提出G²VLM模型，利用学习到的3D视觉几何特征直接预测3D属性，并通过上下文学习和交错推理增强空间推理任务，采用统一设计可扩展训练多视角图像和视频数据。

Result: 实验结果显示G²VLM在3D重建任务上达到最先进水平，在空间理解和推理任务上取得更好或具有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 通过将语义强大的VLM与低级3D视觉任务统一，G²VLM可作为社区的强基线，并解锁更多未来应用如3D场景编辑。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intelligence: spatial 3D reconstruction and spatial understanding. G$^2$VLM natively leverages learned 3D visual geometry features to directly predict 3D attributes and enhance spatial reasoning tasks via in-context learning and interleaved reasoning. Our unified design is highly scalable for spatial understanding: it trains on abundant multi-view image and video data, while simultaneously leveraging the benefits of 3D visual priors that are typically only derived from hard-to-collect annotations. Experimental results demonstrate G$^2$VLM is proficient in both tasks, achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and achieving better or competitive results across spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. By unifying a semantically strong VLM with low-level 3D vision tasks, we hope G$^2$VLM can serve as a strong baseline for the community and unlock more future applications, such as 3D scene editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度网络仍处于像素级学习阶段，无法让去模糊模型理解模糊的本质。模糊是由清晰图像与模糊核卷积自然引起的，因此让网络在核级学习模糊过程能显著提升图像去模糊性能。

Method: 提出傅里叶核估计器(FKE)，将卷积对象从图像改为网络提取的特征，利用特征的丰富语义和结构信息。设计了具有可逆策略的解耦多尺度架构，包含多个分层子Unet，实现低训练内存下的多尺度编码解码。

Conclusion: 该方法通过核级模糊过程学习，显著提升了图像去模糊性能，为处理核相关问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: It is well-known that if a network aims to learn how to deblur, it should understand the blur process. Blurring is naturally caused by the convolution of the sharp image with the blur kernel. Thus, allowing the network to learn the blur process in the kernel-level can significantly improve the image deblurring performance. But, current deep networks are still at the pixel-level learning stage, either performing end-to-end pixel-level restoration or stage-wise pseudo kernel-level restoration, failing to enable the deblur model to understand the essence of the blur. To this end, we propose Fourier Kernel Estimator (FKE), which considers the activation operation in Fourier space and converts the convolution problem in the spatial domain to a multiplication problem in Fourier space. Our FKE, jointly optimized with the deblur model, enables the network to learn the kernel-level blur process with low complexity and without any additional supervision. Furthermore, we change the convolution object of the kernel from ``image" to network extracted ``feature", whose rich semantic and structural information is more suitable to blur process learning. With the convolution of the feature and the estimated kernel, our model can learn the essence of blur in kernel-level. To further improve the efficiency of feature extraction, we design a decoupled multi-scale architecture with multiple hierarchical sub-unets with a reversible strategy, which allows better multi-scale encoding and decoding in low training memory. Extensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art motion deblurring results and show potential for handling other kernel-related problems. Analysis also shows our kernel estimator is able to learn physically meaningful kernels. The code will be available at https://github.com/DeepMed-Lab-ECNU/Single-Image-Deblur.

Abstract: Human video generation has advanced rapidly with the development of diffusion models, but the high computational cost and substantial memory consumption associated with training these models on high-resolution, multi-frame data pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Entropy-Guided Prioritized Progressive Learning (Ent-Prog), an efficient training framework tailored for diffusion models on human video generation. First, we introduce Conditional Entropy Inflation (CEI) to assess the importance of different model components on the target conditional generation task, enabling prioritized training of the most critical components. Second, we introduce an adaptive progressive schedule that adaptively increases computational complexity during training by measuring the convergence efficiency. Ent-Prog reduces both training time and GPU memory consumption while maintaining model performance. Extensive experiments across three datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of Ent-Prog, achieving up to 2.2$\times$ training speedup and 2.4$\times$ GPU memory reduction without compromising generative performance.

TL;DR: ProxyFormer是一个新的参考视频对象分割架构，通过引入代理查询来整合视觉和文本语义，解决现有方法在跨帧依赖性和文本约束集成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RVOS方法存在两个主要问题：(1)条件查询缺乏帧间依赖性和变化建模，难以在帧间显著变化时准确跟踪目标；(2)文本约束集成过晚，可能导致视频特征关注非参考对象。

Method: 提出ProxyFormer架构，引入代理查询集来整合视觉和文本语义，通过多阶段视频特征编码器逐步更新和传播代理查询。将跨模态交互解耦为时间和空间维度以降低计算成本，并设计联合语义一致性训练策略。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的RVOS基准测试上的综合实验表明，ProxyFormer优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ProxyFormer通过代理查询机制有效解决了跨帧依赖性和文本约束集成问题，提高了目标跟踪的准确性和连贯性。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的安全评估方法主要关注静态图像和文本生成，无法捕捉视频生成中的复杂时序动态，因此需要专门针对T2V模型的安全评估框架。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：初始生成器训练和时间感知在线偏好学习，通过优化文本提示来利用时序动态生成违反策略的视频输出，并使用精炼模型循环改进提示的隐蔽性和对抗效果。

Result: 在开源和商业T2V系统上的广泛实验表明，TEAR实现了超过80%的攻击成功率，相比之前最佳结果的57%有显著提升。

Conclusion: TEAR框架有效揭示了T2V模型中与时间动态相关的安全风险，证明了现有安全评估方法的不足，并为T2V模型的安全性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) models are capable of synthesizing high-quality, temporally coherent dynamic video content, but the diverse generation also inherently introduces critical safety challenges. Existing safety evaluation methods,which focus on static image and text generation, are insufficient to capture the complex temporal dynamics in video generation. To address this, we propose a TEmporal-aware Automated Red-teaming framework, named TEAR, an automated framework designed to uncover safety risks specifically linked to the dynamic temporal sequencing of T2V models. TEAR employs a temporal-aware test generator optimized via a two-stage approach: initial generator training and temporal-aware online preference learning, to craft textually innocuous prompts that exploit temporal dynamics to elicit policy-violating video output. And a refine model is adopted to improve the prompt stealthiness and adversarial effectiveness cyclically. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of TEAR across open-source and commercial T2V systems with over 80% attack success rate, a significant boost from prior best result of 57%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全局原生分辨率视觉编码在MLLMs中计算开销过大的问题，同时保持其性能优势。

Method: 提出渐进式视觉压缩(PVC)方法，包含精细化补丁嵌入和窗口化token压缩两个模块，可在标准ViT中实现高效的原生分辨率编码。

Result: ViT-UHD在保持与MoonViT相当性能的同时，TTFT减少2.4倍；LLaVA-UHD v3在性能接近Qwen2-VL的同时，TTFT进一步减少1.9倍。

Conclusion: PVC方法能够有效平衡MLLMs的性能和效率，为高效多模态大语言模型研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Visual encoding followed by token condensing has become the standard architectural paradigm in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Many recent MLLMs increasingly favor global native- resolution visual encoding over slice-based methods. To investigate this trend, we systematically compare their behavior on vision-language understanding and attention patterns, revealing that global encoding enhances overall capability but at the expense of greater computational overhead. To address this issue, we present LLaVA-UHD v3, an MLLM centered upon our proposed Progressive Visual Compression (PVC) method, which can be seamlessly integrated into standard Vision Transformer (ViT) to enable efficient native-resolution encoding. The PVC approach consists of two key modules: (i) refined patch embedding, which supports flexible patch-size scaling for fine-grained visual model- ing, (ii) windowed token compression, hierarchically deployed across ViT layers to progressively aggregate local token representations. Jointly modulated by these two modules, a widely pretrained ViT can be reconfigured into an efficient architecture while largely preserving generality. Evaluated across extensive benchmarks, the transformed ViT, termed ViT-UHD, demonstrates competitive performance with MoonViT while reducing TTFT (time-to-first-token) by 2.4x, when developed within an identical MLLM architecture. Building upon ViT-UHD, LLaVA-UHD v3 also achieves competitive performance to Qwen2-VL, while further reducing TTFT by 1.9x. We will release all code and checkpoints to support future research on efficient MLLMs.

TL;DR: GridAR是一个针对视觉自回归模型的测试时扩展框架，通过网格分区渐进生成和布局指定提示重构策略，在有限计算资源下提升文本到图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时扩展策略（如Best-of-N）在视觉自回归模型中效果不佳，因为它们会在错误的生成轨迹上消耗完整计算资源，且光栅扫描解码方案缺乏整个画布的蓝图规划。

Method: GridAR采用网格分区渐进生成方案，在同一画布位置生成多个部分候选，早期修剪不可行候选，并将可行候选固定为锚点指导后续解码；同时使用布局指定提示重构策略，通过检查部分视图推断可行布局。

Result: 在N=4时，GridAR比Best-of-N（N=8）在T2I-CompBench++上性能提升14.4%，同时成本降低25.6%；在图像编辑任务中，相比更大N的基线，语义保持度提升13.9%。

Conclusion: GridAR框架有效解决了视觉自回归模型测试时扩展的挑战，在有限计算资源下显著提升了生成质量和效率，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent visual autoregressive (AR) models have shown promising capabilities in text-to-image generation, operating in a manner similar to large language models. While test-time computation scaling has brought remarkable success in enabling reasoning-enhanced outputs for challenging natural language tasks, its adaptation to visual AR models remains unexplored and poses unique challenges. Naively applying test-time scaling strategies such as Best-of-N can be suboptimal: they consume full-length computation on erroneous generation trajectories, while the raster-scan decoding scheme lacks a blueprint of the entire canvas, limiting scaling benefits as only a few prompt-aligned candidates are generated. To address these, we introduce GridAR, a test-time scaling framework designed to elicit the best possible results from visual AR models. GridAR employs a grid-partitioned progressive generation scheme in which multiple partial candidates for the same position are generated within a canvas, infeasible ones are pruned early, and viable ones are fixed as anchors to guide subsequent decoding. Coupled with this, we present a layout-specified prompt reformulation strategy that inspects partial views to infer a feasible layout for satisfying the prompt. The reformulated prompt then guides subsequent image generation to mitigate the blueprint deficiency. Together, GridAR achieves higher-quality results under limited test-time scaling: with N=4, it even outperforms Best-of-N (N=8) by 14.4% on T2I-CompBench++ while reducing cost by 25.6%. It also generalizes to autoregressive image editing, showing comparable edit quality and a 13.9% gain in semantic preservation on PIE-Bench over larger-N baselines.

Conclusion: NDTokenizer3D提供了一个紧凑统一的3D VLM框架，成功连接了语言推理与3D空间理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D vision-language models (VLMs) highlight a strong potential for 3D scene understanding and reasoning. However, effectively tokenizing 3D scenes into holistic scene tokens, and leveraging these tokens across diverse 3D understanding tasks, remain highly challenging. We present NDTokenizer3D, a generalist 3D VLM that performs a wide range of 3D scene understanding tasks while naturally supporting human interactions, thereby bridging language-level reasoning with 3D spatial understanding. The core of our approach is a novel three-stage scene tokenization pipeline built upon a Multi-Scale Normal Distributions Transform (NDT) representation, paired with a Multi-Scale NDT Decoder (MSDec). Specifically, NDTokenizer3D first constructs a multi-scale NDT representation from raw high-resolution point clouds, preserving both global context and fine-grained geometric details. Next, the MSDec progressively fuses cross-scale NDT features, producing holistic scene tokens consumable by LLM endpoints. Beyond tokenization, MSDec is repurposed as a general interface for human-interactive prompting (points, boxes, masks) and segmentation-mask decoding, unifying diverse 3D scene understanding tasks within a single architecture. With this compact and unified design, NDTokenizer3D offers a fine-grained, general-purpose 3D VLM, achieving remarkable improvements in 3D Referring Segmentation, 3D Visual Question Answering, and 3D Dense Captioning.

Conclusion: 该工作为VLA模型对抗攻击建立了强基线，为未来防御研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, yet universal and transferable attacks remain underexplored, as most existing patches overfit to a single model and fail in black-box settings. To address this gap, we present a systematic study of universal, transferable adversarial patches against VLA-driven robots under unknown architectures, finetuned variants, and sim-to-real shifts. We introduce UPA-RFAS (Universal Patch Attack via Robust Feature, Attention, and Semantics), a unified framework that learns a single physical patch in a shared feature space while promoting cross-model transfer. UPA-RFAS combines (i) a feature-space objective with an $\ell_1$ deviation prior and repulsive InfoNCE loss to induce transferable representation shifts, (ii) a robustness-augmented two-phase min-max procedure where an inner loop learns invisible sample-wise perturbations and an outer loop optimizes the universal patch against this hardened neighborhood, and (iii) two VLA-specific losses: Patch Attention Dominance to hijack text$\to$vision attention and Patch Semantic Misalignment to induce image-text mismatch without labels. Experiments across diverse VLA models, manipulation suites, and physical executions show that UPA-RFAS consistently transfers across models, tasks, and viewpoints, exposing a practical patch-based attack surface and establishing a strong baseline for future defenses.

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated a remarkable ability to learn rich, transferable representations across diverse modalities such as images, text, and audio. In modern machine learning pipelines, these representations often replace raw data as the primary input for downstream tasks. In this paper, we address the challenge of adapting a pre-trained foundation model to inject domain-specific knowledge, without retraining from scratch or incurring significant computational costs. To this end, we introduce BotaCLIP, a lightweight multimodal contrastive framework that adapts a pre-trained Earth Observation foundation model (DOFA) by aligning high-resolution aerial imagery with botanical relevés. Unlike generic embeddings, BotaCLIP internalizes ecological structure through contrastive learning with a regularization strategy that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. Once trained, the resulting embeddings serve as transferable representations for downstream predictors. Motivated by real-world applications in biodiversity modeling, we evaluated BotaCLIP representations in three ecological tasks: plant presence prediction, butterfly occurrence modeling, and soil trophic group abundance estimation. The results showed consistent improvements over those derived from DOFA and supervised baselines. More broadly, this work illustrates how domain-aware adaptation of foundation models can inject expert knowledge into data-scarce settings, enabling frugal representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度聚类方法存在全局和局部特征结构不一致的问题：局部结构在类内样本间具有强一致性和紧凑性，而全局特征往往边界交织、聚类分离性差。

Method: 首先通过自适应k近邻一致性过滤识别高置信度样本作为可靠锚点，然后利用这些样本计算判别性损失，促进类内紧凑性和类间分离性来指导网络优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，DCBoost显著提升了各种现有深度聚类模型的性能，将当前最先进基线（如ProPos）的性能提高了3%以上，并将轮廓系数放大了7倍以上。

Conclusion: DCBoost是一种有效的参数自由插件方法，能够通过利用可靠的局部结构信息来增强全局特征结构，从而显著提升深度聚类模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent deep clustering models have produced impressive clustering performance. However, a common issue with existing methods is the disparity between global and local feature structures. While local structures typically show strong consistency and compactness within class samples, global features often present intertwined boundaries and poorly separated clusters. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCBoost, a parameter-free plug-in designed to enhance the global feature structures of current deep clustering models. By harnessing reliable local structural cues, our method aims to elevate clustering performance effectively. Specifically, we first identify high-confidence samples through adaptive $k$-nearest neighbors-based consistency filtering, aiming to select a sufficient number of samples with high label reliability to serve as trustworthy anchors for self-supervision. Subsequently, these samples are utilized to compute a discriminative loss, which promotes both intra-class compactness and inter-class separability, to guide network optimization. Extensive experiments across various benchmark datasets showcase that our DCBoost significantly improves the clustering performance of diverse existing deep clustering models. Notably, our method improves the performance of current state-of-the-art baselines (e.g., ProPos) by more than 3% and amplifies the silhouette coefficient by over $7\times$.

Conclusion: ConFu框架能够有效捕捉高阶依赖关系，同时保持强配对对应性，为多模态学习提供了统一的对比学习解决方案。

Abstract: Learning joint representations across multiple modalities remains a central challenge in multimodal machine learning. Prevailing approaches predominantly operate in pairwise settings, aligning two modalities at a time. While some recent methods aim to capture higher-order interactions among multiple modalities, they often overlook or insufficiently preserve pairwise relationships, limiting their effectiveness on single-modality tasks. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Fusion (ConFu), a framework that jointly embeds both individual modalities and their fused combinations into a unified representation space, where modalities and their fused counterparts are aligned. ConFu extends traditional pairwise contrastive objectives with an additional fused-modality contrastive term, encouraging the joint embedding of modality pairs with a third modality. This formulation enables ConFu to capture higher-order dependencies, such as XOR-like relationships, that cannot be recovered through pairwise alignment alone, while still maintaining strong pairwise correspondence. We evaluate ConFu on synthetic and real-world multimodal benchmarks, assessing its ability to exploit cross-modal complementarity, capture higher-order dependencies, and scale with increasing multimodal complexity. Across these settings, ConFu demonstrates competitive performance on retrieval and classification tasks, while supporting unified one-to-one and two-to-one retrieval within a single contrastive framework.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动作识别方法难以捕捉局部区域随时间演变的细微细节，导致对相似动作的区分能力不足。

Method: 使用区域特定语义激活模块，以文本约束语义作为查询捕捉动作相关区域响应，构建动作轨迹，并通过多级轨迹对比约束优化。

Result: 在广泛使用的动作识别基准测试中表现出优于现有最先进基线的性能。

Conclusion: ART框架通过跟踪局部细节动态，有效提升了细粒度动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained action recognition (FGAR) aims to identify subtle and distinctive differences among fine-grained action categories. However, current recognition methods often capture coarse-grained motion patterns but struggle to identify subtle details in local regions evolving over time. In this work, we introduce the Action-Region Tracking (ART) framework, a novel solution leveraging a query-response mechanism to discover and track the dynamics of distinctive local details, enabling effective distinction of similar actions. Specifically, we propose a region-specific semantic activation module that employs discriminative and text-constrained semantics as queries to capture the most action-related region responses in each video frame, facilitating interaction among spatial and temporal dimensions with corresponding video features. The captured region responses are organized into action tracklets, which characterize region-based action dynamics by linking related responses across video frames in a coherent sequence. The text-constrained queries encode nuanced semantic representations derived from textual descriptions of action labels extracted by language branches within Visual Language Models (VLMs). To optimize the action tracklets, we design a multi-level tracklet contrastive constraint among region responses at spatial and temporal levels, enabling effective discrimination within each frame and correlation between adjacent frames. Additionally, a task-specific fine-tuning mechanism refines textual semantics such that semantic representations encoded by VLMs are preserved while optimized for task preferences. Comprehensive experiments on widely used action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the superiority to previous state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 开发低延迟的神经形态信号处理管道，用于实时检测交通基础设施中的结构异常，替代传统基于CNN的方法，提高可解释性和嵌入式硬件效率。

Method: 集成尺度不变特征变换(SIFT)进行空间特征编码，使用延迟驱动的脉冲转换层和泄漏积分点火(LIF)脉冲神经网络(SNN)进行分类。

Result: 在6,000个标记帧的数据集上达到92.3%分类准确率，每帧推理时间9.5毫秒，稀疏脉冲活动率为8.1%，支持实时低功耗边缘部署。

Conclusion: SIFT-SNN框架在保持空间特征基础的同时，增强了可解释性，支持透明决策，并在嵌入式硬件上高效运行，为可移动混凝土护栏的结构安全监测提供了可推广的案例研究。

Abstract: This paper presents the SIFT-SNN framework, a low-latency neuromorphic signal-processing pipeline for real-time detection of structural anomalies in transport infrastructure. The proposed approach integrates Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) for spatial feature encoding with a latency-driven spike conversion layer and a Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Spiking Neural Network (SNN) for classification. The Auckland Harbour Bridge dataset is recorded under various weather and lighting conditions, comprising 6,000 labelled frames that include both real and synthetically augmented unsafe cases. The presented system achieves a classification accuracy of 92.3% (+- 0.8%) with a per-frame inference time of 9.5 ms. Achieved sub-10 millisecond latency, combined with sparse spike activity (8.1%), enables real-time, low-power edge deployment. Unlike conventional CNN-based approaches, the hybrid SIFT-SNN pipeline explicitly preserves spatial feature grounding, enhances interpretability, supports transparent decision-making, and operates efficiently on embedded hardware. Although synthetic augmentation improved robustness, generalisation to unseen field conditions remains to be validated. The SIFT-SNN framework is validated through a working prototype deployed on a consumer-grade system and framed as a generalisable case study in structural safety monitoring for movable concrete barriers, which, as a traffic flow-control infrastructure, is deployed in over 20 cities worldwide.

Motivation: 比较三种生成建模范式的性能差异，特别是迭代采样（DDPM、CFM）与直接一步生成（MeanFlow）的权衡，并探索CFM在图像修复任务中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用统一的TinyUNet架构（<1.5M参数）在CIFAR-10上实现DDPM、CFM和MeanFlow。CFM采用条件流匹配，DDPM使用去噪扩散，MeanFlow通过建模时间间隔内的平均速度实现一步生成。扩展CFM到图像修复，实现四种掩码类型的掩码引导采样。

Conclusion: CFM在生成质量上显著优于DDPM，MeanFlow在保持良好生成质量的同时大幅减少推理时间。CFM在图像修复任务中表现出色，修复感知训练能显著提升修复质量。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive comparative study of three generative modeling paradigms: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), Conditional Flow Matching (CFM), and MeanFlow. While DDPM and CFM require iterative sampling, MeanFlow enables direct one-step generation by modeling the average velocity over time intervals. We implement all three methods using a unified TinyUNet architecture (<1.5M parameters) on CIFAR-10, demonstrating that CFM achieves an FID of 24.15 with 50 steps, significantly outperforming DDPM (FID 402.98). MeanFlow achieves FID 29.15 with single-step sampling -- a 50X reduction in inference time. We further extend CFM to image inpainting, implementing mask-guided sampling with four mask types (center, random bbox, irregular, half). Our fine-tuned inpainting model achieves substantial improvements: PSNR increases from 4.95 to 8.57 dB on center masks (+73%), and SSIM improves from 0.289 to 0.418 (+45%), demonstrating the effectiveness of inpainting-aware training.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have highlighted their potential for medical and surgical applications. However, existing surgical datasets predominantly adopt a Visual Question Answering (VQA) format with heterogeneous taxonomies and lack support for pixel-level segmentation, limiting consistent evaluation and applicability. We present SurgMLLMBench, a unified multimodal benchmark explicitly designed for developing and evaluating interactive multimodal LLMs for surgical scene understanding, including the newly collected Micro-surgical Artificial Vascular anastomosIS (MAVIS) dataset. It integrates pixel-level instrument segmentation masks and structured VQA annotations across laparoscopic, robot-assisted, and micro-surgical domains under a unified taxonomy, enabling comprehensive evaluation beyond traditional VQA tasks and richer visual-conversational interactions. Extensive baseline experiments show that a single model trained on SurgMLLMBench achieves consistent performance across domains and generalizes effectively to unseen datasets. SurgMLLMBench will be publicly released as a robust resource to advance multimodal surgical AI research, supporting reproducible evaluation and development of interactive surgical reasoning models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: T3-Tracer是一个用于检测部分音频伪造的三级框架，通过联合分析帧、片段和音频级别来全面检测伪造痕迹，在三个挑战性数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分音频伪造作为一种新的音频操纵形式，攻击者选择性地修改部分但语义关键帧，同时保持整体感知真实性，使得此类伪造特别难以检测。现有方法缺乏分层结构来捕捉不同时间级别的瞬时和持续异常。

Method: 提出T3-Tracer框架，包含两个核心模块：帧-音频特征聚合模块(FA-FAM)用于检测每个音频帧的真实性，结合帧级和音频级时序信息；片段级多尺度差异感知模块(SMDAM)用于在片段级别检测伪造边界，采用双分支架构联合建模帧特征和跨多尺度时间窗口的帧间差异。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: T3-Tracer通过分层分析框架有效解决了部分音频伪造检测的挑战，为音频取证提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, partial audio forgery has emerged as a new form of audio manipulation. Attackers selectively modify partial but semantically critical frames while preserving the overall perceptual authenticity, making such forgeries particularly difficult to detect. Existing methods focus on independently detecting whether a single frame is forged, lacking the hierarchical structure to capture both transient and sustained anomalies across different temporal levels. To address these limitations, We identify three key levels relevant to partial audio forgery detection and present T3-Tracer, the first framework that jointly analyzes audio at the frame, segment, and audio levels to comprehensively detect forgery traces. T3-Tracer consists of two complementary core modules: the Frame-Audio Feature Aggregation Module (FA-FAM) and the Segment-level Multi-Scale Discrepancy-Aware Module (SMDAM). FA-FAM is designed to detect the authenticity of each audio frame. It combines both frame-level and audio-level temporal information to detect intra-frame forgery cues and global semantic inconsistencies. To further refine and correct frame detection, we introduce SMDAM to detect forgery boundaries at the segment level. It adopts a dual-branch architecture that jointly models frame features and inter-frame differences across multi-scale temporal windows, effectively identifying abrupt anomalies that appeared on the forged boundaries. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: "Thinking with images" has emerged as an effective paradigm for advancing visual reasoning, extending beyond text-only chains of thought by injecting visual evidence into intermediate reasoning steps. However, existing methods fall short of human-like abstract visual thinking, as their flexibility is fundamentally limited by external tools. In this work, we introduce Monet, a training framework that enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to reason directly within the latent visual space by generating continuous embeddings that function as intermediate visual thoughts. We identify two core challenges in training MLLMs for latent visual reasoning: high computational cost in latent-vision alignment and insufficient supervision over latent embeddings, and address them with a three-stage distillation-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) pipeline. We further reveal a limitation of applying GRPO to latent reasoning: it primarily enhances text-based reasoning rather than latent reasoning. To overcome this, we propose VLPO (Visual-latent Policy Optimization), a reinforcement learning method that explicitly incorporates latent embeddings into policy gradient updates. To support SFT, we construct Monet-SFT-125K, a high-quality text-image interleaved CoT dataset containing 125K real-world, chart, OCR, and geometry CoTs. Our model, Monet-7B, shows consistent gains across real-world perception and reasoning benchmarks and exhibits strong out-of-distribution generalization on challenging abstract visual reasoning tasks. We also empirically analyze the role of each training component and discuss our early unsuccessful attempts, providing insights for future developments in visual latent reasoning. Our model, data, and code are available at https://github.com/NOVAglow646/Monet.

Abstract: Facial expressions convey the bulk of emotional information in human communication, yet existing 3D face reconstruction methods often miss subtle affective details due to reliance on 2D supervision and lack of 3D ground truth. We propose FIELDS (Face reconstruction with accurate Inference of Expression using Learning with Direct Supervision) to address these limitations by extending self-supervised 2D image consistency cues with direct 3D expression parameter supervision and an auxiliary emotion recognition branch. Our encoder is guided by authentic expression parameters from spontaneous 4D facial scans, while an intensity-aware emotion loss encourages the 3D expression parameters to capture genuine emotion content without exaggeration. This dual-supervision strategy bridges the 2D/3D domain gap and mitigates expression-intensity bias, yielding high-fidelity 3D reconstructions that preserve subtle emotional cues. From a single image, FIELDS produces emotion-rich face models with highly realistic expressions, significantly improving in-the-wild facial expression recognition performance without sacrificing naturalness.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have shown remarkable performance in recent years on various computer vision problems. However, the traditional convolutional neural network architecture lacks a critical property: shift equivariance and invariance, broken by downsampling and upsampling operations. Although data augmentation techniques can help the model learn the latter property empirically, a consistent and systematic way to achieve this goal is by designing downsampling and upsampling layers that theoretically guarantee these properties by construction. Adaptive Polyphase Sampling (APS) introduced the cornerstone for shift invariance, later extended to shift equivariance with Learnable Polyphase up/downsampling (LPS) applied to real-valued neural networks. In this paper, we extend the work on LPS to complex-valued neural networks both from a theoretical perspective and with a novel building block of a projection layer from $\mathbb{C}$ to $\mathbb{R}$ before the Gumbel Softmax. We finally evaluate this extension on several computer vision problems, specifically for either the invariance property in classification tasks or the equivariance property in both reconstruction and semantic segmentation problems, using polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar images.

Abstract: The threat of Audio-Video (AV) forgery is rapidly evolving beyond human-centric deepfakes to include more diverse manipulations across complex natural scenes. However, existing benchmarks are still confined to DeepFake-based forgeries and single-granularity annotations, thus failing to capture the diversity and complexity of real-world forgery scenarios. To address this, we introduce AVFakeBench, the first comprehensive audio-video forgery detection benchmark that spans rich forgery semantics across both human subject and general subject. AVFakeBench comprises 12K carefully curated audio-video questions, covering seven forgery types and four levels of annotations. To ensure high-quality and diverse forgeries, we propose a multi-stage hybrid forgery framework that integrates proprietary models for task planning with expert generative models for precise manipulation. The benchmark establishes a multi-task evaluation framework covering binary judgment, forgery types classification, forgery detail selection, and explanatory reasoning. We evaluate 11 Audio-Video Large Language Models (AV-LMMs) and 2 prevalent detection methods on AVFakeBench, demonstrating the potential of AV-LMMs as emerging forgery detectors while revealing their notable weaknesses in fine-grained perception and reasoning.

Abstract: Remote sensing change captioning is an emerging and popular research task that aims to describe, in natural language, the content of interest that has changed between two remote sensing images captured at different times. Existing methods typically employ CNNs/Transformers to extract visual representations from the given images or incorporate auxiliary tasks to enhance the final results, with weak region awareness and limited temporal alignment. To address these issues, this paper explores the use of the SAM (Segment Anything Model) foundation model to extract region-level representations and inject region-of-interest knowledge into the captioning framework. Specifically, we employ a CNN/Transformer model to extract global-level vision features, leverage the SAM foundation model to delineate semantic- and motion-level change regions, and utilize a specially constructed knowledge graph to provide information about objects of interest. These heterogeneous sources of information are then fused via cross-attention, and a Transformer decoder is used to generate the final natural language description of the observed changes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple widely used benchmark datasets.

Existing generation methods for LiDAR data only support single frame generation, while existing prediction approaches require multiple frames of historical input and can only deterministically predict multiple frames at once, lacking interactivity. Both paradigms fail to support long-horizon interactive generation. To this end, we introduce LaGen, which to the best of our knowledge is the first framework capable of frame-by-frame autoregressive generation of long-horizon LiDAR scenes. LaGen is able to take a single-frame LiDAR input as a starting point and effectively utilize bounding box information as conditions to generate high-fidelity 4D scene point clouds. In addition, we introduce a scene decoupling estimation module to enhance the model's interactive generation capability for object-level content, as well as a noise modulation module to mitigate error accumulation during long-horizon generation. We construct a protocol based on nuScenes for evaluating long-horizon LiDAR scene generation. Experimental results comprehensively demonstrate LaGen outperforms state-of-the-art LiDAR generation and prediction models, especially on the later frames.

Motivation: 为了解决工业环境中大量未标记人类演示数据的利用问题，为视觉-语言-动作模型预训练提供结构化数据

Method: 首先训练轻量级运动标记器编码运动动态，然后使用基于潜在动作能量指标的无监督动作分割器发现和分割语义一致的动作基元

Result: 在公共基准和专有电机装配数据集上验证了有效分割工作站人类关键任务的能力，通过视觉语言模型确认了发现动作基元的语义一致性

Conclusion: 这是首个从非结构化工业视频中自动提取和组织VLA预训练数据的端到端系统，为制造业中的具身AI集成提供了可扩展解决方案

Abstract: We present a novel unsupervised framework to unlock vast unlabeled human demonstration data from continuous industrial video streams for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model pre-training. Our method first trains a lightweight motion tokenizer to encode motion dynamics, then employs an unsupervised action segmenter leveraging a novel "Latent Action Energy" metric to discover and segment semantically coherent action primitives. The pipeline outputs both segmented video clips and their corresponding latent action sequences, providing structured data directly suitable for VLA pre-training. Evaluations on public benchmarks and a proprietary electric motor assembly dataset demonstrate effective segmentation of key tasks performed by humans at workstations. Further clustering and quantitative assessment via a Vision-Language Model confirm the semantic coherence of the discovered action primitives. To our knowledge, this is the first fully automated end-to-end system for extracting and organizing VLA pre-training data from unstructured industrial videos, offering a scalable solution for embodied AI integration in manufacturing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MatchGS是一个利用3D高斯溅射技术生成高质量图像匹配训练数据的框架，通过几何校正和2D-3D表示对齐，显著提升了零样本图像匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的图像匹配需要大规模、多样化且几何准确的训练数据。3D高斯溅射技术虽然能实现逼真的新视角合成，但其几何不准确性和深度渲染偏差限制了其在对应关系标注中的应用。

Method: 1) 几何保真数据生成管道：精炼3DGS几何以产生精确的对应关系标签；2) 2D-3D表示对齐策略：将3DGS的显式3D知识注入2D匹配器，引导学习视角不变的3D表示。

Result: 生成的对应关系将极线误差降低高达40倍，在公共基准测试中使最先进的匹配器零样本性能提升高达17.7%。

Conclusion: 通过适当的几何精炼，3DGS可以作为可扩展、高保真且结构丰富的数据源，为新一代鲁棒零样本图像匹配器铺平道路。

Abstract: Learning-based image matching critically depends on large-scale, diverse, and geometrically accurate training data. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables photorealistic novel-view synthesis and thus is attractive for data generation. However, its geometric inaccuracies and biased depth rendering currently prevent robust correspondence labeling. To address this, we introduce MatchGS, the first framework designed to systematically correct and leverage 3DGS for robust, zero-shot image matching. Our approach is twofold: (1) a geometrically-faithful data generation pipeline that refines 3DGS geometry to produce highly precise correspondence labels, enabling the synthesis of a vast and diverse range of viewpoints without compromising rendering fidelity; and (2) a 2D-3D representation alignment strategy that infuses 3DGS' explicit 3D knowledge into the 2D matcher, guiding 2D semi-dense matchers to learn viewpoint-invariant 3D representations. Our generated ground-truth correspondences reduce the epipolar error by up to 40 times compared to existing datasets, enable supervision under extreme viewpoint changes, and provide self-supervisory signals through Gaussian attributes. Consequently, state-of-the-art matchers trained solely on our data achieve significant zero-shot performance gains on public benchmarks, with improvements of up to 17.7%. Our work demonstrates that with proper geometric refinement, 3DGS can serve as a scalable, high-fidelity, and structurally-rich data source, paving the way for a new generation of robust zero-shot image matchers.

Abstract: Event cameras produce asynchronous event streams that are spatially sparse yet temporally dense. Mainstream event representation learning algorithms typically use event frames, voxels, or tensors as input. Although these approaches have achieved notable progress, they struggle to address the undersampling problem caused by spatial sparsity. In this paper, we propose a novel hypergraph-guided spatio-temporal event stream completion mechanism, which connects event tokens across different times and spatial locations via hypergraphs and leverages contextual information message passing to complete these sparse events. The proposed method can flexibly incorporate RGB tokens as nodes in the hypergraph within this completion framework, enabling multi-modal hypergraph-based information completion. Subsequently, we aggregate hypergraph node information across different time steps through self-attention, enabling effective learning and fusion of multi-modal features. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-label event classification tasks fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/EvRainDrop.

Abstract: With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Vision Transformer的方法虽然能捕捉全局上下文，但二次复杂度限制了在资源受限平台上的部署效率。Mamba等状态空间模型具有线性时间效率，更适合建模连续道路结构。

Method: 提出PathMamba混合架构，使用Mamba块追踪道路网络的连续性以保持拓扑结构，集成Transformer块利用全局上下文细化特征。

Result: 在DeepGlobe Road Extraction和Massachusetts Roads数据集上达到新的最先进水平，显著提高了拓扑连续性（APLS指标），同时保持计算竞争力。

Conclusion: PathMamba证明了Mamba和Transformer架构的互补优势，能够在避免纯注意力模型高昂扩展成本的同时，生成拓扑优越的分割结果。

Abstract: Achieving both high accuracy and topological continuity in road segmentation from satellite imagery is a critical goal for applications ranging from urban planning to disaster response. State-of-the-art methods often rely on Vision Transformers, which excel at capturing global context, yet their quadratic complexity is a significant barrier to efficient deployment, particularly for on-board processing in resource-constrained platforms. In contrast, emerging State Space Models like Mamba offer linear-time efficiency and are inherently suited to modeling long, continuous structures. We posit that these architectures have complementary strengths. To this end, we introduce PathMamba, a novel hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba's sequential modeling with the Transformer's global reasoning. Our design strategically uses Mamba blocks to trace the continuous nature of road networks, preserving topological structure, while integrating Transformer blocks to refine features with global context. This approach yields topologically superior segmentation maps without the prohibitive scaling costs of pure attention-based models. Our experiments on the DeepGlobe Road Extraction and Massachusetts Roads datasets demonstrate that PathMamba sets a new state-of-the-art. Notably, it significantly improves topological continuity, as measured by the APLS metric, setting a new benchmark while remaining computationally competitive.

Motivation: 现有令牌缩减方法往往忽略了自注意力机制的频率特性，如秩崩溃和过平滑现象，这限制了Vision Transformers的性能提升。

Method: 将令牌分为高频令牌和低频令牌，选择性保留高频令牌，将低频令牌聚合成紧凑的直流令牌以保留必要的低频成分。

Result: 通过广泛实验和分析，该方法在减少计算开销的同时显著提高了准确性，并有效缓解了秩崩溃和过平滑问题。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了Vision Transformers的计算效率，还揭示了先前方法的隐含频率特性和局限性，为后续研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated exceptional performance across various computer vision tasks, yet their quadratic computational complexity concerning token length remains a significant challenge. To address this, token reduction methods have been widely explored. However, existing approaches often overlook the frequency characteristics of self-attention, such as rank collapsing and over-smoothing phenomenon. In this paper, we propose a frequency-aware token reduction strategy that improves computational efficiency while preserving performance by mitigating rank collapsing. Our method partitions tokens into high-frequency tokens and low-frequency tokens. high-frequency tokens are selectively preserved, while low-frequency tokens are aggregated into a compact direct current token to retain essential low-frequency components. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves accuracy while reducing computational overhead and mitigating rank collapsing and over smoothing. Furthermore, we analyze the previous methods, shedding light on their implicit frequency characteristics and limitations.

TL;DR: CaliTex是一个解决3D纹理生成中跨视角不一致问题的框架，通过几何校准注意力机制来显式对齐3D结构，包含部件对齐注意力和条件路由注意力两个模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的3D纹理生成系统存在跨视角不一致问题，即从一个视角看起来可信的纹理在其他视角无法对齐，这源于注意力模糊问题。

Method: 引入几何校准注意力框架，包含部件对齐注意力（强制语义匹配部件间的空间对齐）和条件路由注意力（通过几何条件路径路由外观信息以保持空间保真度），结合两阶段扩散变换器。

Result: CaliTex产生无缝且视角一致的纹理，在开源和商业基准测试中都表现优异。

Conclusion: CaliTex使几何一致性成为网络的固有行为，而非优化的副产品，有效解决了3D纹理生成的跨视角不一致问题。

Abstract: Despite major advances brought by diffusion-based models, current 3D texture generation systems remain hindered by cross-view inconsistency -- textures that appear convincing from one viewpoint often fail to align across others. We find that this issue arises from attention ambiguity, where unstructured full attention is applied indiscriminately across tokens and modalities, causing geometric confusion and unstable appearance-structure coupling. To address this, we introduce CaliTex, a framework of geometry-calibrated attention that explicitly aligns attention with 3D structure. It introduces two modules: Part-Aligned Attention that enforces spatial alignment across semantically matched parts, and Condition-Routed Attention which routes appearance information through geometry-conditioned pathways to maintain spatial fidelity. Coupled with a two-stage diffusion transformer, CaliTex makes geometric coherence an inherent behavior of the network rather than a byproduct of optimization. Empirically, CaliTex produces seamless and view-consistent textures and outperforms both open-source and commercial baselines.

TL;DR: 提出Merge-and-Bound (M&B)方法用于类增量学习，通过参数空间中的权重合并和边界更新来优化模型，减少灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决类增量学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过直接操作模型参数来优化模型，同时保留先前任务的知识。

Method: 使用两种权重合并：任务间权重合并（平均所有先前阶段模型的权重）和任务内权重合并（组合当前阶段的模型参数），并采用边界更新技术最小化累积更新。

Result: 在标准CIL基准测试中表现出色，性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: M&B方法能有效减少灾难性遗忘，且无需修改架构组件或学习目标，可无缝集成到现有CIL方法中。

Abstract: We present a novel training approach, named Merge-and-Bound (M&B) for Class Incremental Learning (CIL), which directly manipulates model weights in the parameter space for optimization. Our algorithm involves two types of weight merging: inter-task weight merging and intra-task weight merging. Inter-task weight merging unifies previous models by averaging the weights of models from all previous stages. On the other hand, intra-task weight merging facilitates the learning of current task by combining the model parameters within current stage. For reliable weight merging, we also propose a bounded update technique that aims to optimize the target model with minimal cumulative updates and preserve knowledge from previous tasks; this strategy reveals that it is possible to effectively obtain new models near old ones, reducing catastrophic forgetting. M&B is seamlessly integrated into existing CIL methods without modifying architecture components or revising learning objectives. We extensively evaluate our algorithm on standard CIL benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VGGT模型在重建大场景时，全局注意力层计算所有视图token的全对全注意力，导致显著的延迟瓶颈，需要加速方法。

Method: 提出头向时间合并(HTTM)，在多头粒度合并token，保持特征独特性，利用空间局部性和时间对应性实现高合并比。

Result: 在GPU推理中实现高达7倍加速，性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: HTTM是有效的训练免费3D token合并方法，能显著加速VGGT模型，同时保持模型表示能力。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) marks a significant leap forward in 3D scene reconstruction, as it is the first model that directly infers all key 3D attributes (camera poses, depths, and dense geometry) jointly in one pass. However, this joint inference mechanism requires global attention layers that perform all-to-all attention computation on tokens from all views. For reconstruction of large scenes with long-sequence inputs, this causes a significant latency bottleneck. In this paper, we propose head-wise temporal merging (HTTM), a training-free 3D token merging method for accelerating VGGT. Existing merging techniques merge tokens uniformly across different attention heads, resulting in identical tokens in the layers' output, which hinders the model's representational ability. HTTM tackles this problem by merging tokens in multi-head granularity, which preserves the uniqueness of feature tokens after head concatenation. Additionally, this enables HTTM to leverage the spatial locality and temporal correspondence observed at the head level to achieve higher merging ratios with lower merging costs compared to existing methods. Thus, HTTM achieves up to 7x acceleration with negligible performance drops in a GPU-based inference.

Conclusion: 该工作提出了通过高效利用多模态知识构建鲁棒3D视觉系统的新实用范式。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a significant threat to learning-based 3D point cloud models, critically undermining their reliability in security-sensitive applications. Existing defense methods often suffer from (1) high computational overhead and (2) poor generalization ability across diverse attack types. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel yet efficient teacher-student framework, namely Multimodal Robust Prompt Distillation (MRPD) for distilling robust 3D point cloud model. It learns lightweight prompts by aligning student point cloud model's features with robust embeddings from three distinct teachers: a vision model processing depth projections, a high-performance 3D model, and a text encoder. To ensure a reliable knowledge transfer, this distillation is guided by a confidence-gated mechanism which dynamically balances the contribution of all input modalities. Notably, since the distillation is all during the training stage, there is no additional computational cost at inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MRPD substantially outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods against a wide range of white-box and black-box attacks, while even achieving better performance on clean data. Our work presents a new, practical paradigm for building robust 3D vision systems by efficiently harnessing multimodal knowledge.

Abstract: We introduce Qwen3-VL, the most capable vision-language model in the Qwen series to date, achieving superior performance across a broad range of multimodal benchmarks. It natively supports interleaved contexts of up to 256K tokens, seamlessly integrating text, images, and video. The model family includes both dense (2B/4B/8B/32B) and mixture-of-experts (30B-A3B/235B-A22B) variants to accommodate diverse latency-quality trade-offs. Qwen3-VL delivers three core pillars: (i) markedly stronger pure-text understanding, surpassing comparable text-only backbones in several cases; (ii) robust long-context comprehension with a native 256K-token window for both text and interleaved multimodal inputs, enabling faithful retention, retrieval, and cross-referencing across long documents and videos; and (iii) advanced multimodal reasoning across single-image, multi-image, and video tasks, demonstrating leading performance on comprehensive evaluations such as MMMU and visual-math benchmarks (e.g., MathVista and MathVision). Architecturally, we introduce three key upgrades: (i) an enhanced interleaved-MRoPE for stronger spatial-temporal modeling across images and video; (ii) DeepStack integration, which effectively leverages multi-level ViT features to tighten vision-language alignment; and (iii) text-based time alignment for video, evolving from T-RoPE to explicit textual timestamp alignment for more precise temporal grounding. Under comparable token budgets and latency constraints, Qwen3-VL achieves superior performance in both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. We envision Qwen3-VL serving as a foundational engine for image-grounded reasoning, agentic decision-making, and multimodal code intelligence in real-world workflows.

Conclusion: 基于多尺度特征聚合的近似策略使模型能够适应不同局部面片的尺度变化，提供最优特征描述

Abstract: Estimating the normal of a point requires constructing a local patch to provide center-surrounding context, but determining the appropriate neighborhood size is difficult when dealing with different data or geometries. Existing methods commonly employ various parameter-heavy strategies to extract a full feature description from the input patch. However, they still have difficulties in accurately and efficiently predicting normals for various point clouds. In this work, we present a new idea of feature extraction for robust normal estimation of point clouds. We use the fusion of multi-scale features from different neighborhood sizes to address the issue of selecting reasonable patch sizes for various data or geometries. We seek to model a patch feature fitting (PFF) based on multi-scale features to approximate the optimal geometric description for normal estimation and implement the approximation process via multi-scale feature aggregation and cross-scale feature compensation. The feature aggregation module progressively aggregates the patch features of different scales to the center of the patch and shrinks the patch size by removing points far from the center. It not only enables the network to precisely capture the structure characteristic in a wide range, but also describes highly detailed geometries. The feature compensation module ensures the reusability of features from earlier layers of large scales and reveals associated information in different patch sizes. Our approximation strategy based on aggregating the features of multiple scales enables the model to achieve scale adaptation of varying local patches and deliver the optimal feature description. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets with fewer network parameters and running time.

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一种实用的解决方案，能够在资源受限设备上高效纠正AI错误，显著提升用户体验，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring minimal computational resources and storage. Our approach combines server-side foundation model training with on-device prototype-based classification, enabling efficient error correction through prototype updates rather than model retraining. The system consists of two key components: (1) a server-side pipeline that leverages knowledge distillation to transfer robust feature representations from foundation models to device-compatible architectures, and (2) a device-side mechanism that enables ultra-efficient error correction through prototype adaptation. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness on both image classification and object detection tasks, achieving over 50% error correction in one-shot scenarios on Food-101 and Flowers-102 datasets while maintaining minimal forgetting (less than 0.02%) and negligible computational overhead. Our implementation, validated through an Android demonstration app, proves the system's practicality in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Endo-G²T是一种用于动态内窥镜场景的几何引导和时间感知训练方案，通过单目深度先验蒸馏、时间嵌入高斯场和关键帧约束流式处理，解决了内窥镜视频中视角依赖效应导致的几何漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频存在强烈的视角依赖效应（如镜面反射、湿润反射和遮挡），纯光度监督与几何不对齐，导致早期几何漂移，错误的形状在密集化过程中被强化且难以纠正。

Method: 1. 几何引导先验蒸馏：将置信度门控的单目深度转换为监督信号，使用尺度不变深度和深度梯度损失，采用预热到上限的调度软注入先验；2. 时间嵌入高斯场：在XYZT中表示动态，采用转子式旋转参数化，实现时间一致的几何；3. 关键帧约束流式处理：在最大点数预算下进行关键帧聚焦优化，非关键帧进行轻量更新。

Result: 在EndoNeRF和StereoMIS-P1数据集上，Endo-G²T在单目重建基线中达到了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: Endo-G²T通过几何引导和时间感知的训练方案，有效解决了动态内窥镜场景中的几何漂移问题，实现了时间一致的高质量重建。

Abstract: Endoscopic (endo) video exhibits strong view-dependent effects such as specularities, wet reflections, and occlusions. Pure photometric supervision misaligns with geometry and triggers early geometric drift, where erroneous shapes are reinforced during densification and become hard to correct. We ask how to anchor geometry early for 4D Gaussian splatting (4DGS) while maintaining temporal consistency and efficiency in dynamic endoscopic scenes. Thus, we present Endo-G$^{2}$T, a geometry-guided and temporally aware training scheme for time-embedded 4DGS. First, geo-guided prior distillation converts confidence-gated monocular depth into supervision with scale-invariant depth and depth-gradient losses, using a warm-up-to-cap schedule to inject priors softly and avoid early overfitting. Second, a time-embedded Gaussian field represents dynamics in XYZT with a rotor-like rotation parameterization, yielding temporally coherent geometry with lightweight regularization that favors smooth motion and crisp opacity boundaries. Third, keyframe-constrained streaming improves efficiency and long-horizon stability through keyframe-focused optimization under a max-points budget, while non-keyframes advance with lightweight updates. Across EndoNeRF and StereoMIS-P1 datasets, Endo-G$^{2}$T achieves state-of-the-art results among monocular reconstruction baselines.

TL;DR: ADVLA是一种针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗攻击框架，通过在视觉编码器到文本特征空间的投影特征上直接应用对抗扰动，有效破坏下游动作预测，具有低幅度、稀疏性和高效性特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法需要昂贵的端到端训练，且通常生成明显的扰动斑块。为了解决这些限制，需要开发更高效、更隐蔽的攻击方法。

Method: 直接在视觉编码器投影到文本特征空间的特征上应用对抗扰动，结合注意力引导使扰动既集中又稀疏，引入三种策略增强敏感性、强制稀疏性和集中扰动。

Result: 在L∞=4/255约束下，ADVLA结合Top-K掩码修改少于10%的斑块，攻击成功率接近100%。扰动集中在关键区域，整体图像几乎不可察觉，单步迭代仅需约0.06秒，显著优于传统基于斑块的攻击。

Conclusion: ADVLA在低幅度和局部稀疏条件下有效削弱VLA模型的下游动作预测，避免了传统斑块攻击的高训练成本和明显扰动，展示了攻击VLA特征空间的独特有效性和实用价值。

Abstract: In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in embodied intelligence have developed rapidly. However, existing adversarial attack methods require costly end-to-end training and often generate noticeable perturbation patches. To address these limitations, we propose ADVLA, a framework that directly applies adversarial perturbations on features projected from the visual encoder into the textual feature space. ADVLA efficiently disrupts downstream action predictions under low-amplitude constraints, and attention guidance allows the perturbations to be both focused and sparse. We introduce three strategies that enhance sensitivity, enforce sparsity, and concentrate perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that under an $L_{\infty}=4/255$ constraint, ADVLA combined with Top-K masking modifies less than 10% of the patches while achieving an attack success rate of nearly 100%. The perturbations are concentrated on critical regions, remain almost imperceptible in the overall image, and a single-step iteration takes only about 0.06 seconds, significantly outperforming conventional patch-based attacks. In summary, ADVLA effectively weakens downstream action predictions of VLA models under low-amplitude and locally sparse conditions, avoiding the high training costs and conspicuous perturbations of traditional patch attacks, and demonstrates unique effectiveness and practical value for attacking VLA feature spaces.

TL;DR: STVG-o1是首个让现成多模态大语言模型在时空视频定位任务上达到最先进性能的框架，无需架构修改，通过边界框思维链机制和多维度强化奖励函数实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型具有强大的语言理解能力，但由于训练目标不对齐和标准视觉编码器中细粒度区域-词语对齐较弱，在时空视频定位任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出边界框思维链机制，在最终预测前明确推理时空位置；设计包含格式、一致性、时间、空间和思考奖励的多维度强化奖励函数，通过强化微调提供几何感知监督。

Result: 在HCSTVG-v1/v2和VidSTG上评估，STVG-o1在HCSTVG上创下新的最先进结果，在HCSTVG-v1上比最佳任务特定方法提高7.3% m_tIoU，在VidSTG上与专用模型相当，大幅超越所有现有基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: STVG-o1展示了多模态大语言模型作为精确时空定位任务可行且强大骨干的潜力，并表现出强大的跨数据集开放词汇泛化能力。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) requires localizing a target object in untrimmed videos both temporally and spatially from natural language descriptions. Despite their strong language understanding, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) underperform on STVG due to misaligned training objectives and weak fine-grained region-word alignment in standard visual encoders. To address this, we propose STVG-o1, the first framework that enables off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve state-of-the-art STVG performance without any architectural modifications. Our method introduces a bounding-box chain-of-thought mechanism that explicitly reasons about spatio-temporal locations in an intermediate step before producing the final prediction. We further design a multi-dimensional reinforcement reward function consisting of format, consistency, temporal, spatial, and think rewards, which provides geometry-aware supervision through reinforcement fine-tuning. Evaluated on HCSTVG-v1/v2 and VidSTG, STVG-o1 sets new state-of-the-art results on HCSTVG, outperforming the best task-specific method by 7.3\% m\_tIoU on HCSTVG-v1, matching specialized models on VidSTG, and surpassing all existing MLLM-based approaches by large margins. It also demonstrates strong open-vocabulary generalization across datasets, establishing MLLMs as viable and powerful backbones for precise spatio-temporal grounding. Our code and models will be released.

TL;DR: DiverseVAR框架通过文本嵌入噪声注入和尺度旅行精炼技术，在不重新训练或微调的情况下提升视觉自回归模型的多样性，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型(VAR)在图像生成中表现出色，但存在多样性不足的问题，即使对于简单提示也会产生几乎相同的图像。这个问题在目前以图像质量为主的关注中被忽视了。

Method: 1. 在文本嵌入中注入噪声以增强多样性；2. 提出尺度旅行精炼技术，使用多尺度自编码器提取粗尺度标记，在中间阶段恢复生成以保持图像质量。

Result: 结合文本嵌入噪声注入和尺度旅行精炼，在显著提升多样性的同时最小化图像质量下降，在多样性-质量权衡中达到了新的帕累托前沿。

Conclusion: DiverseVAR框架有效解决了VAR模型的多样性限制问题，通过简单的测试时技术实现了多样性增强，为视觉自回归模型的实际应用提供了重要改进。

Abstract: We introduce DiverseVAR, a framework that enhances the diversity of text-conditioned visual autoregressive models (VAR) at test time without requiring retraining, fine-tuning, or substantial computational overhead. While VAR models have recently emerged as strong competitors to diffusion and flow models for image generation, they suffer from a critical limitation in diversity, often producing nearly identical images even for simple prompts. This issue has largely gone unnoticed amid the predominant focus on image quality. We address this limitation at test time in two stages. First, inspired by diversity enhancement techniques in diffusion models, we propose injecting noise into the text embedding. This introduces a trade-off between diversity and image quality: as diversity increases, the image quality sharply declines. To preserve quality, we propose scale-travel: a novel latent refinement technique inspired by time-travel strategies in diffusion models. Specifically, we use a multi-scale autoencoder to extract coarse-scale tokens that enable us to resume generation at intermediate stages. Extensive experiments show that combining text-embedding noise injection with our scale-travel refinement significantly enhances diversity while minimizing image-quality degradation, achieving a new Pareto frontier in the diversity-quality trade-off.

TL;DR: E-M3RF是一个等变多模态3D重组框架，通过结合几何和颜色特征，使用SE(3)流匹配来预测碎片重组所需的变换，在几何特征不足或模糊的情况下表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的3D重组方法主要依赖几何特征，当几何信息不足（如小碎片、腐蚀碎片或对称碎片）时表现不佳，且缺乏防止重叠组装的物理约束。

Method: 使用等变旋转编码器提取几何特征，结合颜色特征的transformer编码，形成多模态表示，通过SE(3)流匹配预测碎片变换。

Result: 在RePAIR数据集上，相比竞争方法，旋转误差降低23.1%，平移误差降低13.2%，Chamfer距离减少18.4%。

Conclusion: E-M3RF通过多模态特征融合有效解决了仅依赖几何特征的局限性，在合成和真实文化遗产数据集上都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: 3D reassembly is a fundamental geometric problem, and in recent years it has increasingly been challenged by deep learning methods rather than classical optimization. While learning approaches have shown promising results, most still rely primarily on geometric features to assemble a whole from its parts. As a result, methods struggle when geometry alone is insufficient or ambiguous, for example, for small, eroded, or symmetric fragments. Additionally, solutions do not impose physical constraints that explicitly prevent overlapping assemblies. To address these limitations, we introduce E-M3RF, an equivariant multimodal 3D reassembly framework that takes as input the point clouds, containing both point positions and colors of fractured fragments, and predicts the transformations required to reassemble them using SE(3) flow matching. Each fragment is represented by both geometric and color features: i) 3D point positions are encoded as rotationconsistent geometric features using a rotation-equivariant encoder, ii) the colors at each 3D point are encoded with a transformer. The two feature sets are then combined to form a multimodal representation. We experimented on four datasets: two synthetic datasets, Breaking Bad and Fantastic Breaks, and two real-world cultural heritage datasets, RePAIR and Presious, demonstrating that E-M3RF on the RePAIR dataset reduces rotation error by 23.1% and translation error by 13.2%, while Chamfer Distance decreases by 18.4% compared to competing methods.

Abstract: Recently, video generation has witnessed rapid advancements, drawing increasing attention to image-to-video (I2V) synthesis on mobile devices. However, the substantial computational complexity and slow generation speed of diffusion models pose significant challenges for real-time, high-resolution video generation on resource-constrained mobile devices. In this work, we propose MobileI2V, a 270M lightweight diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation on mobile devices. The core lies in: (1) We analyzed the performance of linear attention modules and softmax attention modules on mobile devices, and proposed a linear hybrid architecture denoiser that balances generation efficiency and quality. (2) We design a time-step distillation strategy that compresses the I2V sampling steps from more than 20 to only two without significant quality loss, resulting in a 10-fold increase in generation speed. (3) We apply mobile-specific attention optimizations that yield a 2-fold speed-up for attention operations during on-device inference. MobileI2V enables, for the first time, fast 720p image-to-video generation on mobile devices, with quality comparable to existing models. Under one-step conditions, the generation speed of each frame of 720p video is less than 100 ms. Our code is available at: https://github.com/hustvl/MobileI2V.

Result: 在目标检测和图像分割任务上超越现有特征蒸馏和混合蒸馏方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: CanKD作为注意力引导蒸馏的新范式，在计算机视觉任务中展现出巨大潜力

Abstract: We propose Cross-Attention-based Non-local Knowledge Distillation (CanKD), a novel feature-based knowledge distillation framework that leverages cross-attention mechanisms to enhance the knowledge transfer process. Unlike traditional self-attention-based distillation methods that align teacher and student feature maps independently, CanKD enables each pixel in the student feature map to dynamically consider all pixels in the teacher feature map. This non-local knowledge transfer more thoroughly captures pixel-wise relationships, improving feature representation learning. Our method introduces only an additional loss function to achieve superior performance compared with existing attention-guided distillation methods. Extensive experiments on object detection and image segmentation tasks demonstrate that CanKD outperforms state-of-the-art feature and hybrid distillation methods. These experimental results highlight CanKD's potential as a new paradigm for attention-guided distillation in computer vision tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/tori-hotaru/CanKD

Abstract: The effectiveness of deepfake detection methods often depends less on their core design and more on implementation details such as data preprocessing, augmentation strategies, and optimization techniques. These factors make it difficult to fairly compare detectors and to understand which factors truly contribute to their performance. To address this, we systematically investigate how different design choices influence the accuracy and generalization capabilities of deepfake detection models, focusing on aspects related to training, inference, and incremental updates. By isolating the impact of individual factors, we aim to establish robust, architecture-agnostic best practices for the design and development of future deepfake detection systems. Our experiments identify a set of design choices that consistently improve deepfake detection and enable state-of-the-art performance on the AI-GenBench benchmark.

Result: 在ANA数据集上，相比现有最佳方法提升7.0% F1-Macro和12.6% mAP，在三个公共医学MIML基准测试中排名前二，将汉明损失和单错误分别降低18.2%和26.9%。

Conclusion: 该框架克服了传统MIML方法的局限性，支持端到端优化，为临床ANA检测提供了一种高效准确的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is a crucial method for diagnosing autoimmune disorders, including lupus, Sjögren's syndrome, and scleroderma. Despite its importance, manual ANA detection is slow, labor-intensive, and demands years of training. ANA detection is complicated by over 100 coexisting antibody types, resulting in vast fluorescent pattern combinations. Although machine learning and deep learning have enabled automation, ANA detection in real-world clinical settings presents unique challenges as it involves multi-instance, multi-label (MIML) learning. In this paper, a novel framework for ANA detection is proposed that handles the complexities of MIML tasks using unaltered microscope images without manual preprocessing. Inspired by human labeling logic, it identifies consistent ANA sub-regions and assigns aggregated labels accordingly. These steps are implemented using three task-specific components: an instance sampler, a probabilistic pseudo-label dispatcher, and self-paced weight learning rate coefficients. The instance sampler suppresses low-confidence instances by modeling pattern confidence, while the dispatcher adaptively assigns labels based on instance distinguishability. Self-paced learning adjusts training according to empirical label observations. Our framework overcomes limitations of traditional MIML methods and supports end-to-end optimization. Extensive experiments on one ANA dataset and three public medical MIML benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our framework. On the ANA dataset, our model achieves up to +7.0% F1-Macro and +12.6% mAP gains over the best prior method, setting new state-of-the-art results. It also ranks top-2 across all key metrics on public datasets, reducing Hamming loss and one-error by up to 18.2% and 26.9%, respectively.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have shown great promise in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, and similar efforts are now emerging in the Earth Observation community. These models aim to generalize across tasks with limited supervision, reducing the need for training separate models for each task. However, current strategies, which largely focus on scaling model size and dataset volume, require prohibitive computational and data resources, limiting accessibility to only a few large institutions. Moreover, this paradigm of ever-larger models stands in stark contrast with the principles of sustainable and environmentally responsible AI, as it leads to immense carbon footprints and resource inefficiency. In this work, we present a novel and efficient alternative: an Ensemble-of-Specialists framework for building Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs). Our method decomposes the training process into lightweight, task-specific ConvNeXtV2 specialists that can be frozen and reused. This modular approach offers strong advantages in efficiency, interpretability, and extensibility. Moreover, it naturally supports federated training, pruning, and continuous specialist integration, making it particularly well-suited for collaborative and resource-constrained settings. Our framework sets a new direction for building scalable and efficient RSFMs.

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is a debilitating disorder marked by a decline in cognitive function. Timely identification of the disease is essential for the development of personalized treatment strategies that aim to mitigate its progression. The application of generated images for the prediction of Alzheimer's disease poses challenges, particularly in accurately representing the disease's characteristics when input sequences are captured at irregular time intervals. This study presents an innovative methodology for sequential image generation, guided by quantitative metrics, to maintain the essential features indicative of disease progression. Furthermore, an age-scaling factor is integrated into the process to produce age-specific MRI images, facilitating the prediction of advanced stages of the disease. The results obtained from the ablation study suggest that the inclusion of quantitative metrics significantly improves the accuracy of MRI image synthesis. Furthermore, the application of age-scaled pixel loss contributed to the enhanced iterative generation of MRI images. In terms of long-term disease prognosis, the Structural Similarity Index reached a peak value of 0.882, indicating a substantial degree of similarity in the synthesized images.

Conclusion: 潜在空间奖励建模是视频生成中偏好优化的有效方法，PRFL框架在效率和效果上都优于RGB ReFL。

Abstract: Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.

Result: 创建了一个受控但真实的基准，提供跨光照条件的标准化评估协议。

Conclusion: UAVLight为开发在真实室外环境中一致、忠实且可重光照的重建方法提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Illumination inconsistency is a fundamental challenge in multi-view 3D reconstruction. Variations in sunlight direction, cloud cover, and shadows break the constant-lighting assumption underlying both classical multi-view stereo (MVS) and structure from motion (SfM) pipelines and recent neural rendering methods, leading to geometry drift, color inconsistency, and shadow imprinting. This issue is especially critical in UAV-based reconstruction, where long flight durations and outdoor environments make lighting changes unavoidable. However, existing datasets either restrict capture to short time windows, thus lacking meaningful illumination diversity, or span months and seasons, where geometric and semantic changes confound the isolated study of lighting robustness. We introduce UAVLight, a controlled-yet-real benchmark for illumination-robust 3D reconstruction. Each scene is captured along repeatable, geo-referenced flight paths at multiple fixed times of day, producing natural lighting variation under consistent geometry, calibration, and viewpoints. With standardized evaluation protocols across lighting conditions, UAVLight provides a reliable foundation for developing and benchmarking reconstruction methods that are consistent, faithful, and relightable in real outdoor environments.

Result: 在患者姿态变化的真实手术条件下评估地标检测精度。

Conclusion: 该框架能够提高在非标准视图下的地标检测准确性，适应实际手术中的姿态变化。

Abstract: Automated landmark detection offers an efficient approach for medical professionals to understand patient anatomic structure and positioning using intra-operative imaging. While current detection methods for pelvic fluoroscopy demonstrate promising accuracy, most assume a fixed Antero-Posterior view of the pelvis. However, orientation often deviates from this standard view, either due to repositioning of the imaging unit or of the target structure itself. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that incorporates 2D/3D landmark registration into the training of a U-Net landmark prediction model. We analyze the performance difference by comparing landmark detection accuracy between the baseline U-Net, U-Net trained with Pose Estimation Loss, and U-Net fine-tuned with Pose Estimation Loss under realistic intra-operative conditions where patient pose is variable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源模型在音频-视频同步生成中存在三个根本挑战：对应漂移、低效的全局注意力机制以及传统CFG的模态内偏见，这些问题阻碍了鲁棒的音频-视频对齐。

Method: 1. 跨任务协同训练：利用音频驱动视频和视频驱动音频生成任务的强监督信号来缓解漂移问题
2. 全局-局部解耦交互模块：实现高效精确的时序-风格对齐
3. 同步增强CFG：在推理过程中显式分离和放大对齐信号

Result: 大量实验表明，Harmony在生成保真度和细粒度音频-视频同步方面均显著优于现有方法，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Harmony框架通过机制性地强制音频-视频同步，有效解决了联合扩散过程中的根本挑战，为同步音频-视觉内容合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The synthesis of synchronized audio-visual content is a key challenge in generative AI, with open-source models facing challenges in robust audio-video alignment. Our analysis reveals that this issue is rooted in three fundamental challenges of the joint diffusion process: (1) Correspondence Drift, where concurrently evolving noisy latents impede stable learning of alignment; (2) inefficient global attention mechanisms that fail to capture fine-grained temporal cues; and (3) the intra-modal bias of conventional Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which enhances conditionality but not cross-modal synchronization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Harmony, a novel framework that mechanistically enforces audio-visual synchronization. We first propose a Cross-Task Synergy training paradigm to mitigate drift by leveraging strong supervisory signals from audio-driven video and video-driven audio generation tasks. Then, we design a Global-Local Decoupled Interaction Module for efficient and precise temporal-style alignment. Finally, we present a novel Synchronization-Enhanced CFG (SyncCFG) that explicitly isolates and amplifies the alignment signal during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Harmony establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in both generation fidelity and, critically, in achieving fine-grained audio-visual synchronization.

Motivation: 口腔癌在全球非常常见，但由于口腔内良性、癌前病变和恶性病变在视觉上相似，通常到晚期才被诊断。早期实施计算机辅助诊断系统可显著改善临床结果。

Method: 结合分层数据分割、高级数据增强和过采样技术来构建多分类器，以克服有限和不平衡数据集的挑战。

Result: 实验结果显示83.33%的准确率、89.12%的精确率和77.31%的召回率，优于现有最先进方法，在少数类分类方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 该框架展示了过采样和增强策略在数据不平衡情况下的有效性，是构建可信赖口腔癌早期检测计算机辅助诊断系统的第一步。

Abstract: Oral cancer is highly common across the globe and is mostly diagnosed during the later stages due to the close visual similarity to benign, precancerous, and malignant lesions in the oral cavity. Implementing computer aided diagnosis systems early on has the potential to greatly improve clinical outcomes. This research intends to use deep learning to build a multiclass classifier for sixteen different oral lesions. To overcome the challenges of limited and imbalanced datasets, the proposed technique combines stratified data splitting and advanced data augmentation and oversampling to perform the classification. The experimental results, which achieved 83.33 percent accuracy, 89.12 percent precision, and 77.31 percent recall, demonstrate the superiority of the suggested model over state of the art methods now in use. The suggested model effectively conveys the effectiveness of oversampling and augmentation strategies in situations where the minority class classification performance is noteworthy. As a first step toward trustworthy computer aided diagnostic systems for the early detection of oral cancer in clinical settings, the suggested framework shows promise.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoGAN是一个专注于提升视频生成运动真实性的后训练框架，通过光流判别器和分布匹配正则化器，在不牺牲视觉质量的前提下显著改善运动连贯性和动态效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型在帧级保真度上表现良好，但在运动连贯性、动态效果和真实性方面存在不足，常出现抖动、重影或不合逻辑的动态。标准的去噪MSE目标缺乏对时间一致性的直接监督。

Method: 基于3步蒸馏的视频扩散模型，训练基于DiT的光流判别器来区分真实与生成的运动，结合分布匹配正则化器以保持视觉保真度。

Result: 在VBench上，MoGAN比50步教师模型提升运动分数7.3%，比3步DMD模型提升13.3%；在VideoJAM-Bench上分别提升7.4%和8.8%，同时保持相当或更好的美学和图像质量分数。人类研究显示MoGAN在运动质量上更受青睐。

Conclusion: MoGAN在不牺牲视觉保真度或效率的前提下，显著提升了运动真实性，为快速高质量视频生成提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Video diffusion models achieve strong frame-level fidelity but still struggle with motion coherence, dynamics and realism, often producing jitter, ghosting, or implausible dynamics. A key limitation is that the standard denoising MSE objective provides no direct supervision on temporal consistency, allowing models to achieve low loss while still generating poor motion. We propose MoGAN, a motion-centric post-training framework that improves motion realism without reward models or human preference data. Built atop a 3-step distilled video diffusion model, we train a DiT-based optical-flow discriminator to differentiate real from generated motion, combined with a distribution-matching regularizer to preserve visual fidelity. With experiments on Wan2.1-T2V-1.3B, MoGAN substantially improves motion quality across benchmarks. On VBench, MoGAN boosts motion score by +7.3% over the 50-step teacher and +13.3% over the 3-step DMD model. On VideoJAM-Bench, MoGAN improves motion score by +7.4% over the teacher and +8.8% over DMD, while maintaining comparable or even better aesthetic and image-quality scores. A human study further confirms that MoGAN is preferred for motion quality (52% vs. 38% for the teacher; 56% vs. 29% for DMD). Overall, MoGAN delivers significantly more realistic motion without sacrificing visual fidelity or efficiency, offering a practical path toward fast, high-quality video generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自提示的点监督框架，通过Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环，仅使用稀疏点标注来适应SAM模型到遥感图像分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM模型在自然图像上表现优异，但在遥感图像上由于领域偏移和密集标注稀缺而表现不佳，需要一种仅用稀疏点标注的适应方法。

Method: 采用Refine-Requery-Reinforce循环：从初始点生成粗伪掩码（Refine），用自构建的框提示改进（Requery），并通过跨迭代嵌入对齐减少确认偏差（Reinforce）。

Result: 在WHU、HRSID和NWPU VHR-10三个遥感图像基准数据集上，该方法持续超越预训练SAM和最近的点监督分割方法。

Conclusion: 自提示和语义对齐为遥感应用中基础分割模型的可扩展点级适应提供了高效路径。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated remarkable generalization on natural images, but perform suboptimally on remote sensing imagery (RSI) due to severe domain shift and the scarcity of dense annotations. To address this, we propose a self-prompting, point-supervised framework that adapts SAM to RSIs using only sparse point annotations. Our method employs a Refine-Requery-Reinforce loop, where coarse pseudo-masks are generated from initial points (Refine), improved with self-constructed box prompts (Requery), and embeddings are aligned across iterations to reduce confirmation bias (Reinforce). Without relying on full-mask supervision, our approach progressively enhances SAM's segmentation quality and domain robustness through self-guided prompt adaptation . We evaluate our proposed method on three RSI benchmark datasets, including WHU, HRSID, and NWPU VHR-10, showing that our method consistently surpasses pretrained SAM and recent point-supervised segmentation methods. Our results demonstrate that self-prompting and semantic alignment provide an efficient path towards scalable, point-level adaptation of foundation segmentation models for remote sensing applications.

Motivation: 现有的图卷积网络在骨骼动作识别中依赖大量标注数据，但在实际应用中标注数据往往稀缺，需要开发标签高效的模型。

Method: 1) 开发新颖的采集函数，使用对抗策略选择信息丰富的代表性样本进行标注，平衡代表性、多样性和不确定性；2) 引入双向稳定GCN架构，改进环境空间和潜在数据空间之间的映射。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的骨骼动作识别基准测试上进行广泛评估，相比先前工作取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的标签高效GCN模型能够有效减少对标注数据的依赖，在骨骼动作识别任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in skeleton-based action recognition, their performance often depends on large volumes of labeled data, which are frequently scarce in practical settings. To address this limitation, we propose a novel label-efficient GCN model. Our work makes two primary contributions. First, we develop a novel acquisition function that employs an adversarial strategy to identify a compact set of informative exemplars for labeling. This selection process balances representativeness, diversity, and uncertainty. Second, we introduce bidirectional and stable GCN architectures. These enhanced networks facilitate a more effective mapping between the ambient and latent data spaces, enabling a better understanding of the learned exemplar distribution. Extensive evaluations on two challenging skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks reveal significant improvements achieved by our label-efficient GCNs compared to prior work.

TL;DR: CaFlow是一个用于长期动作质量评估的统一框架，结合了反事实去混淆和双向时间条件流，通过因果反事实正则化和双向流模块提升长期时间建模的鲁棒性和连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期动作质量评估（如花样滑冰、艺术体操）需要建模长时间动态并保持对上下文混淆因素的鲁棒性，现有方法依赖昂贵标注或单向时间建模，容易受到伪相关性和不稳定长期表示的影响。

Method: 提出CaFlow框架，包含因果反事实正则化（CCR）模块和双向流（BiT-Flow）模块。CCR以自监督方式解耦因果和混淆特征，通过反事实干预增强因果鲁棒性；BiT-Flow建模前向和后向动态，通过循环一致性约束产生更平滑连贯的表示。

Result: 在多个长期AQA基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CaFlow达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CaFlow通过整合反事实去混淆和双向时间条件流，有效解决了长期动作质量评估中的挑战，在多个基准测试上表现出色。

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) predicts fine-grained execution scores from action videos and is widely applied in sports, rehabilitation, and skill evaluation. Long-term AQA, as in figure skating or rhythmic gymnastics, is especially challenging since it requires modeling extended temporal dynamics while remaining robust to contextual confounders. Existing approaches either depend on costly annotations or rely on unidirectional temporal modeling, making them vulnerable to spurious correlations and unstable long-term representations. To this end, we propose CaFlow, a unified framework that integrates counterfactual de-confounding with bidirectional time-conditioned flow. The Causal Counterfactual Regularization (CCR) module disentangles causal and confounding features in a self-supervised manner and enforces causal robustness through counterfactual interventions, while the BiT-Flow module models forward and backward dynamics with a cycle-consistency constraint to produce smoother and more coherent representations. Extensive experiments on multiple long-term AQA benchmarks demonstrate that CaFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/Harrison21/CaFlow

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型越来越多地被用作多模态评估系统的评判者，但它们遵循多样化细粒度评估标准的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 通过严格的数据筛选流程构建Multi-Crit基准，收集具有多标准人工标注的挑战性响应对，并引入三个新指标来系统评估标准遵循能力。

Result: 对25个LMMs的综合分析显示：专有模型在遵循多样化标准方面仍有困难；开源模型在灵活遵循标准方面更落后；基于整体判断信号的批评微调无法泛化到标准级判断。

Conclusion: Multi-Crit为构建可靠和可引导的多模态AI评估奠定了基础，揭示了当前多模态评判者的局限性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) are increasingly adopted as judges in multimodal evaluation systems due to their strong instruction following and consistency with human preferences. However, their ability to follow diverse, fine-grained evaluation criteria remains underexplored. We develop Multi-Crit, a benchmark for evaluating multimodal judges on their capacity to follow pluralistic criteria and produce reliable criterion-level judgments. Covering both open-ended generation and verifiable reasoning tasks, Multi-Crit is built through a rigorous data curation pipeline that gathers challenging response pairs with multi-criterion human annotations. It further introduces three novel metrics for systematically assessing pluralistic adherence, criterion-switching flexibility, and the ability to recognize criterion-level preference conflicts. Comprehensive analysis of 25 LMMs reveals that 1) proprietary models still struggle to maintain consistent adherence to pluralistic criteria--especially in open-ended evaluation; 2) open-source models lag further behind in flexibly following diverse criteria; and 3) critic fine-tuning with holistic judgment signals enhances visual grounding but fails to generalize to pluralistic criterion-level judgment. Additional analyses on reasoning fine-tuning, test-time scaling, and boundary consistency between open-source and proprietary models further probe the limits of current multimodal judges. As a pioneering study, Multi-Crit lays the foundation for building reliable and steerable multimodal AI evaluation.

Motivation: 胶质瘤是具有高死亡率的脑肿瘤类型，早期准确诊断对于治疗干预至关重要。传统方法在处理高维3D MRI数据和捕捉临床相关特征方面存在局限性。

Method: 开发混合深度学习框架：U-Net分割模型用于精确肿瘤分割，结合DenseNet-VGG分类网络，集成多头注意力和空间通道注意力机制，通过预处理步骤（归一化、重采样、数据增强）处理3D MRI数据。

Result: 该框架在肿瘤分割方面达到98%的Dice系数，分类准确率达到99%，优于传统CNN模型和无注意力方法，注意力机制增强了临床相关特征的优先级和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架在促进胶质瘤及时可靠诊断和分级方面具有巨大潜力，有助于改善患者治疗规划，展示了深度学习在医学影像分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Gliomas are brain tumor types that have a high mortality rate which means early and accurate diagnosis is important for therapeutic intervention for the tumors. To address this difficulty, the proposed research will develop a hybrid deep learning model which integrates U-Net based segmentation and a hybrid DenseNet-VGG classification network with multihead attention and spatial-channel attention capabilities. The segmentation model will precisely demarcate the tumors in a 3D volume of MRI data guided by spatial and contextual information. The classification network which combines a branch of both DenseNet and VGG, will incorporate the demarcated tumor on which features with attention mechanisms would be focused on clinically relevant features. High-dimensional 3D MRI data could successfully be utilized in the model through preprocessing steps which are normalization, resampling, and data augmentation. Through a variety of measures the framework is evaluated: measures of performance in segmentation are Dice coefficient and Mean Intersection over Union (IoU) and measures of performance in classification are accuracy precision, recall, and F1-score. The hybrid framework that has been proposed has demonstrated through physical testing that it has the capability of obtaining a Dice coefficient of 98% in tumor segmentation, and 99% on classification accuracy, outperforming traditional CNN models and attention-free methods. Utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms enhances notions of priority in aspects of the tumor that are clinically significant, and enhances interpretability and accuracy. The results suggest a great potential of the framework in facilitating the timely and reliable diagnosis and grading of glioma by clinicians is promising, allowing for better planning of patient treatment.

Motivation: 探索仅凭相机运动轨迹（而非视觉像素）是否能理解视频内容，验证"如何移动"是否能揭示"在做什么"或"观察什么"。

Method: 提出对比学习框架训练CamFormer编码器，将相机姿态轨迹投影到与自然语言对齐的联合嵌入空间。

Result: 相机轨迹是揭示视频内容的有效信号，CamFormer嵌入在跨模态对齐、分类和时序分析等下游任务中表现优异，且对不同相机姿态估计方法具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 相机轨迹是一种轻量、鲁棒且多功能的感知视频内容的模态。

Abstract: Can one perceive a video's content without seeing its pixels, just from the camera trajectory-the path it carves through space? This paper is the first to systematically investigate this seemingly implausible question. Towards this end, we propose a contrastive learning framework to train CamFormer, a dedicated encoder that projects camera pose trajectories into a joint embedding space, aligning them with natural language. We find that, contrary to its apparent simplicity, the camera trajectory is a remarkably informative signal to uncover video content. In other words, "how you move" can indeed reveal "what you are doing" (egocentric) or "observing" (exocentric). We demonstrate the versatility of our learned CamFormer embeddings on a diverse suite of downstream tasks, ranging from cross-modal alignment to classification and temporal analysis. Importantly, our representations are robust across diverse camera pose estimation methods, including both high-fidelity multi-sensored and standard RGB-only estimators. Our findings establish camera trajectory as a lightweight, robust, and versatile modality for perceiving video content.

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在生成高质量多样化图像方面表现出色，但在处理高保真度的组合和多模态控制方面仍存在困难，特别是当用户同时指定多种控制信号时。

Method: 将多样控制信号编码为单一复合画布图像，采用多任务画布训练策略优化扩散模型，使其能够联合理解和整合异构控制信号。

Conclusion: Canvas-to-Image通过统一的学习范式实现了跨多个控制模态的推理，在身份保持和控制遵循方面表现出色，并能很好地泛化到多控制场景。

Abstract: While modern diffusion models excel at generating high-quality and diverse images, they still struggle with high-fidelity compositional and multimodal control, particularly when users simultaneously specify text prompts, subject references, spatial arrangements, pose constraints, and layout annotations. We introduce Canvas-to-Image, a unified framework that consolidates these heterogeneous controls into a single canvas interface, enabling users to generate images that faithfully reflect their intent. Our key idea is to encode diverse control signals into a single composite canvas image that the model can directly interpret for integrated visual-spatial reasoning. We further curate a suite of multi-task datasets and propose a Multi-Task Canvas Training strategy that optimizes the diffusion model to jointly understand and integrate heterogeneous controls into text-to-image generation within a unified learning paradigm. This joint training enables Canvas-to-Image to reason across multiple control modalities rather than relying on task-specific heuristics, and it generalizes well to multi-control scenarios during inference. Extensive experiments show that Canvas-to-Image significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity preservation and control adherence across challenging benchmarks, including multi-person composition, pose-controlled composition, layout-constrained generation, and multi-control generation.

TL;DR: 论文主张重新定义LLM效率，从追求大规模复杂技术转向关注资源受限环境下的轻量级解决方案，以促进AI技术的民主化部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流LLM效率技术（如MoE、推测解码、复杂RAG）主要服务于大型科技公司，导致中小型组织无法受益，加剧了技术不平等和碳浪费问题。

Method: 提出新的研究议程：无需重新训练即可改造预训练模型架构、轻量级微调保持对齐、经济化长推理链、动态知识管理替代重型RAG管道，并采用开销感知效率作为标准基准。

Result: 通过重新定义效率概念，将采用成本、可持续性和公平性纳入考量，为资源有限的组织提供可行的LLM部署方案。

Conclusion: 效率优化的目标应该是减少不平等和碳浪费，而非加剧这些问题，从而实现LLM技术的真正民主化部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become indispensable, but the most celebrated efficiency methods -- mixture-of-experts (MoE), speculative decoding, and complex retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) -- were built for hyperscale providers with vast infrastructure and elite teams. Outside that context, their benefits collapse into overhead, fragility, and wasted carbon. The result is that a handful of Big Tech companies benefit, while thousands of hospitals, schools, governments, and enterprises are left without viable options. We argue that the next frontier is not greater sophistication at scale, but robust simplicity: efficiency that thrives under modest resources and minimal expertise. We propose a new research agenda: retrofitting pretrained models with more efficient architectures without retraining, inventing lightweight fine-tuning that preserves alignment, making reasoning economical despite long chains of thought, enabling dynamic knowledge management without heavy RAG pipelines, and adopting Overhead-Aware Efficiency (OAE) as a standard benchmark. By redefining efficiency to include adoption cost, sustainability, and fairness, we can democratize LLM deployment -- ensuring that optimization reduces inequality and carbon waste rather than amplifying them.

Conclusion: 有意义的语义关系可以从确定性几何中涌现，HTP为数据驱动嵌入提供了透明高效的替代方案，证明了无需训练即可获得语义表示的可能性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Harmonic Token Projection (HTP), a reversible and deterministic framework for generating text embeddings without training, vocabularies, or stochastic parameters. Unlike neural embeddings that rely on statistical co-occurrence or optimization, HTP encodes each token analytically as a harmonic trajectory derived from its Unicode integer representation, establishing a bijective and interpretable mapping between discrete symbols and continuous vector space. The harmonic formulation provides phase-coherent projections that preserve both structure and reversibility, enabling semantic similarity estimation from purely geometric alignment. Experimental evaluation on the Semantic Textual Similarity Benchmark (STS-B) and its multilingual extension shows that HTP achieves a Spearman correlation of \r{ho} = 0.68 in English, maintaining stable performance across ten languages with negligible computational cost and sub-millisecond latency per sentence pair. This demonstrates that meaningful semantic relations can emerge from deterministic geometry, offering a transparent and efficient alternative to data-driven embeddings. Keywords: Harmonic Token Projection, reversible embedding, deterministic encoding, semantic similarity, multilingual representation.

Abstract: Text classification with hierarchical taxonomies is a fundamental requirement in IT Service Management (ITSM) systems, where support tickets must be categorized into tree-structured taxonomies. We present a dual-embedding centroid-based classification framework that maintains separate semantic and lexical centroid representations per category, combining them through reciprocal rank fusion at inference time. The framework achieves performance competitive with Support Vector Machines (hierarchical F1: 0.731 vs 0.727) while providing interpretability through centroid representations. Evaluated on 8,968 ITSM tickets across 123 categories, this method achieves 5.9 times faster training and up to 152 times faster incremental updates. With 8.6-8.8 times speedup across batch sizes (100-1000 samples) when excluding embedding computation. These results make the method suitable for production ITSM environments prioritizing interpretability and operational efficiency.

Abstract: Reward models are crucial for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences but face two representative challenges. First, traditional discriminative reward models usually concatenate questions and responses directly as input, resulting in low data efficiency. Second, reward models are vulnerable to reward overoptimization. We propose PIRA, a training paradigm addressing these issues through three strategies: (1) Reformulating question-answer pairs into preference-based instructions for clearer and more explicit task specification, (2) aggregating rewards from diverse preference tasks to reduce bias and improve robustness, and (3) averaging value-head outputs under varying dropout rates to stabilize rewards. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of PIRA.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何通过重组法律文档结构、定义修辞角色和模拟法庭推理步骤来提升大语言模型在法律任务中的表现，在零样本设置下实现了1.5%-4.36%的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备通用推理能力，但在法律等专业领域表现不佳，主要因为缺乏领域特定的预训练，且法律文档通常冗长复杂，模型难以有效处理全文。

Method: 通过三个实验：(i)基于修辞角色重组文档结构评估信息组织对长文本处理的影响；(ii)定义修辞角色让模型熟悉法律术语；(iii)模拟法庭对修辞角色的逐步推理过程来增强模型推理能力。

Result: 在三个印度法律判决预测数据集上的零样本实验显示，重组数据或解释关键法律术语能显著提升模型性能，F1分数相比基线最少提升约1.5%，最高提升4.36%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化信息组织和领域术语解释，可以有效提升大语言模型在法律任务中的表现，即使在没有领域特定预训练的情况下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets from the web, exhibit remarkable general reasoning skills. Despite this, they often struggle in specialized areas like law, mainly because they lack domain-specific pretraining. The legal field presents unique challenges, as legal documents are generally long and intricate, making it hard for models to process the full text efficiently. Previous studies have examined in-context approaches to address the knowledge gap, boosting model performance in new domains without full domain alignment. In our paper, we analyze model behavior on legal tasks by conducting experiments in three areas: (i) reorganizing documents based on rhetorical roles to assess how structured information affects long context processing and model decisions, (ii) defining rhetorical roles to familiarize the model with legal terminology, and (iii) emulating the step-by-step reasoning of courts regarding rhetorical roles to enhance model reasoning. These experiments are conducted in a zero-shot setting across three Indian legal judgment prediction datasets. Our results reveal that organizing data or explaining key legal terms significantly boosts model performance, with a minimum increase of ~1.5% and a maximum improvement of 4.36% in F1 score compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出了新的心理健康基准数据集MindSET，包含1300万条标注帖子，覆盖7种心理健康状况，通过严格预处理确保数据质量，在诊断检测任务中表现优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理健康分析基准数据集已过时，存在数据量有限、清洗不足、内容多样性等问题，需要新的高质量数据集来支持社交媒体心理健康研究。

Method: 从Reddit收集自报告诊断数据，应用严格预处理（语言过滤、NSFW内容移除、去重），使用LIWC进行语言分析，并基于微调语言模型和词袋特征进行二元分类实验。

Result: MindSET数据集包含1300万标注帖子，是之前基准的两倍多；在诊断检测任务中，模型在MindSET上训练比在现有基准上表现更好，自闭症检测F1分数提升18个百分点。

Conclusion: MindSET为社交媒体与心理健康交叉研究提供了坚实基础，支持早期风险检测和新兴心理趋势的深入分析。

Abstract: Social media data has become a vital resource for studying mental health, offering real-time insights into thoughts, emotions, and behaviors that traditional methods often miss. Progress in this area has been facilitated by benchmark datasets for mental health analysis; however, most existing benchmarks have become outdated due to limited data availability, inadequate cleaning, and the inherently diverse nature of social media content (e.g., multilingual and harmful material). We present a new benchmark dataset, \textbf{MindSET}, curated from Reddit using self-reported diagnoses to address these limitations. The annotated dataset contains over \textbf{13M} annotated posts across seven mental health conditions, more than twice the size of previous benchmarks. To ensure data quality, we applied rigorous preprocessing steps, including language filtering, and removal of Not Safe for Work (NSFW) and duplicate content. We further performed a linguistic analysis using LIWC to examine psychological term frequencies across the eight groups represented in the dataset. To demonstrate the dataset utility, we conducted binary classification experiments for diagnosis detection using both fine-tuned language models and Bag-of-Words (BoW) features. Models trained on MindSET consistently outperformed those trained on previous benchmarks, achieving up to an \textbf{18-point} improvement in F1 for Autism detection. Overall, MindSET provides a robust foundation for researchers exploring the intersection of social media and mental health, supporting both early risk detection and deeper analysis of emerging psychological trends.

TL;DR: FlexCode是一个基于流行度感知的生成式推荐框架，通过动态分配协同过滤和语义编码本的固定token预算，解决了传统方法使用单一编码本无法平衡热门物品和长尾物品表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法使用单一编码本表示所有物品，忽视了热门物品（富含协同信号）和长尾物品（依赖语义理解）之间的内在不平衡性，这种统一处理限制了表示效率并阻碍了泛化能力。

Method: 引入FlexCode框架，自适应地在协同过滤编码本和语义编码本之间分配固定token预算；使用轻量级MoE动态平衡CF特定精度和语义泛化；通过对齐和平滑目标保持流行度谱系的一致性。

Result: 在公共和工业规模数据集上的实验表明，FlexCode始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexCode为生成式推荐器中的token表示提供了新机制，实现了更强的准确性和尾部鲁棒性，为基于token的推荐模型中平衡记忆和泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数文本到SQL研究和数据集都集中在英语和中文，阿拉伯语领域尚无相关工作。本文旨在填补这一空白，使不懂SQL的用户能够用阿拉伯语与数据库进行对话。

Method: 构建Ar-SParC数据集，使用GPT-3.5-turbo和GPT-4.5-turbo进行40个实验，应用10种提示工程技术，并开发了GAT校正器方法来提升性能。

Result: GAT校正器在所有40个实验中均提升了性能，零样本设置下执行准确率(EX)和交互准确率(IX)平均提升1.9%，上下文学习设置下EX提升1.72%、IX提升0.92%。

Conclusion: 成功创建了首个阿拉伯语文本到SQL数据集，并证明了GAT校正器方法的有效性，为阿拉伯语自然语言数据库交互提供了基础。

Abstract: In recent years, the task of cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL has received significant attention. Enables users with no prior knowledge of SQL to have a conversation with databases using natural language. However, most of the available datasets and research have been conducted in English, along with some work in Chinese. To this date, no effort has been made to address this task in the Arabic language. In this paper, we introduce Ar-SParC, the first Arabic cross-domain, context-dependent text-to-SQL dataset. The dataset consists of 3,450 sequences of interrelated questions, each sequence containing an average of approximately three questions, which results in a total of 10225 questions along with their corresponding SQL queries. We conducted 40 experiments on the Ar-SParC dataset using two large language models, GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4.5-turbo, applying 10 different prompt engineering techniques, including four question representation methods and six in-context learning techniques. Furthermore, we developed a novel approach named GAT corrector, which enhanced the performance across all 40 experiments, yielding an average improvement of 1.9% in execution accuracy (EX) and 1.9% in interaction accuracy (IX) under zero-shot settings, and an average increase of 1.72% EX and 0.92% IX under in-context learning settings. Finally, we conducted an ablation study with two more experiments to explain why the GAT corrector outperformed the previous GAT verifier technique, particularly for the Arabic language.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个分层分类法来评估大型语言模型在肿瘤学决策支持中的推理错误，发现GPT-4在23%的病例中出现推理错误，这些错误与临床指南不一致且可能有害的建议相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在临床基准测试中表现良好，但它们可能通过错误的推理得出正确结论，这种失败模式在肿瘤学决策支持中具有安全影响，且无法通过基于准确性的评估来捕捉。

Method: 使用CORAL数据集的乳腺癌和胰腺癌病历，注释了600个推理轨迹来定义三层分类法，将计算失败映射到认知偏差框架。在822个前列腺癌咨询记录中验证了该分类法，模拟提取、分析和临床建议任务。

Result: 推理错误发生在23%的解释中，并主导了总体错误，确认偏差和锚定偏差最为常见。推理失败与指南不一致且可能有害的建议相关，特别是在晚期疾病管理中。自动化评估器可以检测错误存在但无法可靠分类子类型。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在推理存在缺陷时可能提供流畅但临床不安全的建议。该分类法为临床部署前评估和改进推理保真度提供了一个可推广的框架。

Abstract: Despite high performance on clinical benchmarks, large language models may reach correct conclusions through faulty reasoning, a failure mode with safety implications for oncology decision support that is not captured by accuracy-based evaluation. In this two-cohort retrospective study, we developed a hierarchical taxonomy of reasoning errors from GPT-4 chain-of-thought responses to real oncology notes and tested its clinical relevance. Using breast and pancreatic cancer notes from the CORAL dataset, we annotated 600 reasoning traces to define a three-tier taxonomy mapping computational failures to cognitive bias frameworks. We validated the taxonomy on 822 responses from prostate cancer consult notes spanning localized through metastatic disease, simulating extraction, analysis, and clinical recommendation tasks. Reasoning errors occurred in 23 percent of interpretations and dominated overall errors, with confirmation bias and anchoring bias most common. Reasoning failures were associated with guideline-discordant and potentially harmful recommendations, particularly in advanced disease management. Automated evaluators using state-of-the-art language models detected error presence but could not reliably classify subtypes. These findings show that large language models may provide fluent but clinically unsafe recommendations when reasoning is flawed. The taxonomy provides a generalizable framework for evaluating and improving reasoning fidelity before clinical deployment.

*Bharadwaj Yadavalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态模板选择(DTS)方法，根据查询复杂度自适应选择响应模板，在保持响应质量的同时显著降低令牌成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型部署采用统一的提示策略，对复杂分析任务和简单事实问题都使用冗长的响应模式，导致令牌效率低下。由于输出令牌成本比输入令牌高4-8倍，这种一刀切的方法造成了显著的成本浪费。

Method: 开发了动态模板选择(DTS)系统，比较了两种路由方法：使用预计算嵌入的简单MLP和微调的RoBERTa变换器。通过MLP路由在MMLU问题集上实现90.5%的路由准确率。

Result: MLP路由在测试数据上达到90.5%的路由准确率，略优于RoBERTa(89.5%)，且参数量减少1.25亿。在三个主要LLM提供商(OpenAI GPT-4、Google Gemini、Anthropic Claude)上验证，路由准确率一致为90.5%，令牌减少量在32.6%-33.9%之间。

Conclusion: 动态模板选择方法能有效降低令牌成本而不影响响应质量，展示了跨提供商的路由泛化能力，为优化LLM部署成本提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Contemporary large language model deployments typically employ uniform prompting strategies across diverse query types, applying verbose response patterns to both complex analytical tasks and straightforward factual questions. This one-size-fits-all methodology leads to substantial token inefficiency, a concern amplified by the significant cost differential between input and output tokens--the latter commanding 4-8x higher prices across major providers. We present Dynamic Template Selection (DTS), which adaptively matches response templates to query complexity, achieving significant cost reductions without compromising response quality.
  We compared two routing approaches: a simple MLP that uses pre-computed embeddings and a more complex fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer. Through comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 MMLU questions, we find that the MLP router achieves 90.5% routing accuracy on held-out test data, marginally exceeding RoBERTa's performance (89.5%) despite utilizing 125M fewer parameters. Notably, our empirical analysis reveals provider-agnostic behavior in template selection--routing decisions generalize effectively across 3 major LLM providers (OpenAI GPT-4, Google Gemini, and Anthropic Claude), as validated through 9,000 production API calls. While routing accuracy remains consistent at 90.5% across providers, observed token reductions vary from 32.6% to 33.9%, reflecting provider-specific generation characteristics.
  This work contributes several key elements: formal problem formulation with theoretical grounding in machine learning, four algorithms with corresponding complexity analyses, and extensive empirical validation across production systems.

Conclusion: 多前缀记忆框架提供了更全面可靠的记忆评估方法，能有效识别LLM中的训练数据记忆，有助于解决隐私和版权问题。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on massive corpora, are prone to verbatim memorization of training data, creating significant privacy and copyright risks. While previous works have proposed various definitions for memorization, many exhibit shortcomings in comprehensively capturing this phenomenon, especially in aligned models. To address this, we introduce a novel framework: multi-prefix memorization. Our core insight is that memorized sequences are deeply encoded and thus retrievable via a significantly larger number of distinct prefixes than non-memorized content. We formalize this by defining a sequence as memorized if an external adversarial search can identify a target count of distinct prefixes that elicit it. This framework shifts the focus from single-path extraction to quantifying the robustness of a memory, measured by the diversity of its retrieval paths. Through experiments on open-source and aligned chat models, we demonstrate that our multi-prefix definition reliably distinguishes memorized from non-memorized data, providing a robust and practical tool for auditing data leakage in LLMs.

Conclusion: SAGE通过将特征解释重构为主动的、基于实验验证的过程，有效提高了稀疏自编码器特征解释的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque, posing a significant challenge to their safe and reliable deployment. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for decomposing LLM representations into more interpretable features, but explaining the features captured by SAEs remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose SAGE (SAE AGentic Explainer), an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanation-driven process. SAGE implements a rigorous methodology by systematically formulating multiple explanations for each feature, designing targeted experiments to test them, and iteratively refining explanations based on empirical activation feedback. Experiments on features from SAEs of diverse language models demonstrate that SAGE produces explanations with significantly higher generative and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art baselines.an agent-based framework that recasts feature interpretation from a passive, single-pass generation task into an active, explanationdriven process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了DSPy+HELM框架，通过结构化提示方法（特别是推理提示）来更准确地评估语言模型性能，发现传统HELM基准测试会低估模型性能4%，导致排名错误，而引入推理可以降低对提示设计的敏感性。

Motivation: 现有基准测试框架（如HELM）使用固定提示，无法跨模型泛化，导致性能估计不准确。需要估计每个语言模型的上限性能，避免低估。

Method: 开发了可复现的DSPy+HELM框架，使用四种提示方法在七个基准测试（通用/医学领域）上评估四个前沿语言模型，并与现有HELM基线比较。

Result: 发现：1）HELM低估LM性能4%；2）性能估计在不同基准间变化更大；3）3/7基准的排行榜排名翻转；4）引入推理（思维链）降低对提示设计的敏感性。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模实证研究，表明可扩展的性能上限估计能够创建更有决策价值的基准测试，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: As language models (LMs) are increasingly adopted across domains, high-quality benchmarking frameworks that accurately estimate performance are essential for guiding deployment decisions. While frameworks such as Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) enable broad evaluation across tasks, they often rely on fixed prompts that fail to generalize across LMs, yielding unrepresentative performance estimates. Unless we estimate each LM's ceiling (maximum achievable via changes to the prompt), we risk underestimating performance. Declarative prompting frameworks, such as DSPy, offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering by crafting structured prompts that can be optimized per task. However, such frameworks have not been systematically evaluated across established benchmarks. We present a reproducible DSPy+HELM framework that introduces structured prompting methods which elicit reasoning, enabling more accurate LM benchmarking. Using four prompting methods, we evaluate four frontier LMs across seven benchmarks (general/medical domain) against existing HELM baseline scores. We find that without structured prompting: (i) HELM underestimates LM performance (by 4% average), (ii) performance estimates vary more across benchmarks (+2% standard deviation), (iii) performance gaps are misrepresented (leaderboard rankings flip on 3/7 benchmarks), and (iv) introducing reasoning (chain-of-thought) reduces LM sensitivity to prompt design (smaller Δ across prompts). To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale benchmarking study to empirically characterize LM behavior across benchmarks and prompting methods, showing that scalable performance ceiling estimation enables more decision-useful benchmarks. We open-source (i) DSPy+HELM Integration (https://github.com/stanford-crfm/helm/pull/3893) and (ii) Prompt Optimization Pipeline (https://github.com/StanfordMIMI/dspy-helm).

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Length-MAX分词器，通过最小化平均字符数来减少训练和推理时的token数量，相比BPE在10K-50K词汇量下减少14-18%的token，在GPT-2模型上减少17-18%的训练步骤和13-14%的推理延迟，同时提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词器如BPE主要基于频率优化，但未充分考虑token长度对效率的影响。本文旨在通过优化平均token长度来提高语言模型的训练和推理效率。

Method: 将长度加权目标最大化建模为图划分问题，并开发贪心近似算法来获得词汇表，从而最小化平均字符数。

Result: 在FineWeb和多样化领域上，相比BPE减少14-18%的token；GPT-2模型训练步骤减少17-18%，推理延迟降低13-14%，吞吐量提升16%；下游任务中LAMBADA困惑度降低11.7%，HellaSwag准确率提升4.3%。

Conclusion: 优化平均token长度而非仅频率，是实现更高效语言建模的有效方法，在不牺牲性能的情况下显著提升效率，且与生产系统兼容。

Abstract: We introduce a new tokenizer for language models that minimizes the average tokens per character, thereby reducing the number of tokens needed to represent text during training and to generate text during inference. Our method, which we refer to as the Length-MAX tokenizer, obtains its vocabulary by casting a length-weighted objective maximization as a graph partitioning problem and developing a greedy approximation algorithm. On FineWeb and diverse domains, it yields 14--18\% fewer tokens than Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) across vocabulary sizes from 10K to 50K, and the reduction is 13.0\% when the size is 64K. Training GPT-2 models at 124M, 355M, and 1.3B parameters from scratch with five runs each shows 18.5\%, 17.2\%, and 18.5\% fewer steps, respectively, to reach a fixed validation loss, and 13.7\%, 12.7\%, and 13.7\% lower inference latency, together with a 16\% throughput gain at 124M, while consistently improving on downstream tasks including reducing LAMBADA perplexity by 11.7\% and enhancing HellaSwag accuracy by 4.3\%. Moreover, the Length-MAX tokenizer achieves 99.62\% vocabulary coverage and the out-of-vocabulary rate remains low at 0.12\% on test sets. These results demonstrate that optimizing for average token length, rather than frequency alone, offers an effective approach to more efficient language modeling without sacrificing -- and often improving -- downstream performance. The tokenizer is compatible with production systems and reduces embedding and KV-cache memory by 18\% at inference.

Abstract: Statefulness is essential for large language model (LLM) agents to perform long-term planning and problem-solving. This makes memory a critical component, yet its management and evolution remain largely underexplored. Existing evaluations mostly focus on static conversational settings, where memory is passively retrieved from dialogue to answer queries, overlooking the dynamic ability to accumulate and reuse experience across evolving task streams. In real-world environments such as interactive problem assistants or embodied agents, LLMs are required to handle continuous task streams, yet often fail to learn from accumulated interactions, losing valuable contextual insights, a limitation that calls for test-time evolution, where LLMs retrieve, integrate, and update memory continuously during deployment. To bridge this gap, we introduce Evo-Memory, a comprehensive streaming benchmark and framework for evaluating self-evolving memory in LLM agents. Evo-Memory structures datasets into sequential task streams, requiring LLMs to search, adapt, and evolve memory after each interaction. We unify and implement over ten representative memory modules and evaluate them across 10 diverse multi-turn goal-oriented and single-turn reasoning and QA datasets. To better benchmark experience reuse, we provide a baseline method, ExpRAG, for retrieving and utilizing prior experience, and further propose ReMem, an action-think-memory refine pipeline that tightly integrates reasoning, task actions, and memory updates to achieve continual improvement.

Abstract: Argument mining is a subfield of natural language processing to identify and extract the argument components, like premises and conclusions, within a text and to recognize the relations between them. It reveals the logical structure of texts to be used in tasks like knowledge extraction. This paper aims at utilizing a cross-lingual approach to argument mining for low-resource languages, by constructing three training scenarios. We examine the models on English, as a high-resource language, and Persian, as a low-resource language. To this end, we evaluate the models based on the English Microtext corpus \citep{PeldszusStede2015}, and its parallel Persian translation. The learning scenarios are as follow: (i) zero-shot transfer, where the model is trained solely with the English data, (ii) English-only training enhanced by synthetic examples generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), and (iii) a cross-lingual model that combines the original English data with manually translated Persian sentences. The zero-shot transfer model attains F1 scores of 50.2\% on the English test set and 50.7\% on the Persian test set. LLM-based augmentation model improves the performance up to 59.2\% on English and 69.3\% on Persian. The cross-lingual model, trained on both languages but evaluated solely on the Persian test set, surpasses the LLM-based variant, by achieving a F1 of 74.8\%. Results indicate that a lightweight cross-lingual blend can outperform considerably the more resource-intensive augmentation pipelines, and it offers a practical pathway for the argument mining task to overcome data resource shortage on low-resource languages.

*Nura Aljaafari,Danilo S. Carvalho,André Freitas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，研究LLMs如何实现语义角色，发现LLMs形成紧凑的、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间存在部分迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型显示出语义能力，但其内部实现抽象语义结构的机制仍不够清晰，需要更深入地表征这些内部机制。

Method: 整合角色交叉最小对、时间涌现分析和跨模型比较的方法，研究LLMs实现语义角色的机制。

Result: 发现：(i)高度集中的电路(89-94%归因在28个节点内)；(ii)渐进的结构细化而非相变，较大模型有时绕过局部化电路；(iii)中等的跨尺度守恒(24-59%组件重叠)和高光谱相似性。

Conclusion: LLMs形成紧凑、因果隔离的抽象语义结构机制，这些机制在不同规模和架构间表现出部分迁移性。

Abstract: Despite displaying semantic competence, large language models' internal mechanisms that ground abstract semantic structure remain insufficiently characterised. We propose a method integrating role-cross minimal pairs, temporal emergence analysis, and cross-model comparison to study how LLMs implement semantic roles. Our analysis uncovers: (i) highly concentrated circuits (89-94% attribution within 28 nodes); (ii) gradual structural refinement rather than phase transitions, with larger models sometimes bypassing localised circuits; and (iii) moderate cross-scale conservation (24-59% component overlap) alongside high spectral similarity. These findings suggest that LLMs form compact, causally isolated mechanisms for abstract semantic structure, and these mechanisms exhibit partial transfer across scales and architectures.

TL;DR: Chatty-KG是一个用于知识图谱对话问答的多智能体系统，结合了RAG式检索和结构化SPARQL查询执行，在单轮和多轮对话中都显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有KGQA系统在多轮对话中上下文跟踪困难、延迟高的问题，以及RAG系统在序列化图结构时的局限性，实现自然对话与结构化知识图谱的可靠结合。

Method: 采用模块化多智能体架构，通过专门任务LLM智能体协作进行上下文解释、对话跟踪、实体关系链接和高效查询规划，将自然语言问题翻译为可执行的SPARQL查询。

Result: 在多样化的知识图谱上实验表明，Chatty-KG在单轮和多轮设置下都显著优于现有最优基线，获得了更高的F1和P@1分数，且具有低延迟特性。

Conclusion: Chatty-KG统一了对话灵活性与结构化知识图谱基础，为可靠的多轮KGQA提供了可扩展和可扩展的方法，支持不断演化的知识图谱而无需微调或预处理。

Abstract: Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs (KGs) combines the factual grounding of KG-based QA with the interactive nature of dialogue systems. KGs are widely used in enterprise and domain applications to provide structured, evolving, and reliable knowledge. Large language models (LLMs) enable natural and context-aware conversations, but lack direct access to private and dynamic KGs. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems can retrieve graph content but often serialize structure, struggle with multi-turn context, and require heavy indexing. Traditional KGQA systems preserve structure but typically support only single-turn QA, incur high latency, and struggle with coreference and context tracking. To address these limitations, we propose Chatty-KG, a modular multi-agent system for conversational QA over KGs. Chatty-KG combines RAG-style retrieval with structured execution by generating SPARQL queries through task-specialized LLM agents. These agents collaborate for contextual interpretation, dialogue tracking, entity and relation linking, and efficient query planning, enabling accurate and low-latency translation of natural questions into executable queries. Experiments on large and diverse KGs show that Chatty-KG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both single-turn and multi-turn settings, achieving higher F1 and P@1 scores. Its modular design preserves dialogue coherence and supports evolving KGs without fine-tuning or pre-processing. Evaluations with commercial (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0) and open-weight (e.g., Phi-4, Gemma 3) LLMs confirm broad compatibility and stable performance. Overall, Chatty-KG unifies conversational flexibility with structured KG grounding, offering a scalable and extensible approach for reliable multi-turn KGQA.

TL;DR: LLMs在定义类问题上表现最佳，但在举例说明类问题上表现最差。研究发现LLMs倾向于对流行知识进行释义，而对技术性知识处理较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在回答定义类问题时表现高效，但在处理其他类型查询（如举例、释义）时性能下降，需要评估这种性能差异及其与预训练数据的关系。

Method: 使用TrackList分析管道和RefoMed-EN数据集（6170个医学术语及其定义、命名、举例、解释或释义），通过句法语义相似度、统计相关性和嵌入评估LLM输出质量。

Result: LLMs在定义类问题上的任务性能最高，在举例说明类问题上最低。对于定义类问题，LLMs更倾向于对流行知识进行释义，对技术性知识处理较少，特别是在专业文本中。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理不同类型查询时存在显著性能差异，对流行知识的处理优于技术性知识，这反映了预训练数据对模型能力的影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have proven efficient in giving definition-type answers to user input queries. While for humans giving various types of answers, such as examples and paraphrases, is an easy task, LLMs struggle to provide correct answers for other than definition-type queries. In this study, we evaluated this drop in performance using TrackList, a fine-grained linguistic and statistical analysis pipeline to investigate the impact of the pre-training data on LLMs answers to diverse linguistic queries. We also introduce RefoMed-EN, an English dataset consisting of 6170 human-annotated medical terms alongside their corresponding definitions, denominations, exemplifications, explanations, or paraphrases. We studied whether the high frequency of a concept (head) or low frequency (tail) impacts the language model's performance. We evaluated the quality of the LLM's output using syntactic and semantic similarity metrics, statistical correlations and embeddings. Results showed that the LLM's task performance for definition type questions is the highest, while for the exemplification type it is the lowest. Additionally, we showed that for definition-type questions, large language models are prone to paraphrase more on popular and frequent knowledge and less on tail and technical knowledge, especially in the expert texts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，上下文学习(ICL)无法覆盖预训练的标签语义，而是主要调整输入如何映射到预训练期间学习的稳定语义方向，这揭示了少样本提示的基本限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨ICL是否能覆盖预训练的标签语义，还是仅仅细化现有的语义骨干，以理解ICL的基本机制和限制。

Method: 将LLMs视为提示诱导分类器，对比自然演示（正确标签）和反转演示（系统翻转标签含义）下的行为，分解ICL行为为三个对齐指标，并引入语义覆盖率。

Result: 在8个分类任务和8个开源LLM上，发现ICL无法学习连贯的反语义分类器，语义覆盖率保持为零，正确预测与零样本行为高度一致。

Conclusion: ICL主要调整输入到稳定语义方向的投影，而非灵活重映射标签含义，表明在这些规模上覆盖标签语义需要ICL之外的干预措施。

Abstract: Can in-context learning (ICL) override pre-trained label semantics, or does it merely refine an existing semantic backbone? We address this question by treating LLMs as prompt-induced classifiers and contrasting their behavior under \emph{natural} demonstrations (with correct labels) and \emph{inverted} demonstrations (systematically flipping label meanings). We decompose ICL behavior into three alignment metrics (truth, prior, and prompt alignment) and introduce a semantic override rate, defined as correctness under flipped semantics. Across eight classification tasks and eight open-source LLMs (1--12B parameters), we find consistent evidence for a semantic anchor view. With natural demonstrations, ICL improves accuracy while maintaining strong prior alignment; most correct predictions coincide with zero-shot behavior, even when the prior is weak. With inverted demonstrations, models cannot learn coherent anti-semantic classifiers: prompt alignment increases only by sacrificing accuracy, and semantic override rates remain exactly zero in our few-shot 1--12B setting. Rather than flexibly remapping label meanings, ICL primarily adjusts how inputs project onto stable semantic directions learned during pre-training, clarifying fundamental limits of few-shot prompting and suggesting that overriding label semantics at these scales requires interventions beyond ICL.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合检索增强的讽刺检测方法，通过外部知识检索和模型内部知识提取来提升LLMs在讽刺检测任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺检测在NLP中仍然具有挑战性，现有的PLMs和LLMs在处理复杂讽刺文本时表现不佳，特别是在面对语言多样性和文化差异时。模型缺乏必要的背景知识来理解需要额外基础的词汇或标记。

Method: 在PMP方法基础上引入检索感知方法，通过两种互补方式提供上下文：1) 基于网络检索的非参数知识补充；2) 激发模型内部知识的自我知识意识策略。

Result: 在Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic数据集上，非参数检索相比原始PMP方法显著提升9.87%的macro-F1；在Semeval和MUStARD数据集上，自我知识检索分别提升3.29%和4.08%的macro-F1。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对于提升LLMs在讽刺检测任务中的性能至关重要，特别是在涉及文化特定俚语、引用或LLMs未知术语时。未来工作将专注于优化相关上下文信息的检索质量。

Abstract: Detecting sarcasm remains a challenging task in the areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) despite recent advances in neural network approaches. Currently, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are the preferred approach for sarcasm detection. However, the complexity of sarcastic text, combined with linguistic diversity and cultural variation across communities, has made the task more difficult even for PLMs and LLMs. Beyond that, those models also exhibit unreliable detection of words or tokens that require extra grounding for analysis. Building on a state-of-the-art prompting method in LLMs for sarcasm detection called Pragmatic Metacognitive Prompting (PMP), we introduce a retrieval-aware approach that incorporates retrieved contextual information for each target text. Our pipeline explores two complementary ways to provide context: adding non-parametric knowledge using web-based retrieval when the model lacks necessary background, and eliciting the model's own internal knowledge for a self-knowledge awareness strategy. We evaluated our approach with three datasets, such as Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic, SemEval-2018 Task 3, and MUStARD. Non-parametric retrieval resulted in a significant 9.87% macro-F1 improvement on Twitter Indonesia Sarcastic compared to the original PMP method. Self-knowledge retrieval improves macro-F1 by 3.29% on Semeval and by 4.08% on MUStARD. These findings highlight the importance of context in enhancing LLMs performance in sarcasm detection task, particularly the involvement of culturally specific slang, references, or unknown terms to the LLMs. Future work will focus on optimizing the retrieval of relevant contextual information and examining how retrieval quality affects performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在缅甸语等低资源语言分类任务中，KANs（Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks）作为分类头比传统MLPs表现更优，在准确性和效率方面都有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在低资源语言分类中通常只微调最后的分类层，而保持预训练编码器权重冻结。MLPs作为常用分类头，其固定非线性限制了表达能力并增加了计算成本。

Method: 探索了三种KAN变体作为分类头：基于傅里叶的FourierKAN、基于样条的EfficientKAN和基于网格的FasterKAN，并在多种嵌入（TF-IDF、fastText、多语言transformers）上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果显示KAN-based heads与MLPs竞争或更优。EfficientKAN与fastText组合获得最高F1分数（0.928），FasterKAN在速度和准确性之间提供最佳平衡。在transformer嵌入上，EfficientKAN与mBERT匹配或略优于MLPs（0.917 F1）。

Conclusion: KANs是MLPs的表达能力强、效率高的替代方案，特别适用于低资源语言分类任务。

Abstract: In low-resource languages like Burmese, classification tasks often fine-tune only the final classification layer, keeping pre-trained encoder weights frozen. While Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are commonly used, their fixed non-linearity can limit expressiveness and increase computational cost. This work explores Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as alternative classification heads, evaluating Fourier-based FourierKAN, Spline-based EfficientKAN, and Grid-based FasterKAN-across diverse embeddings including TF-IDF, fastText, and multilingual transformers (mBERT, Distil-mBERT). Experimental results show that KAN-based heads are competitive with or superior to MLPs. EfficientKAN with fastText achieved the highest F1-score (0.928), while FasterKAN offered the best trade-off between speed and accuracy. On transformer embeddings, EfficientKAN matched or slightly outperformed MLPs with mBERT (0.917 F1). These findings highlight KANs as expressive, efficient alternatives to MLPs for low-resource language classification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估28个不同架构的大语言模型在58个字谜任务上的表现，发现架构差异比参数规模对约束满足能力的影响更大，模型在处理非常规拼写但符合约束的词汇时存在系统性失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在受控文本生成中需要满足硬性拼写约束，但目前缺乏跨架构的系统性评估。研究旨在了解不同模型架构和规模在字符级约束满足任务上的表现差异。

Method: 评估了三个模型家族（Qwen3、Claude Haiku-4.5、GPT-5-mini）的28种配置，在58个需要字符级约束满足的字谜任务上进行测试，并使用10,000名人类解谜者的难度评级进行分析。

Result: 架构差异产生的性能差距（2.0-2.2倍，F1=0.761 vs. 0.343）远大于家族内参数规模扩展带来的增益（83%）。模型在处理拼写不典型但符合约束的常见词汇时失败率很高（89-96%），而人类成功率高达86-95%。

Conclusion: 约束满足可能需要专门的架构特征或训练目标，而不仅仅是标准语言模型规模的扩展。模型过度依赖分布合理性，惩罚了拼写不典型但约束有效的模式，表明需要超越简单参数扩展或计算预算的架构创新。

Abstract: Large language models must satisfy hard orthographic constraints during controlled text generation, yet systematic cross-architecture evaluation remains limited. We evaluate 28 configurations spanning three model families (Qwen3, Claude Haiku-4.5, GPT-5-mini) on 58 word puzzles requiring character-level constraint satisfaction. Architectural differences produce substantially larger performance gaps (2.0-2.2x, F1=0.761 vs. 0.343) than parameter scaling within families (83% gain from eightfold scaling), suggesting that constraint satisfaction may require specialized architectural features or training objectives beyond standard language model scaling. Thinking budget sensitivity proves heterogeneous: high-capacity models show strong returns (+0.102 to +0.136 F1), while mid-sized variants saturate or degrade. These patterns are inconsistent with uniform compute benefits. Using difficulty ratings from 10,000 human solvers per puzzle, we establish modest but consistent calibration (r=0.24-0.38) across all families, yet identify systematic failures on common words with unusual orthography ("data", "poop", "loll": 86-95% human success, 89-96% model miss rate). These failures reveal over-reliance on distributional plausibility that penalizes orthographically atypical but constraint-valid patterns, suggesting architectural innovations may be required beyond simply scaling parameters or computational budgets.

Motivation: 缅甸语作为低资源语言，其ASR错误校正研究尚属空白，需要开发有效的特征集成策略来提升ASR输出质量。

Method: 使用序列到序列Transformer模型，集成IPA音标特征和alignment对齐信息，在五种ASR骨干网络上进行错误校正。

Result: 提出的AEC模型将平均WER从51.56降至39.82（增强前）和43.59（增强后），chrF++得分从0.5864提升至0.627，在所有ASR骨干网络上均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: AEC方法在低资源环境下具有鲁棒性，特征设计对于提升ASR输出质量至关重要，为低资源语言ASR错误校正提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates sequence-to-sequence Transformer models for automatic speech recognition (ASR) error correction in low-resource Burmese, focusing on different feature integration strategies including IPA and alignment information. To our knowledge, this is the first study addressing ASR error correction specifically for Burmese. We evaluate five ASR backbones and show that our ASR Error Correction (AEC) approaches consistently improve word- and character-level accuracy over baseline outputs. The proposed AEC model, combining IPA and alignment features, reduced the average WER of ASR models from 51.56 to 39.82 before augmentation (and 51.56 to 43.59 after augmentation) and improving chrF++ scores from 0.5864 to 0.627, demonstrating consistent gains over the baseline ASR outputs without AEC. Our results highlight the robustness of AEC and the importance of feature design for improving ASR outputs in low-resource settings.

Conclusion: 双专家架构有效解决了专业领域大语言模型在多任务优化中的性能权衡问题，在抵押贷款金融领域实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate exceptional capabilities across general domains, yet their application to specialized sectors such as mortgage finance requires domain-specific knowledge augmentation while preserving instruction-following fidelity. We present MortgageLLM, a novel domain-specific large language model that addresses this dual challenge. It is developed using a dual-track specialization framework from a single base model (LLaMA-3.1-8B). We opted for this dual-expert approach as a single multi-task model suffers from performance trade-offs, where optimizing for structured tasks (via SFT) degrades conversational fidelity (via DPO). Our dual-track method solves this by creating two specialists, allowing each to be optimally trained for its distinct capability. Our approach applies the instruction residual technique to restore instruction-following capabilities post-domain adaptation without supervised fine-tuning. We contribute: (1) application of this residual technique to the highly specialized mortgage finance domain; (2) a dual-expert architecture combining a conversational Q&A model and a structured task model for classification and summarization; and (3) an intelligent task routing mechanism using few-shot classification performed by one of the expert models itself. We validate our approach on domain-specific benchmarks, where our final model (MLM v2) significantly outperforms the base LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, achieving an LLM-as-a-Judge summarization score of 4.58 (vs. 3.99), a Q&A score of 4.09 (vs. 4.0), and a classification score of 2.6 (vs. 1.2). On semantic similarity, our model achieved a BERTScore of 0.77 for summarization (vs. 0.74), 0.68 for Q&A (vs. 0.58), and 0.75 for classification (vs. 0.73), substantially outperforming baseline approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但其面对对抗性越狱提示的安全性仍面临挑战。这类提示具有隐蔽性和欺骗性，常能绕过内置安全机制导致有害内容生成，因此需要自适应安全对齐方法。

Method: SGASA框架包含两个关键阶段：数据预合成（生成安全准则和增强提示）和对齐微调（使用监督微调和直接偏好优化将准则嵌入模型）。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，SGASA显著提高了模型安全性，验证了其自适应和可扩展的有效性。

Conclusion: SGASA框架通过内部化模型生成的安全准则，有效增强了模型对有害对抗提示的鲁棒性，同时最小化了对良性请求的不必要拒绝。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning tasks. However, ensuring their safety against adversarial jailbreak prompts remains a critical challenge. Due to the covert and deceptive nature of such prompts, they can often evade built-in safety mechanisms and lead to the generation of harmful content. This underscores the need for an adaptive safety alignment approach that enables models to autonomously reinforce their defenses in response to adversarial inputs. This paper introduces the Synthesized Guideline-based Adaptive Safety Alignment (SGASA) framework, which internalizes model-generated safety guidelines to strengthen models' ability to enhance robustness against harmful adversarial prompts while minimizing unnecessary refusals of benign requests. SGASA consists of two key stages: Data Pre-synthesis, which generates safety guidelines and augmented prompts; and Alignment Fine-tuning, which leverages Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to embed these guidelines into the model. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that SGASA significantly improves model safety, validating its adaptive and scalable effectiveness.

TL;DR: 研究表明，在人类调查数据上进行微调可以改善LLM模拟的多样性和对齐性，但即使经过微调的模型也无法准确复现原始研究的回归系数，因此LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析。

Motivation: 探讨是否通过在小型人类调查数据上进行微调，可以缓解LLM在模拟人类行为时出现的多样性不足、与少数群体对齐偏差、组内方差不足以及信念与行动不一致等问题。

Method: 使用信息披露行为实验，比较人类和LLM生成的响应，从分布差异、子群体对齐、信念-行动一致性和回归系数恢复等多个维度进行分析。

Result: 在小型人类样本上进行微调显著提高了相对于基础模型的异质性、对齐性和信念-行动一致性，但即使表现最好的微调模型也无法复现原始研究的回归系数。

Conclusion: LLM生成的数据仍不适合替代人类参与者进行正式推断分析，尽管微调可以改善某些方面的模拟效果。

Abstract: There is ongoing debate about whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as substitutes for human participants in survey and experimental research. While recent work in fields such as marketing and psychology has explored the potential of LLM-based simulation, a growing body of evidence cautions against this practice: LLMs often fail to align with real human behavior, exhibiting limited diversity, systematic misalignment for minority subgroups, insufficient within-group variance, and discrepancies between stated beliefs and actions. This study examines an important and distinct question in this domain: whether fine-tuning on a small subset of human survey data, such as that obtainable from a pilot study, can mitigate these issues and yield realistic simulated outcomes. Using a behavioral experiment on information disclosure, we compare human and LLM-generated responses across multiple dimensions, including distributional divergence, subgroup alignment, belief-action coherence, and the recovery of regression coefficients. We find that fine-tuning on small human samples substantially improves heterogeneity, alignment, and belief-action coherence relative to the base model. However, even the best-performing fine-tuned models fail to reproduce the regression coefficients of the original study, suggesting that LLM-generated data remain unsuitable for replacing human participants in formal inferential analyses.

Conclusion: 通过发布这一开放数据集，旨在促进包容性AI发展，支持研究代表性不足的语言，并为解决对话语音建模中的语言和技术挑战提供基础。

Abstract: This paper introduces the development of the first open conversational speech dataset for the Isan language, the most widely spoken regional dialect in Thailand. Unlike existing speech corpora that are primarily based on read or scripted speech, this dataset consists of natural speech, thereby capturing authentic linguistic phenomena such as colloquials, spontaneous prosody, disfluencies, and frequent code-switching with central Thai. A key challenge in building this resource lies in the lack of a standardized orthography for Isan. Current writing practices vary considerably, due to the different lexical tones between Thai and Isan. This variability complicates the design of transcription guidelines and poses questions regarding consistency, usability, and linguistic authenticity. To address these issues, we establish practical transcription protocols that balance the need for representational accuracy with the requirements of computational processing. By releasing this dataset as an open resource, we aim to contribute to inclusive AI development, support research on underrepresented languages, and provide a basis for addressing the linguistic and technical challenges inherent in modeling conversational speech.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) achieved on many tasks, their massive scale often leads to high computational and environmental costs, limiting their accessibility. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods address this challenge by reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining strong downstream performance. Despite the increased development in PEFT methods, current evaluations remain limited (in terms of evaluated models and datasets) and difficult to reproduce. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEFT-Bench, a unified end-to-end benchmark for evaluating diverse PEFT methods on autoregressive LLMs. We demonstrate its usage across 27 NLP datasets and 6 PEFT methods. To account for different PEFT training and inference factors, we also introduce the PEFT Soft Score Penalties (PSCP) metric, which takes trainable parameters, inference speed, and training memory usage into account.

### [148] [Emergent Lexical Semantics in Neural Language Models: Testing Martin's Law on LLM-Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21334)
*Kai Kugler*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了神经网络语言模型训练过程中生成的文本是否遵循Martin定律（词频与多义性之间的经验关系），发现该规律呈现非单调发展轨迹，在特定训练检查点达到峰值后开始退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索神经网络语言模型在训练过程中是否以及如何发展出符合人类语言规律（如Martin定律）的语义结构，这对于理解LLM的语言习得机制具有重要意义。

Method: 使用DBSCAN聚类上下文嵌入作为词义操作化方法，分析了四个Pythia模型（70M-1B参数）在30个训练检查点上的表现。

Result: 结果显示Martin定律在检查点100左右出现，在检查点104达到峰值相关性（r>0.6），然后在检查点105开始退化。小模型在后期检查点经历灾难性语义崩溃，而大模型则呈现优雅退化。频率-特异性权衡在所有模型中保持稳定（r≈-0.3）。

Conclusion: LLM生成文本对语言规律的遵循并非随训练单调增加，而是遵循平衡轨迹，存在最佳语义窗口。本研究为评估神经网络语言模型中的涌现语言结构建立了新方法。

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of Martin's Law - the empirical relationship between word frequency and polysemy - in text generated by neural language models during training. Using DBSCAN clustering of contextualized embeddings as an operationalization of word senses, we analyze four Pythia models (70M-1B parameters) across 30 training checkpoints. Our results reveal a non-monotonic developmental trajectory: Martin's Law emerges around checkpoint 100, reaches peak correlation (r > 0.6) at checkpoint 104, then degrades by checkpoint 105. Smaller models (70M, 160M) experience catastrophic semantic collapse at late checkpoints, while larger models (410M, 1B) show graceful degradation. The frequency-specificity trade-off remains stable (r $\approx$ -0.3) across all models. These findings suggest that compliance with linguistic regularities in LLM-generated text is not monotonically increasing with training, but instead follows a balanced trajectory with an optimal semantic window. This work establishes a novel methodology for evaluating emergent linguistic structure in neural language models.

### [149] [Training Introspective Behavior: Fine-Tuning Induces Reliable Internal State Detection in a 7B Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21399)
*Joshua Fonseca Rivera*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过微调训练，7B参数模型从几乎完全失败转变为能够可靠检测单令牌注入的"想法"，准确率达到85%，假阳性率为0%，满足Lindsey提出的准确性、基础性和内部性标准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过直接训练而非等待自然涌现来获得语言模型的内省能力，特别是检测和识别注入激活模式的能力。

Method: 通过对瞬态单令牌注入进行微调训练，使模型能够检测单令牌位置注入的短暂"想法"，保留该信息并在后续生成步骤中报告语义内容。

Result: 模型从0.4%准确率和6.7%假阳性率提升到85%准确率（在α=40时），对未见概念向量的泛化能力显示模型学习了可转移技能而非记忆特定向量。

Conclusion: 研究表明至少一种内省行为组件可以通过直接训练诱导，为构建内置AI透明度提供了途径，回答了Lindsey关于"训练内省是否能消除跨模型差异"的开放性问题。

Abstract: Lindsey (2025) investigates introspective awareness in language models through four experiments, finding that models can sometimes detect and identify injected activation patterns -- but unreliably (~20% success in the best model). We focus on the first of these experiments -- self-report of injected "thoughts" -- and ask whether this capability can be directly trained rather than waiting for emergence. Through fine-tuning on transient single-token injections, we transform a 7B parameter model from near-complete failure (0.4% accuracy, 6.7% false positive rate) to reliable detection (85% accuracy on held-out concepts at α=40, 0% false positives). Our model detects fleeting "thoughts" injected at a single token position, retains that information, and reports the semantic content across subsequent generation steps. On this task, our trained model satisfies three of Lindsey's criteria: accuracy (correct identification), grounding (0/60 false positives), and internality (detection precedes verbalization). Generalization to unseen concept vectors (7.5pp gap) demonstrates the model learns a transferable skill rather than memorizing specific vectors, though this does not establish metacognitive representation in Lindsey's sense. These results address an open question raised by Lindsey: whether "training for introspection would help eliminate cross-model differences." We show that at least one component of introspective behavior can be directly induced, offering a pathway to built-in AI transparency.

*Antonín Jarolím,Martin Fajčík,Lucia Makaiová*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了捷克语和斯洛伐克语细粒度证据提取数据集，评估了LLMs在证据提取任务上的表现，发现LLMs经常无法逐字复制源文本证据，导致输出无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线新闻评论中经常传播错误信息，需要有效方法检测事实错误信息。为了支持或反驳从评论中提取的声明，需要识别相关文档并精确定位证明或反驳每个声明的确切文本片段。

Method: 创建了由付费标注者标注的双向细粒度证据数据集，评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在该数据集上的表现，分析其与人工标注的一致性。

Result: LLMs经常无法逐字复制源文本证据，导致无效输出。llama3.1:8b模型尽管规模较小但正确输出比例高，而gpt-oss-120b模型尽管参数更多但表现不佳。qwen3:14b、deepseek-r1:32b和gpt-oss:20b在模型大小与人工标注一致性之间达到了有效平衡。

Conclusion: LLMs在细粒度证据提取任务中存在局限性，特别是在逐字复制源文本方面。模型大小与性能并非完全正相关，某些中等规模模型在准确性和效率方面表现更好。

Abstract: Misinformation frequently spreads in user comments under online news articles, highlighting the need for effective methods to detect factually incorrect information. To strongly support or refute claims extracted from such comments, it is necessary to identify relevant documents and pinpoint the exact text spans that justify or contradict each claim. This paper focuses on the latter task -- fine-grained evidence extraction for Czech and Slovak claims. We create new dataset, containing two-way annotated fine-grained evidence created by paid annotators. We evaluate large language models (LLMs) on this dataset to assess their alignment with human annotations. The results reveal that LLMs often fail to copy evidence verbatim from the source text, leading to invalid outputs. Error-rate analysis shows that the {llama3.1:8b model achieves a high proportion of correct outputs despite its relatively small size, while the gpt-oss-120b model underperforms despite having many more parameters. Furthermore, the models qwen3:14b, deepseek-r1:32b, and gpt-oss:20b demonstrate an effective balance between model size and alignment with human annotations.

*Zhifeng Hao,Qibin Song,Ruichu Cai,Boyan Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DSR-SQL是一个双状态推理框架，通过自适应上下文状态和渐进生成状态的交互来解决复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL问题，无需后训练或上下文示例即可达到竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分治推理方法在处理复杂企业数据库时，由于上下文容量有限、模式链接不可靠和数据库语义基础薄弱，难以保持连贯推理。

Method: DSR-SQL将Text-to-SQL建模为自适应上下文状态和渐进生成状态的交互。前者通过精炼大型模式和选择相关结构构建紧凑的语义忠实环境，后者将SQL合成形式化为反馈引导的状态转换，使模型能够自我纠正并与用户意图对齐。

Result: 在Spider 2.0-Snow上达到35.28%的执行准确率，在BIRD开发集上达到68.32%的执行准确率。

Conclusion: DSR-SQL框架有效解决了复杂企业数据库中的Text-to-SQL挑战，展示了在无需额外训练或示例的情况下实现竞争性性能的能力。

Abstract: Recent divide-and-conquer reasoning approaches, particularly those based on Chain-of-Thought (CoT), have substantially improved the Text-to-SQL capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when applied to complex enterprise databases, such methods struggle to maintain coherent reasoning due to limited context capacity, unreliable schema linking, and weak grounding in database semantics. To overcome these issues, we introduce DSR-SQL, a \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tate \textbf{R}easoning framework that models Text-to-SQL as an interaction between an adaptive context state and a progressive generation state. The first constructs a compact, semantically faithful environment by refining large schemas and selecting relevant structures, while the second formalizes SQL synthesis as feedback-guided state transitions, enabling the model to self-correct and align with user intent. Without any post-training or in-context examples, DSR-SQL achieves competitive performance, reaching 35.28\% execution accuracy on Spider 2.0-Snow and 68.32\% on BIRD development set. Our implementation will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/DMIRLAB-Group/DSR-SQL.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Odin是一种新型架构，通过定向双模块机制在特定Transformer层注入图结构，避免了传统GNN的过平滑问题和Transformer忽略图拓扑的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖GNN（受限于过平滑和跳数依赖扩散），要么使用Transformer（忽略图拓扑并将节点视为孤立序列），需要一种能有效结合文本理解和结构推理的模型。

Method: 提出Odin架构，在选定深度的Transformer层通过定向双模块机制注入图结构，不依赖多跳扩散，而是在特定层集成多跳结构，产生与语义层次对齐的低、中、高级结构抽象。

Result: 在多个文本丰富图基准测试中，Odin实现了最先进的准确率，而轻量版Light Odin以显著降低的计算成本提供了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Odin和Light Odin形成了一个统一的、无跳数的框架，用于原则性的结构与文本集成，其表达能力严格包含纯Transformer和GNN。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs require models to effectively combine strong textual understanding with structurally informed reasoning. Existing approaches either rely on GNNs--limited by over-smoothing and hop-dependent diffusion--or employ Transformers that overlook graph topology and treat nodes as isolated sequences. We propose Odin (Oriented Dual-module INtegration), a new architecture that injects graph structure into Transformers at selected depths through an oriented dual-module mechanism.Unlike message-passing GNNs, Odin does not rely on multi-hop diffusion; instead, multi-hop structures are integrated at specific Transformer layers, yielding low-, mid-, and high-level structural abstraction aligned with the model's semantic hierarchy. Because aggregation operates on the global [CLS] representation, Odin fundamentally avoids over-smoothing and decouples structural abstraction from neighborhood size or graph topology. We further establish that Odin's expressive power strictly contains that of both pure Transformers and GNNs.To make the design efficient in large-scale or low-resource settings, we introduce Light Odin, a lightweight variant that preserves the same layer-aligned structural abstraction for faster training and inference. Experiments on multiple text-rich graph benchmarks show that Odin achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, while Light Odin delivers competitive performance with significantly reduced computational cost. Together, Odin and Light Odin form a unified, hop-free framework for principled structure-text integration. The source code of this model has been released at https://github.com/hongkaifeng/Odin.

TL;DR: 对六种最先进的模型合并方法在大型语言模型上进行大规模系统评估，发现最简单的方法Task Arithmetic是唯一能可靠提升性能的方法，其他方法通常导致显著性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型合并提供了一种无需额外训练即可复用模型并高效提升性能的方法，但尚不清楚小模型和分类器上的优势是否能推广到LLMs。

Method: 对六种最先进的合并方法（包括子空间方法）在四个开源LLMs上进行系统评估，每个基础模型使用12个微调检查点，在16个标准LLM基准上进行测试。

Result: 最古老最简单的Task Arithmetic方法是唯一能可靠获得性能增益的方法，其他干扰感知和子空间合并方法通常导致显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 当前合并技术不能直接迁移到现代LLMs，这促使需要设计LLM特定的合并算法和合并感知的微调方法。

Abstract: Model merging combines multiple fine-tuned checkpoints into a single model without additional training, offering an attractive approach to reusing models and efficiently improving performance. However, it remains unclear whether the advantages reported for smaller models and classifiers generalize to LLMs. We present a large-scale, systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art merging methods, including recent subspace methods, across four open-weight LLMs, twelve fine-tuned checkpoints per base model, and sixteen standard LLM benchmarks. Evaluating through standardized benchmarks, we measure both the probability that a merged model outperforms the base model and relative gains over the best individual checkpoint. Our results show that the oldest and simplest method, Task Arithmetic, is the only approach that reliably yields performance gains on LLMs. Other interference-aware and subspace merging methods typically result in significant performance drops. Our findings indicate that current merging techniques do not directly transfer to modern LLMs. This motivates the design of LLM-specific merging algorithms and merging-aware fine-tuning methods. Code will be released upon acceptance of this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习可读性评估方法大多未能同时考虑文本长度和可读性标签的序数关系。

Method: 双向可读性评估机制：1) 识别语义丰富区域预测句子级可读性；2) 利用句子级标签辅助文档级可读性预测；3) 引入成对排序算法通过标签减法建模序数关系。

Result: 在中文和英文数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型取得了有竞争力的性能，并优于其他基线模型。

Conclusion: 所提出的双向机制和排序算法能够有效提升可读性评估性能，特别是在处理文本长度和标签序数关系方面表现出优势。

Abstract: Readability assessment aims to evaluate the reading difficulty of a text. In recent years, while deep learning technology has been gradually applied to readability assessment, most approaches fail to consider either the length of the text or the ordinal relationship of readability labels. This paper proposes a bidirectional readability assessment mechanism that captures contextual information to identify regions with rich semantic information in the text, thereby predicting the readability level of individual sentences. These sentence-level labels are then used to assist in predicting the overall readability level of the document. Additionally, a pairwise sorting algorithm is introduced to model the ordinal relationship between readability levels through label subtraction. Experimental results on Chinese and English datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive performance and outperforms other baseline models.

TL;DR: 研究语音翻译模型中性别分配机制，发现模型不简单复制训练数据中的性别关联，而是学习更广泛的男性主导模式。模型能够基于声学输入覆盖内部语言模型的男性偏见，并通过第一人称代词将性别化术语与说话者关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音翻译中，当从有概念性性别的语言翻译到语法性别语言时，说话者的声音特征可能在性别分配中起作用，存在误判性别的风险。但目前对语音翻译模型如何做出这些决策的理解不足。

Method: 研究三个语言对（英-西/法/意）的语音翻译模型性别分配机制，分析训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用，使用对比特征归因分析频谱图。

Result: 模型学习更广泛的男性主导模式而非简单复制训练数据中的特定术语性别关联。内部语言模型表现出强烈男性偏见，但模型能基于声学输入覆盖这些偏好。高性别准确率模型使用第一人称代词将性别化术语与说话者关联，利用分布在频率谱而非集中在音高的性别信息。

Conclusion: 语音翻译模型通过复杂的机制进行性别分配，涉及训练数据模式、内部语言模型偏见和声学信息的相互作用，揭示了使用第一人称代词链接说话者与性别化术语的新机制。

Abstract: Unlike text, speech conveys information about the speaker, such as gender, through acoustic cues like pitch. This gives rise to modality-specific bias concerns. For example, in speech translation (ST), when translating from languages with notional gender, such as English, into languages where gender-ambiguous terms referring to the speaker are assigned grammatical gender, the speaker's vocal characteristics may play a role in gender assignment. This risks misgendering speakers, whether through masculine defaults or vocal-based assumptions. Yet, how ST models make these decisions remains poorly understood. We investigate the mechanisms ST models use to assign gender to speaker-referring terms across three language pairs (en-es/fr/it), examining how training data patterns, internal language model (ILM) biases, and acoustic information interact. We find that models do not simply replicate term-specific gender associations from training data, but learn broader patterns of masculine prevalence. While the ILM exhibits strong masculine bias, models can override these preferences based on acoustic input. Using contrastive feature attribution on spectrograms, we reveal that the model with higher gender accuracy relies on a previously unknown mechanism: using first-person pronouns to link gendered terms back to the speaker, accessing gender information distributed across the frequency spectrum rather than concentrated in pitch.

Abstract: Bangla Sign Language Translation (BdSLT) has been severely constrained so far as the language itself is very low resource. Standard sentence level dataset creation for BdSLT is of immense importance for developing AI based assistive tools for deaf and hard of hearing people of Bangla speaking community. In this paper, we present a dataset, IsharaKhobor , and two subset of it for enabling research. We also present the challenges towards developing the dataset and present some way forward by benchmarking with landmark based raw and RQE embedding. We do some ablation on vocabulary restriction and canonicalization of the same within the dataset, which resulted in two more datasets, IsharaKhobor_small and IsharaKhobor_canonical_small. The dataset is publicly available at: www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasanssl/isharakhobor [1].

TL;DR: RoParQ基准测试评估LLM在转述问题中的一致性，提出XParaCon指标和基于推理的SFT策略，显著提升了模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在回答转述问题时表现出不一致行为，表明其依赖表层模式而非真正的语义理解，需要评估和改进这种跨转述一致性。

Method: 从标准数据集构建RoParQ基准，通过专有模型生成转述并筛选不一致样本；提出XParaCon评估指标；实施基于推理的转述感知SFT策略。

Result: 经过针对性对齐后，轻量级微调模型达到了与更大预训练模型相当的鲁棒性水平，显著提升了跨转述一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减轻了表层记忆依赖，促进了更鲁棒可靠的LLM发展，证明了语义不变性对齐策略的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit inconsistent behavior when answering paraphrased questions, suggesting a reliance on surface-level patterns rather than true semantic understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce RoParQ, a benchmark specifically constructed to evaluate cross-paraphrase consistency in closed-book multiple-choice QA. This benchmark is derived from standard datasets by generating paraphrases via proprietary models and selectively retaining examples that elicit inconsistent confidence from a judge model. We further propose XParaCon, a novel evaluation metric that quantifies a model's robustness by measuring the standard deviation of accuracies across question variants. Additionally, we implement a reasoning-based, paraphrase-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategy designed to align models toward semantic invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted alignment significantly enhances robustness. Notably, fine-tuned lightweight models achieved consistency levels comparable to much larger pre-trained models. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach in mitigating superficial memorization and fostering more robust, reliable LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在各种任务上表现出卓越能力，但其内部机制仍然不透明，需要开发方法来理解模型如何编码特定技能。

Method: 基于先前通过软提示训练识别技能神经元的工作，将分析扩展到涉及多种技能的复杂场景，通过关联神经元激活与辅助指标（外部标签和模型置信度）来识别任务特定神经元。

Result: 在开放式文本生成和自然语言推理任务上验证了该方法，能够检测出不仅驱动已知技能还能揭示算术推理中先前未识别捷径的神经元。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效识别大语言模型中编码特定技能的神经元，为理解模型内部机制提供了新的途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, yet their internal mechanisms remain largely opaque. In this paper, we introduce a simple, lightweight, and broadly applicable method with a focus on isolating neurons that encode specific skills. Building upon prior work that identified "skill neurons" via soft prompt training on classification tasks, our approach extends the analysis to complex scenarios involving multiple skills. We correlate neuron activations with auxiliary metrics -- such as external labels and the model's own confidence score -- thereby uncovering interpretable and task-specific behaviors without the need for manual token aggregation. We empirically validate our method on tasks spanning open-ended text generation and natural language inference, demonstrating its ability to detect neurons that not only drive known skills but also reveal previously unidentified shortcuts in arithmetic reasoning on BigBench.

Conclusion: 研究结果为整合元数据以提升LLM预训练效率和效果提供了实用指南，证明了多种元数据类型在加速训练方面的潜力。

Abstract: Incorporating metadata in Large Language Models (LLMs) pretraining has recently emerged as a promising approach to accelerate training. However prior work highlighted only one useful signal-URLs, leaving open the question of whether other forms of metadata could yield greater benefits. In this study, we investigate a wider range of metadata types and find other types of metadata, such as fine-grained indicators of document quality that can also accelerate pretraining when prepended. We identify a common feature among effective metadata: they encode information at a finer granularity. We further introduce metadata appending as a means of improving training efficiency, where predicting an appropriate metadata as auxiliary task can help speed up pretraining. In addition, learnable meta-tokens trained with masked loss can recover part of the speedup by inducing quality-aware latent structure. Using probing, we analyze latent representations to understand how metadata shapes learning. Together, these results yield practical guidelines for integrating metadata to improve both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining.

Motivation: 研究AI在捷克语这种形态复杂、训练数据较少的斯拉夫语言中生成诗歌的能力，以及人们对其的感知和审美评价。

Method: 让捷克母语者识别AI和人类创作的诗歌，并进行审美评价，使用逻辑回归模型分析数据。

Result: 参与者无法有效区分AI和人类诗歌，识别准确率接近随机水平。审美评价受作者偏见影响，认为AI创作的诗歌评分更低。

Conclusion: AI能够生成令人信服的捷克诗歌，读者对作者身份的信念与诗歌的审美评价密切相关。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly capable of producing creative texts, yet most studies on AI-generated poetry focus on English -- a language that dominates training data. In this paper, we examine the perception of AI- and human-written Czech poetry. We ask if Czech native speakers are able to identify it and how they aesthetically judge it. Participants performed at chance level when guessing authorship (45.8\% correct on average), indicating that Czech AI-generated poems were largely indistinguishable from human-written ones. Aesthetic evaluations revealed a strong authorship bias: when participants believed a poem was AI-generated, they rated it as less favorably, even though AI poems were in fact rated equally or more favorably than human ones on average. The logistic regression model uncovered that the more the people liked a poem, the less probable was that they accurately assign the authorship. Familiarity with poetry or literary background had no effect on recognition accuracy. Our findings show that AI can convincingly produce poetry even in a morphologically complex, low-resource (with respect of the training data of AI models) Slavic language such as Czech. The results suggest that readers' beliefs about authorship and the aesthetic evaluation of the poem are interconnected.

Abstract: Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis often depend on a centralized orchestrator, creating scalability bottlenecks, or are hardcoded for specific domains, limiting flexibility. We present \textbf{Matrix}, a decentralized framework that represents both control and data flow as serialized messages passed through distributed queues. This peer-to-peer design eliminates the central orchestrator. Each task progresses independently through lightweight agents, while compute-intensive operations, such as LLM inference or containerized environments, are handled by distributed services. Built on Ray, Matrix scales to tens of thousands of concurrent agentic workflows and provides a modular, configurable design that enables easy adaptation to a wide range of data generation workflows. We evaluate Matrix across diverse synthesis scenarios, such as multi-agent collaborative dialogue, web-based reasoning data extraction, and tool-use trajectory generation in customer service environments. In all cases, Matrix achieves $2$--$15\times$ higher data generation throughput under identical hardware resources, without compromising output quality.

TL;DR: ToolOrchestra方法训练小型编排器来协调智能工具，在解决复杂任务时比大型模型更高效且性能更好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型功能强大，但解决深度复杂问题（如Humanity's Last Exam）在概念上具有挑战性且计算成本高昂

Method: 使用强化学习训练小型编排器，包含结果、效率和用户偏好感知的奖励机制

Result: Orchestrator模型在HLE上得分37.1%，超越GPT-5（35.1%）且效率提高2.5倍；在tau2-Bench和FRAMES上大幅超越GPT-5，仅使用约30%成本

Conclusion: 使用轻量级编排模型组合多样化工具比现有方法更高效有效，为实用且可扩展的工具增强推理系统铺平道路

Abstract: Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce ToolOrchestra, a method for training small orchestrators that coordinate intelligent tools. ToolOrchestra explicitly uses reinforcement learning with outcome-, efficiency-, and user-preference-aware rewards. Using ToolOrchestra, we produce Orchestrator, an 8B model that achieves higher accuracy at lower cost than previous tool-use agents while aligning with user preferences on which tools are to be used for a given query. On HLE, Orchestrator achieves a score of 37.1%, outperforming GPT-5 (35.1%) while being 2.5x more efficient. On tau2-Bench and FRAMES, Orchestrator surpasses GPT-5 by a wide margin while using only about 30% of the cost. Extensive analysis shows that Orchestrator achieves the best trade-off between performance and cost under multiple metrics, and generalizes robustly to unseen tools. These results demonstrate that composing diverse tools with a lightweight orchestration model is both more efficient and more effective than existing methods, paving the way for practical and scalable tool-augmented reasoning systems.

*Yeganeh Kordi,Nihal V. Nayak,Max Zuo,Ilana Nguyen,Stephen H. Bach*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过系统评估大语言模型在不同难度任务上的泛化能力，发现跨难度泛化通常有限，训练数据难度选择无法在整个难度范围内实现一致改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究对于训练数据难度（容易或困难）对模型性能的影响存在争议，需要更客观、大规模的分析来理解LLMs在不同难度任务上的泛化能力。

Method: 使用数千个不同LLMs的输出和项目反应理论（IRT）对六个数据集中的示例进行难度排名，完全基于LLMs能力而非人类主观判断来确定难度评级。

Result: 跨难度泛化能力有限，无论使用容易还是困难数据进行训练，都无法在整个难度范围内实现一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: LLMs的训练和评估数据需要包含不同难度的示例，在难度选择上走捷径存在风险。

Abstract: We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' generalization across models, datasets, and fine-grained groups of example difficulty. We rank examples in six datasets using the outputs of thousands of different LLMs and Item Response Theory (IRT), a well-established difficulty metric in educational testing. Unlike prior work, our difficulty ratings are therefore determined solely by the abilities of many different LLMs, excluding human opinions of difficulty. With a more objective, larger-scale, and finer-grained analysis, we show that cross-difficulty generalization is often limited; training on either easy or hard data cannot achieve consistent improvements across the full range of difficulties. These results show the importance of having a range of difficulties in both training and evaluation data for LLMs, and that taking shortcuts with respect to difficulty is risky.

### [164] [Minimizing Hyperbolic Embedding Distortion with LLM-Guided Hierarchy Restructuring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20679)
*Melika Ayoughi,Pascal Mettes,Paul Groth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究利用大语言模型自动重构层次结构以优化双曲嵌入质量，实验表明LLM重构的层次结构能显著提升嵌入质量，并提供可解释的重组理由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲嵌入的质量与输入层次结构密切相关，而现有层次结构往往不符合双曲嵌入的最佳条件（高分支因子和单继承）。本文旨在探索LLMs能否自动重构层次结构以满足这些标准。

Method: 提出基于提示的方法，使用LLMs根据双曲嵌入的需求准则来转换现有层次结构，在16个不同层次结构上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM重构的层次结构在多个标准嵌入质量指标上都能产生更高质量的双曲嵌入。

Conclusion: LLM引导的层次结构重构不仅能提升双曲嵌入质量，还能为知识工程师提供可解释的重组理由，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Hyperbolic geometry is an effective geometry for embedding hierarchical data structures. Hyperbolic learning has therefore become increasingly prominent in machine learning applications where data is hierarchically organized or governed by hierarchical semantics, ranging from recommendation systems to computer vision. The quality of hyperbolic embeddings is tightly coupled to the structure of the input hierarchy, which is often derived from knowledge graphs or ontologies. Recent work has uncovered that for an optimal hyperbolic embedding, a high branching factor and single inheritance are key, while embedding algorithms are robust to imbalance and hierarchy size. To assist knowledge engineers in reorganizing hierarchical knowledge, this paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) have the ability to automatically restructure hierarchies to meet these criteria. We propose a prompt-based approach to transform existing hierarchies using LLMs, guided by known desiderata for hyperbolic embeddings. Experiments on 16 diverse hierarchies show that LLM-restructured hierarchies consistently yield higher-quality hyperbolic embeddings across several standard embedding quality metrics. Moreover, we show how LLM-guided hierarchy restructuring enables explainable reorganizations, providing justifications to knowledge engineers.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative AI necessitates robust safety evaluations. However, current safety datasets are predominantly English-centric, failing to capture specific risks in non-English, socio-cultural contexts such as Korean, and are often limited to the text modality. To address this gap, we introduce AssurAI, a new quality-controlled Korean multimodal dataset for evaluating the safety of generative AI. First, we define a taxonomy of 35 distinct AI risk factors, adapted from established frameworks by a multidisciplinary expert group to cover both universal harms and relevance to the Korean socio-cultural context. Second, leveraging this taxonomy, we construct and release AssurAI, a large-scale Korean multimodal dataset comprising 11,480 instances across text, image, video, and audio. Third, we apply the rigorous quality control process used to ensure data integrity, featuring a two-phase construction (i.e., expert-led seeding and crowdsourced scaling), triple independent annotation, and an iterative expert red-teaming loop. Our pilot study validates AssurAI's effectiveness in assessing the safety of recent LLMs. We release AssurAI to the public to facilitate the development of safer and more reliable generative AI systems for the Korean community.

Conclusion: A²Flow通过完全自动化的算子提取和工作流生成，显著提升了智能体工作流设计的效率和性能，为自动化工作流构建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in automating the design of agentic workflows. However, existing methods still rely heavily on manually predefined operators, limiting generalization and scalability. To address this issue, we propose $A^2Flow$, a fully automated framework for agentic workflow generation based on self-adaptive abstraction operators. $A^2Flow$ employs a three-stage operator extraction process: 1) Case-based Initial Operator Generation: leveraging expert demonstrations and LLM reasoning to generate case-specific operators; 2) Operator Clustering and Preliminary Abstraction: grouping similar operators across tasks to form preliminary abstractions; and 3) Deep Extraction for Abstract Execution Operators: applying long chain-of-thought prompting and multi-path reasoning to derive compact and generalizable execution operators. These operators serve as reusable building blocks for workflow construction without manual predefinition. Furthermore, we enhance node-level workflow search with an operator memory mechanism, which retains historical outputs to enrich context and improve decision-making. Experiments on general and embodied benchmarks show that $A^2Flow$ achieves a 2.4\% and 19.3\% average performance improvement and reduces resource usage by 37\% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Scientific reasoning through Large Language Models in heliophysics involves more than just recalling facts: it requires incorporating physical assumptions, maintaining consistent units, and providing clear scientific formats through coordinated approaches. To address these challenges, we present Reasoning With a Star, a newly contributed heliophysics dataset applicable to reasoning; we also provide an initial benchmarking approach. Our data are constructed from National Aeronautics and Space Administration & University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Living With a Star summer school problem sets and compiled into a readily consumable question-and-answer structure with question contexts, reasoning steps, expected answer type, ground-truth targets, format hints, and metadata. A programmatic grader checks the predictions using unit-aware numerical tolerance, symbolic equivalence, and schema validation. We benchmark a single-shot baseline and four multi-agent patterns, finding that decomposing workflows through systems engineering principles outperforms direct prompting on problems requiring deductive reasoning rather than pure inductive recall.

Abstract: Emerging from NASA's spacecraft simulations in the 1960s, digital twin technology has advanced through industrial adoption to spark a healthcare transformation. A digital twin is a dynamic, data-driven virtual counterpart of a physical system, continuously updated through real-time data streams and capable of bidirectional interaction. In medicine, digital twin integrates imaging, biosensors, and computational models to generate patient-specific simulations that support diagnosis, treatment planning, and drug development. Representative applications include cardiac digital twin for predicting arrhythmia treatment outcomes, oncology digital twin for tracking tumor progression and optimizing radiotherapy, and pharmacological digital twin for accelerating drug discovery. Despite rapid progress, major challenges, including interoperability, data privacy, and model fidelity, continue to limit widespread clinical integration. Emerging solutions such as explainable AI, federated learning, and harmonized regulatory frameworks offer promising pathways forward. Looking ahead, advances in multi-organ digital twin, genomics integration, and ethical governance will be essential to ensure that digital twin shifts healthcare from reactive treatment to predictive, preventive, and truly personalized medicine.

TL;DR: 本文对多模态思维链(Multimodal-CoT)在不同领域数据集上的泛化能力进行了综合分析，发现虽然视觉特征能减少推理幻觉，但思维链推理效果在不同问题类型间差异显著，特别是在常识推理方面存在挑战。

Motivation: 虽然CoT已在多模态科学问答中取得SOTA结果，但其在不同领域的泛化能力尚未充分探索。本研究旨在评估Multimodal-CoT在需要广泛常识和世界知识的A-OKVQA、OKVQA和ChartQA数据集上的有效性。

Method: 采用Zhang等人提出的两阶段框架，将推理生成与答案推断分离，通过门控融合机制将视觉特征与基于T5的语言模型集成，并进行系统消融研究分析视觉特征、推理质量和架构选择的贡献。

Result: 视觉集成显著减少了推理生成中的幻觉，但CoT推理效果在不同问题类型间差异很大，常识推理尤其具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 本研究为实施多模态推理系统的研究人员提供了实用见解，并确定了跨领域泛化未来改进的关键方向。

Abstract: While recent work has extended CoT to multimodal settings, achieving state-of-the-art results on science question answering benchmarks like ScienceQA, the generalizability of these approaches across diverse domains remains underexplored. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Multimodal-CoT) reasoning, evaluating its effectiveness on the A-OKVQA, OKVQA and ChartQA datasets, which requires broad commonsense and world knowledge beyond scientific reasoning. We implement the two-stage framework proposed by Zhang et al. [3], which separates rationale generation from answer inference and integrates vision features through a gated fusion mechanism with T5-based language models. Through systematic ablation studies, we analyze the contributions of vision features, rationale quality, and architectural choices. Our findings reveal that while vision integration significantly reduces hallucination in rationale generation, the effectiveness of CoT reasoning varies substantially across question types, with commonsense reasoning presenting particular challenges. This work provides practical insights for researchers implementing multimodal reasoning systems and identifies key areas for future improvement in cross-domain generalization.

Conclusion: 该框架验证了作为未来无线网络稳健智能解决方案的潜力，展示了AI代理在动态网络协调中的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-access point coordination (MAPC) is a key technology for enhancing throughput in next-generation Wi-Fi within dense overlapping basic service sets. However, existing MAPC protocols rely on static, protocol-defined rules, which limits their ability to adapt to dynamic network conditions such as varying interference levels and topologies. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Agentic AI Wi-Fi framework where each access point, modeled as an autonomous large language model agent, collaboratively reasons about the network state and negotiates adaptive coordination strategies in real time. This dynamic collaboration is achieved through a cognitive workflow that enables the agents to engage in natural language dialogue, leveraging integrated memory, reflection, and tool use to ground their decisions in past experience and environmental feedback. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that our agentic framework successfully learns to adapt to diverse and dynamic network environments, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art spatial reuse baseline and validating its potential as a robust and intelligent solution for future wireless networks.

TL;DR: OpenApps是一个轻量级开源生态系统，用于评估UI智能体在不同应用变体中的可靠性。研究发现，虽然智能体在固定应用中的表现相对稳定，但在不同应用变体中的成功率波动可达50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法依赖固定环境，无法衡量智能体在不同应用设计和内容变体中的可靠性。为解决这一盲点，需要开发能够生成数千个应用变体的评估平台。

Method: 开发OpenApps生态系统，包含6个可配置应用（消息、日历、地图等），仅需单个CPU即可运行数千个应用版本。进行了超过10,000次独立评估，研究7个领先多模态智能体的可靠性。

Result: 智能体在不同应用变体中的任务成功率波动显著，例如Kimi-VL-3B的平均成功率从63%降至4%。智能体行为（如循环或幻觉操作）也随环境配置而大幅变化。

Conclusion: 评估智能体可靠性时，必须考虑应用变体这一新维度。OpenApps为这一评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Reliability is key to realizing the promise of autonomous UI-Agents, multimodal agents that directly interact with apps in the same manner as humans, as users must be able to trust an agent to complete a given task. Current evaluations rely on fixed environments, often clones of existing apps, which are limited in that they can only shed light on whether or how often an agent can complete a task within a specific environment. When deployed however, agents are likely to encounter variations in app design and content that can affect an agent's ability to complete a task. To address this blind spot of measuring agent reliability across app variations, we develop OpenApps, a light-weight open-source ecosystem with six apps (messenger, calendar, maps, etc.) that are configurable in appearance and content. OpenApps requires just a single CPU to run, enabling easy generation and deployment of thousands of versions of each app. Specifically, we run more than 10,000 independent evaluations to study reliability across seven leading multimodal agents. We find that while standard reliability within a fixed app is relatively stable, reliability can vary drastically when measured across app variations. Task success rates for many agents can fluctuate by more than $50\%$ across app variations. For example, Kimi-VL-3B's average success across all tasks fluctuates from $63\%$ to just $4\%$ across app versions. We also find agent behaviors such as looping or hallucinating actions can differ drastically depending on the environment configuration. These initial findings highlight the importance of measuring reliability along this new dimension of app variations. OpenApps is available at https://facebookresearch.github.io/OpenApps/

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误或过时的内容，如何在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下高效准确地更新其知识是一个重大挑战，特别是在终身学习环境中需要处理多个编辑而不产生干扰。

Method: RILKE将知识控制视为模型表示空间中的干预，学习具有释义鲁棒性和编辑局部性的模块，将每个更新限制在低维子空间以减少交叉编辑干扰，并通过查询自适应路由器在推理时选择合适的模块来指导生成。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型的知识编辑基准评估中，RILKE能够扩展到大规模数据集，表现出高编辑成功率、强释义泛化能力，并在保持通用效用的同时具有适度的内存开销。

Conclusion: RILKE是LLM中终身知识控制的有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated content. Updating their knowledge efficiently and accurately without costly retraining is a major challenge. This problem is especially hard for complex, unstructured knowledge in a lifelong setting, where many edits must coexist without interference. We introduce RILKE (Representation Intervention for Lifelong KnowledgE Control), a robust and scalable method that treats knowledge control as interventions within the model's representation space. Leveraging representation-space expressiveness, we identify two properties enabling RILKE to deliver fine-grained control over complex, unstructured knowledge while maintaining general utility with frozen base weights. During training, RILKE learns paraphrase-robust and edit-localized modules that limit each update to a low-dimensional subspace to minimize cross-edit interference. In inference, a query-adaptive router selects the appropriate module to guide the model's generation. In evaluation on knowledge editing benchmarks with LLaMA and Qwen models, RILKE is scalable to large-scale datasets, demonstrating high edit success, strong paraphrase generalization, and preserving general utility with modest memory overhead. These results show RILKE is an effective and scalable solution for lifelong knowledge control in LLMs.

Abstract: While neurons are the basic units of deep neural networks, it is still unclear what they learn and if their knowledge is aligned with that of humans. Compositional explanations aim to answer this question by describing the spatial alignment between neuron activations and concepts through logical rules. These logical descriptions are typically computed via a search over all possible concept combinations. Since computing the spatial alignment over the entire state space is computationally infeasible, the literature commonly adopts beam search to restrict the space. However, beam search cannot provide any theoretical guarantees of optimality, and it remains unclear how close current explanations are to the true optimum. In this theoretical paper, we address this gap by introducing the first framework for computing guaranteed optimal compositional explanations. Specifically, we propose: (i) a decomposition that identifies the factors influencing the spatial alignment, (ii) a heuristic to estimate the alignment at any stage of the search, and (iii) the first algorithm that can compute optimal compositional explanations within a feasible time. Using this framework, we analyze the differences between optimal and non-optimal explanations in the most popular settings for compositional explanations, the computer vision domain and Convolutional Neural Networks. In these settings, we demonstrate that 10-40 percent of explanations obtained with beam search are suboptimal when overlapping concepts are involved. Finally, we evaluate a beam-search variant guided by our proposed decomposition and heuristic, showing that it matches or improves runtime over prior methods while offering greater flexibility in hyperparameters and computational resources.

Method: 将具身认知评估构建为部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中的世界建模问题，使用来自机器人仿真(BEHAVIOR)的可扩展流水线合成QA对，包含8,972个QA对，涵盖长时程家庭规模活动。

Result: 实验显示前沿视觉语言模型与人类之间存在性能差距，且随着交互时程延长而扩大。模型在逆向任务上表现优于前向任务，并表现出以人类为中心的偏见。

Conclusion: ENACT基准揭示了当前视觉语言模型在具身认知能力上的局限性，为未来具身AI研究提供了重要评估工具。

Abstract: Embodied cognition argues that intelligence arises from sensorimotor interaction rather than passive observation. It raises an intriguing question: do modern vision-language models (VLMs), trained largely in a disembodied manner, exhibit signs of embodied cognition? We introduce ENACT, a benchmark that casts evaluation of embodied cognition as world modeling from egocentric interaction in a visual question answering (VQA) format. Framed as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose actions are scene graph changes, ENACT comprises two complementary sequence reordering tasks: forward world modeling (reorder shuffled observations given actions) and inverse world modeling (reorder shuffled actions given observations). While conceptually simple, solving these tasks implicitly demands capabilities central to embodied cognition-affordance recognition, action-effect reasoning, embodied awareness, and interactive, long-horizon memory from partially observable egocentric input, while avoiding low-level image synthesis that could confound the evaluation. We provide a scalable pipeline that synthesizes QA pairs from robotics simulation (BEHAVIOR) and evaluates models on 8,972 QA pairs spanning long-horizon home-scale activities. Experiments reveal a performance gap between frontier VLMs and humans that widens with interaction horizon. Models consistently perform better on the inverse task than the forward one and exhibit anthropocentric biases, including a preference for right-handed actions and degradation when camera intrinsics or viewpoints deviate from human vision.

TL;DR: Ivy是一个AI教练系统，通过结合符号化TMK模型和生成式解释层，提供结构化多步骤解释，改善LLM生成解释的深度和结构质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在程序性技能学习中生成流畅但浅层解释的问题，需要传达步骤背后的因果、目标导向和组合逻辑。

Method: 结合符号化任务-方法-知识（TMK）模型与生成式解释层，TMK编码因果转换、目标层次和问题分解，在明确结构边界内指导LLM构建解释。

Result: 与GPT和检索增强GPT基线相比，符号约束显著提高了对"如何"和"为什么"问题解释的结构质量。

Conclusion: 展示了可扩展的AI教育方法，通过符号约束增强AI生成解释在教学辅导系统中的教育价值。

Abstract: In procedural skill learning, instructional explanations must convey not just steps, but the causal, goal-directed, and compositional logic behind them. Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet shallow responses that miss this structure. We present Ivy, an AI coaching system that delivers structured, multi-step explanations by combining symbolic Task-Method-Knowledge (TMK) models with a generative interpretation layer-an LLM that constructs explanations while being constrained by TMK structure. TMK encodes causal transitions, goal hierarchies, and problem decompositions, and guides the LLM within explicit structural bounds. We evaluate Ivy against responses against GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT baselines using expert and independent annotations across three inferential dimensions. Results show that symbolic constraints consistently improve the structural quality of explanations for "how" and "why" questions. This study demonstrates a scalable AI for education approach that strengthens the pedagogical value of AI-generated explanations in intelligent coaching systems.

*Jinpeng Wang,Chao Li,Ting Ye,Mengyuan Zhang,Wei Liu,Jian Luan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ICPO方法，通过利用LLM生成不同响应的概率来反映其推理过程的自我评估，结合偏好优势分数和可验证奖励来改进强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在粗粒度奖励、奖励噪声和低效探索等问题，导致训练不稳定和熵崩溃。

Method: ICPO计算每个响应的偏好优势分数，通过比较同一输入提示下多个响应的相对生成概率，并将该分数与可验证奖励结合来指导探索过程。

Result: 在四个通用领域基准和三个数学基准上的实验表明，ICPO相比GRPO能稳定提升推理能力。

Conclusion: ICPO有效缓解了粗粒度奖励和奖励噪声问题，抑制过度自信错误，增强被低估高质量响应的相对优势，防止模型过拟合特定策略，促进更彻底的探索。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.

*Linze Chen,Yufan Cai,Zhe Hou,Jinsong Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L4M是一个结合对抗性LLM代理和SMT求解器验证的法律推理框架，将自然语言解释的灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合，在公共基准测试中超越了先进LLM和法律AI基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的系统擅长表面文本分析，但缺乏原则性法理学所需的保证。法律理性表现为实质理性（关注结果公平性）和形式理性（要求遵循明确规则），需要将自然语言的解释灵活性与符号验证的严谨性相结合。

Method: 采用三阶段流水线：1) 法规形式化：将法律条款转换为逻辑公式；2) 双重事实和法规提取：检察官和辩护方对齐的LLM独立映射案例叙述；3) 求解器中心裁决：将双方论点编译为逻辑约束，通过不满足核心触发迭代自我批判，最终由法官LLM将可满足公式转化为透明判决。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，该系统超越了GPT-4-mini、DeepSeek-V3和Claude 4等先进LLM以及最先进的法律AI基线，同时提供严格且可解释的符号论证。

Conclusion: L4M框架成功地将对抗性LLM代理与SMT求解器验证相结合，为法律推理提供了既灵活又严谨的解决方案，在性能和可解释性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: The rationality of law manifests in two forms: substantive rationality, which concerns the fairness or moral desirability of outcomes, and formal rationality, which requires legal decisions to follow explicitly stated, general, and logically coherent rules. Existing LLM-based systems excel at surface-level text analysis but lack the guarantees required for principled jurisprudence. We introduce L4M, a novel framework that combines adversarial LLM agents with SMT-solver-backed proofs to unite the interpretive flexibility of natural language with the rigor of symbolic verification. The pipeline consists of three phases: (1) Statute Formalization, where domain-specific prompts convert legal provisions into logical formulae; (2) Dual Fact and Statute Extraction, in which prosecutor- and defense-aligned LLMs independently map case narratives to fact tuples and statutes, ensuring role isolation; and (3) Solver-Centric Adjudication, where an autoformalizer compiles both parties' arguments into logic constraints, and unsat cores trigger iterative self-critique until a satisfiable formula is achieved, which is then verbalized by a Judge-LLM into a transparent verdict and optimized sentence. Experimental results on public benchmarks show that our system surpasses advanced LLMs including GPT-o4-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and Claude 4 as well as state-of-the-art Legal AI baselines, while providing rigorous and explainable symbolic justifications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OVOD-Agent将开放词汇目标检测从被动的类别匹配转变为主动的视觉推理和自我演化检测，通过视觉思维链和弱马尔可夫决策过程提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇目标检测方法虽然在多模态数据上预训练，但推理仍局限于固定类别名称，造成多模态训练与单模态推理之间的差距。文本空间的潜力尚未充分挖掘。

Method: 提出OVOD-Agent框架，采用视觉思维链范式，将文本优化过程扩展为可解释的视觉推理。通过弱马尔可夫决策过程建模视觉上下文转换，使用Bandit模块生成探索信号，并结合马尔可夫转移矩阵与Bandit轨迹进行自监督奖励模型优化。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS数据集上的实验表明，OVOD-Agent在各种OVOD骨干网络上均能提供一致性能提升，特别是在稀有类别上表现突出。

Conclusion: OVOD-Agent框架通过主动视觉推理和自我演化检测机制，有效提升了开放词汇目标检测的性能，特别是在处理稀有类别时表现出色。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to enable detectors to generalize across categories by leveraging semantic information. Although existing methods are pretrained on large vision-language datasets, their inference is still limited to fixed category names, creating a gap between multimodal training and unimodal inference. Previous work has shown that improving textual representation can significantly enhance OVOD performance, indicating that the textual space is still underexplored. To this end, we propose OVOD-Agent, which transforms passive category matching into proactive visual reasoning and self-evolving detection. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) paradigm, OVOD-Agent extends the textual optimization process into an interpretable Visual-CoT with explicit actions. OVOD's lightweight nature makes LLM-based management unsuitable; instead, we model visual context transitions as a Weakly Markovian Decision Process (w-MDP) over eight state spaces, which naturally represents the agent's state, memory, and interaction dynamics. A Bandit module generates exploration signals under limited supervision, helping the agent focus on uncertain regions and adapt its detection policy. We further integrate Markov transition matrices with Bandit trajectories for self-supervised Reward Model (RM) optimization, forming a closed loop from Bandit exploration to RM learning. Experiments on COCO and LVIS show that OVOD-Agent provides consistent improvements across OVOD backbones, particularly on rare categories, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Joseph Y. Halpern,Rafael Pass*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Halpern-Pearl因果定义的抽象版本，使其能应用于任何定义了反事实的模型，扩展了因果关系的适用范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Halpern-Pearl的因果定义局限于因果模型，无法处理包含析取、否定、信念和嵌套反事实的复杂公式，需要更通用的定义框架。

Method: 通过抽象化Halpern-Pearl因果定义的关键特征，构建一个能在任何定义了反事实的模型中应用的通用因果定义框架。

Result: 新定义不仅能应用于更广泛的模型（包括允许回溯的模型），还能处理复杂逻辑公式的因果关系分析，并扩展到解释的定义。

Conclusion: 抽象化方法扩展了因果关系的应用范围，提供了对因果定义更深层次的理解，并为跨模型的解释理论奠定了基础。

Abstract: Perhaps the most prominent current definition of (actual) causality is due to Halpern and Pearl.  It is defined using causal models (also known as structural equations models).  We abstract the definition, extracting its key features, so that it can be applied to any other model where counterfactuals are defined. By abstracting the definition, we gain a number of benefits. Not only can we apply the definition in a wider range of models, including ones that allow, for example, backtracking, but we can apply the definition to determine if A is a cause of B  even if A and B are formulas involving disjunctions, negations, beliefs, and nested counterfactuals (none of which can be handled by the Halpern-Pearl definition). Moreover, we can extend the ideas to getting an abstract definition of explanation that can be applied beyond causal models. Finally, we gain a deeper understanding of features of the definition  even in causal models.

### [181] [Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398)
*Jiayuan Zhang,Kaiquan Chen,Zhihao Lu,Enshen Zhou,Qian Yu,Jing Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Prune4Web是一种新的网页自动化方法，通过将DOM处理从LLM读取转向程序化剪枝，大幅减少候选元素数量（25-50倍），在低级别定位任务中准确率从46.8%提升到88.28%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM网页代理在处理复杂网页时面临DOM结构过大（1万-10万token）的问题，现有方法要么粗暴截断DOM丢失关键信息，要么使用低效启发式方法，无法在精度和可扩展性之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出DOM树剪枝编程范式，让LLM生成可执行的Python评分脚本来动态过滤DOM元素，基于分解子任务的语义线索。该方法将遍历和评分委托给轻量级可解释程序，避免LLM直接处理原始大DOM。

Result: 在低级别定位任务上准确率从46.8%大幅提升至88.28%，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: Prune4Web通过程序化剪枝方法有效解决了网页自动化中的DOM处理瓶颈，在保持精度的同时显著提升了处理效率。

Abstract: Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统药物重定位预测需要多领域专家协作，但现有工具碎片化且数据异构，难以整合到工作流中。需要开发能让临床专家直接使用的系统。

Method: 基于NeDRex知识图谱构建多智能体系统，包括查询路由、数据检索、算法执行、结果可视化等专门智能体，支持网络分析和功能一致性评估。

Result: 系统实现了自然语言访问生物医学知识图谱，集成多种生物信息学分析工具，支持药物重定位预测和科学文献挖掘。

Conclusion: ChatDRex使临床专家无需计算机专业知识即可进行复杂分析，促进药物重定位发现，加速新疗法开发和个性化医疗发展。

Abstract: Repurposing approved drugs offers a time-efficient and cost-effective alternative to traditional drug development. However, in silico prediction of repurposing candidates is challenging and requires the effective collaboration of specialists in various fields, including pharmacology, medicine, biology, and bioinformatics. Fragmented, specialized algorithms and tools often address only narrow aspects of the overall problem, and heterogeneous, unstructured data landscapes require specialized users to be involved. Hence, these data services do not integrate smoothly across workflows. With ChatDRex, we present a conversation-based, multi-agent system that facilitates the execution of complex bioinformatic analyses aiming for network-based drug repurposing prediction. It builds on the integrated systems medicine knowledge graph NeDRex. ChatDRex provides natural language access to its extensive biomedical KG and integrates bioinformatics agents for network analysis and drug repurposing, complemented by agents for functional coherence evaluation for in silico validation, as well as agents for literature mining and for discussing the obtained results in a scientific context. Its flexible multi-agent design assigns specific tasks to specialized agents, including query routing, data retrieval, algorithm execution, and result visualization. A dedicated reasoning module keeps the user in the loop and allows for hallucination detection. By enabling physicians and researchers without computer science expertise to control complex analyses in natural language, ChatDRex democratizes access to bioinformatics as an important resource for drug repurposing. It enables clinical experts to generate hypotheses and explore drug repurposing opportunities, ultimately accelerating the discovery of novel therapies and advancing personalized medicine and translational research.

Conclusion: EWE标志着向自动科学发现迈出的一步，有望民主化专业知识和智力资源，特别对易受极端天气影响的发展中国家具有重要意义。

Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.

Motivation: 解决现有方法计算成本高或过度拒绝安全指令的问题，确保具身AI在家庭环境中的安全部署。

Method: 使用多个LLM智能体辩论指令安全性，由关键评估器基于逻辑性、风险识别、证据质量和清晰度评分，通过迭代审议和共识投票达成决策。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和VirtualHome实验中，对不安全任务的拒绝率超过90%，同时保持低安全任务拒绝率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展、模型无关的解决方案，用于构建可信赖的具身智能体。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of embodied AI agents during task planning is critical for real-world deployment, especially in household environments where dangerous instructions pose significant risks. Existing methods often suffer from either high computational costs due to preference alignment training or over-rejection when using single-agent safety prompts. To address these limitations, we propose MADRA, a training-free Multi-Agent Debate Risk Assessment framework that leverages collective reasoning to enhance safety awareness without sacrificing task performance. MADRA employs multiple LLM-based agents to debate the safety of a given instruction, guided by a critical evaluator that scores responses based on logical soundness, risk identification, evidence quality, and clarity. Through iterative deliberation and consensus voting, MADRA significantly reduces false rejections while maintaining high sensitivity to dangerous tasks. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical cognitive collaborative planning framework that integrates safety, memory, planning, and self-evolution mechanisms to improve task success rates through continuous learning. We also contribute SafeAware-VH, a benchmark dataset for safety-aware task planning in VirtualHome, containing 800 annotated instructions. Extensive experiments on AI2-THOR and VirtualHome demonstrate that our approach achieves over 90% rejection of unsafe tasks while ensuring that safe-task rejection is low, outperforming existing methods in both safety and execution efficiency. Our work provides a scalable, model-agnostic solution for building trustworthy embodied agents.

Motivation: 现有基准测试往往过度简化空间认知，将其简化为单一维度指标，无法捕捉空间能力的层次结构和相互依赖关系。

Method: 构建了分层空间认知框架（五个认知层次），开发了SpatialBench大规模细粒度基准（涵盖15个任务），并引入了高层能力导向的统一评估指标。

Result: 实验发现模型在不同认知层次上表现分层：感知基础能力强，但在符号推理、因果推断和规划方面仍有局限；人类测试显示人类进行选择性、目标导向的抽象，而MLLMs倾向于过度关注表面细节。

Conclusion: 建立了首个系统测量MLLMs分层空间认知的框架，为未来空间智能系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Spatial cognition is fundamental to real-world multimodal intelligence, allowing models to effectively interact with the physical environment. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant strides, existing benchmarks often oversimplify spatial cognition, reducing it to a single-dimensional metric, which fails to capture the hierarchical structure and interdependence of spatial abilities. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical spatial cognition framework that decomposes spatial intelligence into five progressively complex levels from basic observation to high-level planning. Building upon this taxonomy, we construct SpatialBench, a large-scale, fine-grained benchmark covering 15 tasks aligned with these cognitive levels. To provide a unified evaluation across heterogeneous tasks, we further introduce a high-level capability-oriented metric that reliably assesses a model's overall spatial reasoning ability. Extensive experiments over massive MLLMs reveal distinct performance stratification across cognitive levels: models exhibit strong perceptual grounding yet remain limited in symbolic reasoning, causal inference, and planning. Additional human tests demonstrate that humans perform selective, goal-directed abstraction, while MLLMs tend to over-attend to surface details without coherent spatial intent. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for measuring hierarchical spatial cognition in MLLMs, laying the foundation for future spatially intelligent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有验证性能的关键限制在于错误检测能力，需要改进开放数学问题的验证方法。

Method: 设计悲观验证变体，为同一证明构建多个并行验证，只要任一验证报告错误就判定证明不正确。

Result: 该方法在多个数学验证基准上显著提升性能，计算资源消耗少，甚至超越了扩展长链思维在测试时扩展中的标记效率。

Conclusion: 悲观验证能有效提升语言模型输出的可靠性和性能，在实现长视野数学任务中发挥关键作用，有助于增强语言模型的数学能力。

Abstract: The key limitation of the verification performance lies in the ability of error detection. With this intuition we designed several variants of pessimistic verification, which are simple workflows that could significantly improve the verification of open-ended math questions. In pessimistic verification we construct multiple parallel verifications for the same proof, and the proof is deemed incorrect if any one of them reports an error. This simple technique significantly improves the performance across many math verification benchmarks without incurring substantial computational resources. Its token efficiency even surpassed extended long-CoT in test-time scaling. Our case studies further indicate that the majority of false negatives in stronger models are actually caused by annotation errors in the original dataset, so our method's performance is in fact underestimated. Self-verification for mathematical problems can effectively improve the reliability and performance of language model outputs, and it also plays a critical role in enabling long-horizon mathematical tasks. We believe that research on pessimistic verification will help enhance the mathematical capabilities of language models across a wide range of tasks.

TL;DR: 语言模型在专业角色扮演中表现出显著的身份披露不一致性，特别是在高风险领域，这可能导致用户过度信任并产生安全隐患。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估语言模型在专业角色扮演中能否可靠地披露其AI身份，因为如果模型无法在专家环境中透明地表明其能力边界，用户可能会错误地信任其专业能力，从而在高风险领域造成潜在危害。

Method: 采用共同花园设计，对16个开放权重模型（4B-671B参数）进行了19,200次试验审计，评估不同专业角色下的身份披露行为，并使用贝叶斯验证和Rogan-Gladen校正确保结果稳健性。

Result: 模型在不同专业领域表现出显著的不一致性：金融顾问角色初始披露率为30.8%，而神经外科医生角色仅为3.5%。披露率范围从2.8%到73.6%，模型身份比参数数量更能预测行为。推理优化在某些模型中主动抑制了自我透明度。

Conclusion: 透明度反映的是训练因素而非模型规模，组织不能假设安全属性会转移到部署环境中，需要刻意设计行为和进行经验验证。

Abstract: If a language model cannot reliably disclose its AI identity in expert contexts, users cannot trust its competence boundaries. This study examines self-transparency in models assigned professional personas within high-stakes domains where false expertise risks user harm. Using a common-garden design, sixteen open-weight models (4B--671B parameters) were audited across 19,200 trials. Models exhibited sharp domain-specific inconsistency: a Financial Advisor persona elicited 30.8% disclosure initially, while a Neurosurgeon persona elicited only 3.5%. This creates preconditions for a "Reverse Gell-Mann Amnesia" effect, where transparency in some domains leads users to overgeneralize trust to contexts where disclosure fails. Disclosure ranged from 2.8% to 73.6%, with a 14B model reaching 61.4% while a 70B produced just 4.1%. Model identity predicted behavior better than parameter count ($ΔR_{adj}^{2} = 0.359$ vs 0.018). Reasoning optimization actively suppressed self-transparency in some models, with reasoning variants showing up to 48.4% lower disclosure than base counterparts. Bayesian validation with Rogan--Gladen correction confirmed robustness to measurement error ($κ= 0.908$). These findings demonstrate transparency reflects training factors rather than scale. Organizations cannot assume safety properties transfer to deployment contexts, requiring deliberate behavior design and empirical verification.

Abstract: In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and complex global challenges, responsible foresight has emerged as an essential framework for policymakers aiming to navigate future uncertainties and shape the future. Responsible foresight entails the ethical anticipation of emerging opportunities and risks, with a focus on fostering proactive, sustainable, and accountable future design. This paper coins the term "responsible computational foresight", examining the role of human-centric artificial intelligence and computational modeling in advancing responsible foresight, establishing a set of foundational principles for this new field and presenting a suite of AI-driven foresight tools currently shaping it. AI, particularly in conjunction with simulations and scenario analysis, enhances policymakers' ability to address uncertainty, evaluate risks, and devise strategies geared toward sustainable, resilient futures. However, responsible foresight extends beyond mere technical forecasting; it demands a nuanced understanding of the interdependencies within social, environmental, economic and political systems, alongside a commitment to ethical, long-term decision-making that supports human intelligence. We argue that AI will play a role as a supportive tool in responsible, human-centered foresight, complementing rather than substituting policymaker judgment to enable the proactive shaping of resilient and ethically sound futures. This paper advocates for the thoughtful integration of AI into foresight practices to empower policymakers and communities as they confront the grand challenges of the 21st century.

TL;DR: LLMs在8拼图任务中表现出严重的规划和状态跟踪缺陷，即使有外部验证器提供有效移动，也无法解决任何谜题。主要问题是脆弱的状态表示和弱启发式规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在没有代码执行或其他工具辅助下的规划和状态推理能力，使用8拼图这一经典任务进行精确评估。

Method: 测试四种模型在常见提示条件（零样本、思维链、算法思维）和分级纠正反馈下的表现，并使用外部移动验证器提供仅有效移动的辅助。

Result: 反馈提高了某些模型-提示组合的成功率，但成功运行通常冗长且计算昂贵。即使有外部验证器，所有模型都无法解决任何谜题。定性分析揭示了两个主要缺陷：脆弱的状态表示和弱启发式规划。

Conclusion: 在没有外部工具的情况下，当前LLMs在规划方面存在重大限制，进一步进展可能需要维护显式状态和执行结构化搜索的机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results on many benchmarks, yet their capacity for planning and stateful reasoning remains unclear. We study these abilities directly, without code execution or other tools, using the 8-puzzle: a classic task that requires state tracking and goal-directed planning while allowing precise, step-by-step evaluation. Four models are tested under common prompting conditions (Zero-Shot, Chain-of-Thought, Algorithm-of-Thought) and with tiered corrective feedback. Feedback improves success rates for some model-prompt combinations, but many successful runs are long, computationally expensive, and indirect. We then examine the models with an external move validator that provides only valid moves. Despite this level of assistance, none of the models solve any puzzles in this setting. Qualitative analysis reveals two dominant deficits across all models: (1) brittle internal state representations, leading to frequent invalid moves, and (2) weak heuristic planning, with models entering loops or selecting actions that do not reduce the distance to the goal state. These findings indicate that, in the absence of external tools such as code interpreters, current LLMs have substantial limitations in planning and that further progress may require mechanisms for maintaining explicit state and performing structured search.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI/ML模型在解决未解决问题时可能放大人类偏见，需要更丰富的因果模型来指导负责任AI/ML的发展，但不同方法基于不同假设难以整合。

Method: 将系统动力学和结构方程建模整合到一个共同的数学框架中，能够从分布生成系统、开发方法并比较结果。

Result: 建立了一个统一框架，可以支持系统动力学在数据科学和AI/ML应用中的认识论基础。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于克服不同方法间假设差异的障碍，为负责任AI/ML的发展提供更好的理论基础。

Abstract: AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing together methods rooted in different underlying assumptions (i.e., Dana Meadow's "the unavoidable a priori"). This paper brings system dynamics and structural equation modeling together into a common mathematical framework that can be used to generate systems from distributions, develop methods, and compare results to inform the underlying epistemology of system dynamics for data science and AI/ML applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于轨迹的记忆方法存在简洁性偏差，会逐渐丢失关键领域知识，且仅记录单模态行为轨迹，无法保留视觉注意力和逻辑推理如何共同促成解决方案，这与人类多模态整合的语义记忆方式不符。

Method: 采用双流记忆框架，分别编码视觉分心模式和逻辑推理错误，遵循增长-精炼原则逐步积累和更新多模态语义知识，保持稳定可泛化策略同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，ViLoMem持续提高了pass@1准确率，显著减少了重复的视觉和逻辑错误。消融实验证实了双流记忆和明确分心-幻觉分离的必要性。

Conclusion: 错误感知的多模态记忆对于终身和跨领域智能体学习具有重要价值，ViLoMem框架有效提升了多模态推理性能。

Abstract: MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings, it records only a single-modality trace of past behavior, failing to preserve how visual attention and logical reasoning jointly contributed to the solution. This is fundamentally misaligned with human cognition: semantic memory is both multimodal and integrated, preserving visual and abstract knowledge through coordinated but distinct representational streams. We thus introduce ViLoMem, a dual-stream memory framework that constructs compact, schema-based memory. It separately encodes visual distraction patterns and logical reasoning errors, enabling MLLMs to learn from their successful and failed experiences. Following a grow-and-refine principle, the system incrementally accumulates and updates multimodal semantic knowledge -- preserving stable, generalizable strategies while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Across six multimodal benchmarks, ViLoMem consistently improves pass@1 accuracy and substantially reduces repeated visual and logical errors. Ablations confirm the necessity of dual-stream memory with explicit distraction--hallucination separation, demonstrating the value of error-aware multimodal memory for lifelong and cross-domain agentic learning.

Abstract: Efficient and scalable 3D surface reconstruction from range data remains a core challenge in computer graphics and vision, particularly in real-time and resource-constrained scenarios. Traditional volumetric methods based on fixed-resolution voxel grids or hierarchical structures like octrees often suffer from memory inefficiency, computational overhead, and a lack of GPU support. We propose a novel variance-adaptive, multi-resolution voxel grid that dynamically adjusts voxel size based on the local variance of signed distance field (SDF) observations. Unlike prior multi-resolution approaches that rely on recursive octree structures, our method leverages a flat spatial hash table to store all voxel blocks, supporting constant-time access and full GPU parallelism. This design enables high memory efficiency and real-time scalability. We further demonstrate how our representation supports GPU-accelerated rendering through a parallel quad-tree structure for Gaussian Splatting, enabling effective control over splat density. Our open-source CUDA/C++ implementation achieves up to 13x speedup and 4x lower memory usage compared to fixed-resolution baselines, while maintaining on par results in terms of reconstruction accuracy, offering a practical and extensible solution for high-performance 3D reconstruction.
