TL;DR: 提出一种改进Kaguya TC图像生成3D月球地图质量的方法，通过减少压缩引起的视差图噪声来提升高程精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着月球探索任务增加，需要高质量3D月球地图，特别是NASA Endurance任务需要穿越2000公里。Kaguya TC图像存在立体匹配误差和JPEG压缩伪影导致的高程不准确问题

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式（尤其在暗区），提出减少压缩图像视差图中残留噪声的方法

Result: 实验结果显示该方法有效减少高程噪声，提升地形数据的安全性和可靠性

Conclusion: 该方法能够改善3D月球地图质量，为未来月球任务提供更可靠的地形数据

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Uncertainty Matters in Dynamic Gaussian Splatting for Monocular 4D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12768)
*Fengzhi Guo,Chih-Chuan Hsu,Sihao Ding,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过估计每个高斯的时间变化不确定性并构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，提升4D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了观测质量差异，导致遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成质量下降。

Method: 引入时间变化的每个高斯不确定性估计，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠的运动线索传播到整个场景。

Result: 在多种真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性一致地改善了动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量的合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知是提升动态高斯泼溅性能的关键，USplat4D框架通过传播可靠运动线索有效解决了遮挡和极端视角下的重建问题。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

### [3] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP在VLM中表现优于DINO，但优势主要来自语言监督而非训练数据量。在相同条件下对比发现，CLIP擅长语义理解，DINO更关注低级视觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在VLM中优于自监督模型DINO的原因，是源于语言监督还是训练数据量的差异。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，分析嵌入特征并集成到VLM中评估20个VQA基准。

Result: CLIP擅长文本密集型任务，DINO在视觉中心任务上略优；语言监督变体带来的提升有限。

Conclusion: 语言监督使CLIP学习到更高级的语义表示，这对VLM性能有重要影响，为视觉编码器设计提供了科学见解。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

### [4] [MVP4D: Multi-View Portrait Video Diffusion for Animatable 4D Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12785)
*Felix Taubner,Ruihang Zhang,Mathieu Tuli,Sherwin Bahmani,David B. Lindell*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVP4D是一个基于扩散模型的视频生成系统，能够从单张参考图像生成可动画化的多视角数字人视频，并蒸馏成实时渲染的4D虚拟化身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人虚拟化身的过程昂贵耗时，需要复杂的相机捕捉设备和专业3D艺术家的大量手动工作。现有基于单张图像的方法虽然降低了门槛，但缺乏多视角信息约束，在偏离参考视角时质量会下降。

Method: 基于预训练的视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情生成多视角视频（最多360度环绕），然后将输出蒸馏成可实时渲染的4D虚拟化身。

Result: 相比之前的方法，显著提高了生成虚拟化身的真实感、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持易用性的同时，通过多视角生成和4D蒸馏技术，显著提升了数字人虚拟化身的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在通用领域已成功应用，但在医学影像中由于数据有限和领域特定偏差而未被充分利用。

Method: 引入乳腺组织感知数据增强采样器进行图像级和补丁级监督，以及利用3D DBT结构的跨切片对比学习目标。

Result: 在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中达到最先进性能，并在五个基准数据集上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为乳腺X线摄影提供了一个可扩展、无需标注的多用途计算机辅助诊断工具基础，有助于减轻放射科医生工作量并提高乳腺癌筛查诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

TL;DR: 提出双模型框架，分别优化VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL在交通视频理解中的captioning和VQA任务，通过分离训练减少任务干扰，在AI City Challenge Track 2中取得第10名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通视频安全分析需要细粒度行为模式识别和全面描述生成，现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用双模型框架，VideoLLaMA专门处理时间推理任务，Qwen2.5-VL专门处理视觉理解任务，通过分离训练策略优化各自性能。

Result: VideoLLaMA在时间推理上CIDEr得分1.1001，Qwen2.5-VL在VQA准确率达60.80%，在AI City Challenge Track 2中S2得分45.7572排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略有效减少任务干扰，比联合训练在VQA准确率上提升8.6%，同时保持captioning质量，证明任务专业化的重要性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [7] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PanoTPS-Net模型，通过CNN和TPS空间变换从单张全景图像估计3D房间布局，支持立方体和非立方体布局，在多个数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在机器人、增强现实和室内设计等领域有重要应用价值，需要能够处理各种复杂布局的有效方法。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：首先用CNN提取图像特征并学习TPS变换参数，然后用TPS空间变换层将参考布局变形为目标布局。

Result: 在PanoContext、Stanford-2D3D、Matterport3DLayout和ZInD数据集上分别达到85.49、86.16、81.76和91.98的3DIoU值，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanoTPS-Net在房间布局估计方面表现出高精度和强泛化能力，证明了TPS变换与全景图像的兼容性，能有效处理各种复杂布局。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门的空间推理框架，通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示中，增强模型对物体几何和布局的理解能力，在仓库环境中实现了有效的空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在大规模3D仓库环境中面临场景杂乱、遮挡和需要精确空间理解的挑战，主要依赖局部外观而缺乏明确的空间基础，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 将掩码维度以边界框坐标形式直接嵌入输入提示中，在四个问题类别上进行任务特定的微调，并在训练集中向GPT响应添加规范化答案以提高与评估系统的一致性。

Result: 在公共排行榜上获得最终得分73.0606，排名第4位。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面具有有效性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [9] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers虽然性能优异，但其复杂的注意力机制给可解释性带来挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer等不同架构和预训练策略，在血液细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM产生类别区分性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在错误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，这项研究支持将Vision Transformers可靠且可解释地集成到关键的医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

TL;DR: 提出APGNet网络用于水下伪装目标检测，通过自适应先验引导机制和双分支架构解决水下图像退化与生物伪装问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临水下图像退化（低对比度、颜色失真）和海洋生物自然伪装两大挑战，传统图像增强技术难以恢复关键特征，陆地场景的COD方法缺乏对水下光学特性的考虑

Method: APGNet采用双分支架构，使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强生成光照不变图像，设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器，提出自适应先验引导机制分层融合位置和边界先验

Result: 在两个公共MAS数据集上的实验表明，APGNet在广泛使用的评估指标下优于15种最先进方法

Conclusion: APGNet通过自适应先验引导机制有效解决了水下伪装目标检测的挑战，在水下环境中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: VidMP3是一种新的视频编辑方法，通过利用姿态和位置先验学习源视频的广义运动表示，能够在保持原始运动的同时实现结构和语义的灵活编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的视频编辑方法在结构保持任务上表现良好，但在结构可变编辑方面存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移和需要人工干预等问题。

Method: 利用姿态和位置先验从源视频学习广义运动表示，生成保持原始运动但允许结构和语义灵活性的新视频。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3能够有效解决运动保持视频编辑中的挑战，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Conclusion: 领域自适应是解决计算机视觉中标注数据稀缺问题的有效方法，能够实现跨领域的数据预测。

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此构建EG-Restormer处理严重模糊；设计轻量高效的LENet处理轻微模糊；集成两者形成自适应双网络(ADNet)根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在解码率和速度方面均达到最先进性能，特别适合资源受限的移动设备。

Conclusion: 通过显式利用QR码的结构先验和自适应网络选择策略，提出的方法在QR码去模糊任务中实现了优异的解码性能和效率。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用平面结构生成精确深度图的方法，为3D场景重建提供可靠的几何监督，解决了现有方法在观测区域和未观测区域重建质量差、多视角不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练扩散模型的3D场景重建方法存在两个关键局限：缺乏可靠的几何监督导致重建质量差，以及缺乏有效机制缓解生成图像中的多视角不一致问题。

Method: 利用平面结构生成精确度量尺度深度图，在生成流程中融入几何指导来改进可见性掩码估计、引导新视角选择，并使用视频扩散模型增强多视角一致性。

Result: 在Replica、ScanNet++和DeepBlending数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在几何和外观重建方面均优于现有基线，特别是在未观测区域。

Conclusion: 该方法支持单视图输入和无姿态视频，在室内外场景中具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了判别式表示学习(DRL)框架，通过增量并行适配器(IPA)网络和分离锚点监督(DAS)解决非排练类增量学习中的三大挑战：模型复杂度增长、表示空间不连续变化、阶段优化与全局推理不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练模型在非排练类增量学习中的三个核心挑战：模型复杂度随增量阶段增长、增量学习过程中表示空间的不连续变化、阶段优化与全局推理之间的不一致性。

Method: 1. 增量并行适配器(IPA)网络：在预训练模型基础上学习轻量级适配器，通过传输门实现并行连接，保证表示空间的平滑变化。2. 分离锚点监督(DAS)：通过虚拟锚点分别约束正负样本，促进判别式表示学习并对齐不同阶段的特征空间。

Result: 在六个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DRL在整个类增量学习过程中始终优于其他最先进方法，同时在训练和推理阶段都保持高效率。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决了非排练类增量学习中的关键挑战，通过IPA网络和DAS机制实现了表示空间的平滑变化和特征对齐，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSDiff方法，利用预训练扩散模型生成伪参考面部，通过结构引导和颜色精炼的分阶段监督实现老照片人脸修复，在真实老照片数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 老照片人脸修复面临断裂、褪色和严重模糊等多重退化问题，现有基于预训练扩散模型的方法要么依赖显式退化先验，要么使用全局统计指导，难以处理局部伪影和面部颜色问题。

Method: SSDiff方法利用弱引导下预训练扩散模型生成的伪参考面部，这些伪标签具有结构对齐的轮廓和自然颜色。通过分阶段监督：在去噪过程中应用结构引导，在后期步骤进行颜色精炼，并融入人脸解析图和划痕掩码，选择性修复断裂区域。

Result: 构建了包含300张真实老照片的VintageFace基准数据集，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性方面优于现有的GAN和扩散方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督选择性引导扩散方法，有效解决了老照片人脸修复中的多重退化问题，在真实场景下展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Motivation: 检索增强图像生成系统的广泛使用引发了对私有图像数据集未经授权使用的担忧，传统数字水印方法在该系统中存在局限性。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型合成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，通过随机生成的字符序列作为检索密钥进行保护验证。

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中视觉数据集保护问题提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中面临硬件限制（系统带宽、最大激光功率、传感器数据速率等），现有的压缩直方图方法在真实世界照明硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 使用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保编码函数符合硬件约束，包括带宽和峰值功率限制。

Result: 通过广泛仿真验证，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下始终优于传统编码设计，特别是在峰值功率受限系统中优势更明显，并能适应任意参数化脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 提出的约束优化方法能够有效设计实用的编码函数，提升压缩单光子3D成像在真实硬件约束下的性能，特别是在峰值功率受限场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为多模态研究提供了强大且经济高效的视觉描述解决方案，有望推动未来多模态研究发展。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦学习中的异构数据分布和标签偏移问题，为无监督域泛化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

TL;DR: 提出KFF方法用于持续测试时适应，通过知识融合与分裂机制动态管理类感知域知识，解决现有方法中历史知识干扰和新知识学习不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来缓解灾难性遗忘，但会导致新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，造成性能下降。

Method: 提出类感知域知识融合与分裂方法KFF，包含知识分裂模块(KFI)从提示池中分离新域知识，以及知识融合模块(KFU)以最小成本将新知识合并到现有知识池中。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的广泛实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过自适应扩展和合并类感知域知识，能够动态积累判别性历史知识，有效解决CTTA中的知识管理问题。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Motivation: 一次性医学图像分割面临标注数据有限和患者间解剖结构差异大的挑战。传统基于原型的方法通过确定性平均支持特征创建脆弱的表示，无法捕捉对鲁棒泛化至关重要的类内多样性。

Method: DPL包含三个核心创新：(1)基于扩散的原型增强模块，通过前向-反向扩散过程将单个支持原型转换为多样化变体集；(2)空间感知条件机制，利用原型特征统计的几何特性；(3)保守融合策略，在保持原型保真度的同时最大化表示多样性。

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验表明，DPL相比现有方法取得了显著改进，建立了在一次性医学图像分割中的最新技术水平性能。

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型构建重新定义为基于扩散的特征空间探索，成功解决了传统原型方法的局限性，为一次性医学图像分割提供了更鲁棒和多样化的原型表示方法。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕获视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 设计了帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间扩散（IFS）模块来跨帧传播判别性时空信息，通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息来互补传播判别性信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的实验表明，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法性能提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频理解性能，证明了其在视频分类任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and

rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用边界框标注作为弱监督信号，通过师生框架生成伪掩码，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和训练时间问题。


<details>

Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。边界框标注虽然更易获取，但在重叠区域存在歧义。现有两阶段方法通过训练专用伪标签生成器来解决这个问题，但增加了训练时间和复杂性。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均从学生模型更新。引入基于实例中心的查询细化来增强位置查询定位，并设计了查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上的广泛实验表明，BEEP3D在保持计算效率的同时，达到了与最先进弱监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效且有效的端到端解决方案，用于基于边界框监督的3D实例分割，解决了现有方法在训练复杂性和性能之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过视觉注意力对齐有效解决了MLLM知识蒸馏中的视觉感知能力传递问题，具有良好的泛化性

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在计算机视觉领域的进展为物流和制造业优化工作流程提供了新机会，但缺乏专业知识和资源迫使依赖通用模型，而领域特定数据的微调成本高昂且低效，因此使用合成数据进行微调成为经济有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DIANet双流框架，利用相位感知动态图像分别编码起始-顶点和顶点-结束阶段，通过交叉注意力融合模块整合特征，在多个微表情数据集上优于传统单相位方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临面部线索细微短暂、标注数据有限的挑战。传统动态图像方法忽略了微表情不同时间阶段的特性，需要更精细的相位建模。

Method: DIANet双流框架：一个流编码起始到顶点阶段，另一个流捕获顶点到结束阶段，每个流使用专用CNN处理，通过交叉注意力融合模块自适应整合特征。

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法一致优于传统单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进MER提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像和视频生成的推理效率是关键挑战，并行标记预测虽然能大幅减少推理时间，但会因标记不兼容导致结构不一致，且传统方法缺乏回溯修正机制。

Method: 采用新颖的训练方案，在上下文中注入随机标记以提高鲁棒性，并在采样过程中实现标记修正，保持并行标记预测效率的同时提升生成质量。

Result: 在ImageNet-256和CIFAR-10图像生成以及UCF-101和NuScenes视频生成任务上均取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效推理的同时，通过自校正机制显著提升了生成质量，适用于图像和视频两种模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Motivation: 解决红外小目标检测中面临的跨域偏移和异方差噪声扰动双重挑战，传统方法在真实场景中因分布偏差而性能受限。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 小波引导的跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；2) 真实域噪声不变性学习，从目标域提取真实噪声特征构建动态噪声库，通过自监督损失学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个定量指标上优于现有最先进方法，在跨域场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的跨域和噪声挑战，创建了Dynamic-ISTD基准数据集，验证了方法的通用性和优越性能。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用时空一致的代理节点来表示视频中动态变化的对象/场景，克服传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性，支持高质量视频重建和编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示严重依赖不稳定且过细粒度的运动和外观建模先验，如像素级匹配和跟踪。几个像素的跟踪错误就会导致视觉对象表示崩溃，更不用说视频中经常发生的遮挡和大运动。

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，不受累积跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化影响。通过代理节点的动态表示更新机制利用视频的时空先验，处理场景和对象的剧烈变化。采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，所提出的表示方法以更少的参数实现了高视频重建精度，并支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑。

Conclusion: 提出的代理节点表示方法能够克服传统视频表示的脆弱性，在保持高重建质量的同时支持复杂的视频编辑操作，为视频处理提供了更稳定和可控的表示框架。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下优于传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像面临数据稀缺问题（隐私、伦理、标注成本高），而广泛使用的交叉熵和Dice损失的加法组合对超参数敏感，在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失进一步引入置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该方法始终优于调优的加法损失和现有损失函数，在极端数据稀缺情况下提供更稳定的优化。

Conclusion: 该框架为数据受限场景下的鲁棒分割提供了简单、有效且无需超参数调优的机制，特别适用于医学图像分析。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OOD检测方法依赖昂贵的辅助OOD数据集或生成假OOD图像，成本高昂。观察到OOD图像通常与ID图像共享相似的背景区域，因此可以利用ID图像的背景特征作为伪OOD特征进行训练。

Method: 基于卷积的局部不变性，从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟的OOD视觉表示，在训练过程中通过优化降低这些背景特征的L2范数，使神经网络能够缓解对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有良好的组合兼容性，并达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效且低成本的OOD检测解决方案，无需额外的OOD数据集，通过利用ID图像的背景特征成功缓解了模型对OOD数据的过度自信问题。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在参考图像细节不足、亮度不均，以及梯度损失仅关注梯度大小而忽略方向的问题。

Method: 1) 跨模态互补掩码模块学习模态间互补信息；2) 结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化的参考图像合成策略；3) 同时约束梯度大小和方向的角度感知损失。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上的实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时约束梯度大小和方向，在保持纹理强度和正确边缘方向方面表现出色，具有优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLM在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导，该基准已公开可用。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，因为它们采用语义无关的设计，对静态背景和安全关键对象分配相同资源。

Method: 1. 语义引导剪枝与正则化策略：使用混合重要性度量，简化非关键场景元素，同时保留导航关键对象的精细细节。2. 优先级驱动渲染管道：基于优先级的深度预传递，积极剔除被遮挡基元，加速最终着色计算。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS实现了卓越的重建质量（特别是安全关键对象），同时显著减少训练时间，渲染速度超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过注入任务感知的语义优先级，成功解决了动态3D重建中保真度与效率的权衡问题，为自动驾驶应用提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文研究了视觉语言模型在徽标识别中的幻觉问题，发现模型会错误生成品牌名称或文本内容，即使徽标中不包含可见文字。通过系统测试和扰动分析，揭示了模型依赖符号先验而非真实字形感知的问题，并提出了投影器子空间在幻觉中的关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但仍然容易产生幻觉输出，即输出内容缺乏视觉证据支持。本研究特别关注徽标幻觉这一被忽视的问题，即模型在徽标不含可见文字的情况下仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和含文本徽标的精选数据集，以及具有挑战性的Hard-60子集，系统测量领先视觉语言模型的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对开放权重的LLaVA进行嵌入级分析，识别与幻觉相关的投影器维度。

Result: 研究发现幻觉在强烈扭曲下仍然存在，遮挡暴露了最明显的弱点。嵌入分析表明幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融显著减少了错误同时保持了OCR准确性。模型特别容易对标志性圆形徽标产生幻觉。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型往往依赖符号先验而非真实的字形感知，投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用。研究贡献了新的诊断视角和可行的缓解见解，强调投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Conclusion: 混合方法结合3D重建和生成增强在街景新视角合成任务中表现优异，为自动驾驶模拟提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place
overall.

<details>

Motivation: 现有SSC方法依赖时序堆叠或深度投影，缺乏显式运动推理，难以处理遮挡和噪声深度监督问题。

Method: 采用多级融合策略对齐跨帧分割、视觉和深度特征，使用预训练光流；通过课程学习机制从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度；利用SAM提供类别无关语义先验。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9的平均IoU，实现最先进性能。

Conclusion: CurriFlow的运动引导和课程感知设计有效提升了基于相机的3D语义场景补全性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可学习的自适应子采样框架，通过注意力引导的采样模块动态调整采样策略，减少神经网络的计算复杂度同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度增加，而在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法缺乏输入自适应性，采样机制固定不变。

Method: 设计注意力引导的采样模块，克服子采样操作不可微的挑战，实现输入自适应采样，可在推理阶段动态调整采样策略。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集上验证了方法的有效性，其中一个是在真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集。

Conclusion: 该方法能够动态适应不同输入，在减少深度神经网络模型复杂度的同时获得性能提升，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单帧图像中的装配物体状态检测，忽略时间特征，在物体部分遮挡时鲁棒性和准确性受限

Method: 双流框架：装配状态检测流处理无遮挡视图，时空流结合空间编码器（弱监督预训练）和基于Transformer的时间编码器，捕捉时空特征

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，相比现有方法分别减少步骤完成预测延迟11.2%和26.1%

Conclusion: 时空流不依赖物体无遮挡视图即可推断步骤完成，有效提升了过程步骤识别的性能

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归模型在训练图像缺乏足够多视角约束时会退化，需要引入先验知识来提升模型性能。

Method: 将SCR模型训练重新解释为概率问题，融入多种先验：从简单的重建深度分布先验到基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型先验。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，该方法学习到更好的场景表示，产生更一致的点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 概率化重解释和先验融合能有效提升SCR模型在约束不足场景下的性能，改善几何一致性和下游任务表现。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

Motivation: 低场MRI虽然经济便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要在不增加昂贵基础设施的情况下提升图像质量

Method: 使用条件流匹配框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布和目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标

Result: CFM不仅达到最先进性能，还能稳健泛化到分布内和分布外数据，同时比竞争深度学习方法使用更少的参数

Conclusion: CFM是MRI重建的强大可扩展工具，特别适合资源有限的临床环境

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的长视频理解框架，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法在时序上下文理解和关键信息保留方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中存在两个主要问题：1) 在单帧上进行建模和推理，难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文；2) 为降低密集帧标注成本而采用稀疏帧采样，可能丢失关键信息。

Method: VideoLucy采用受人类回忆过程启发的分层记忆结构，具有渐进粒度。通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制，系统性地挖掘视频范围内与问题相关的深度记忆，直到收集足够信息提供自信答案。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中，基于开源模型的VideoLucy显著优于最先进方法，性能甚至超过GPT-4o等最新专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯框架有效解决了长视频理解中的时序上下文理解和关键信息保留问题，在EgoMem新基准上展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Conclusion: 识别了当前研究的五大主要局限性，并概述了未来发展的有前景方向，为推进这一新兴领域奠定基础。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Result: 在未知检测器上相比最先进攻击方法达到27%更高的误分类率，显著提升了对抗样本的可转移性和视觉质量。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过两阶段框架有效平衡了对抗样本的可转移性和不可感知性，在黑盒深度伪造检测攻击中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Method: 使用Voronoi辅助扩散方法：1) 基于两个Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量；2) 通过能量函数优化法向量对齐；3) 扩散对齐的法向量形成近似UDF梯度场；4) 积分得到最终UDF。

Result: VAD方法能够稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何形状，同时保持计算效率和稳定性。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效、数值稳定的UDF计算方法，能够处理各种复杂几何拓扑，优于现有的神经方法。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Motivation: 现有的人体运动生成方法依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失，但这些策略对扩散模型来说并非必需。本文旨在证明通过理论驱动的简化方法也能达到同等效果。

Method: 使用基于分数的扩散模型，仅采用特征空间归一化和分析推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务中达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，同时避免了缓慢的后处理形状恢复过程。

Conclusion: 精心设计的特征归一化和分析推导的损失权重足以让扩散模型匹配人体运动分布，无需复杂的辅助策略。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习泛化能力差，强化学习样本效率低且收敛不稳定，需要结合两者优势

Method: 采用竞争性双策略框架，让IL和RL智能体在训练中互动，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上碰撞率降低18%，在长尾场景和泛化能力方面表现更好

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合了IL和RL的优势，显著提升了自动驾驶模型的性能

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

TL;DR: 提出了首个无人机多光谱多目标跟踪基准MMOT，包含125个视频序列和48.8万标注，并开发了光谱特征提取和方向感知的跟踪方案，显著提升了小目标和密集场景的跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机视角下由于目标小、遮挡严重和背景复杂导致的跟踪困难问题，利用多光谱图像的光谱反射特性来增强目标区分能力，弥补RGB图像在空间外观线索不足的缺陷。

Method: 开发了轻量级光谱3D-Stem模块集成光谱特征，保持与RGB预训练兼容；使用方向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计；构建端到端方向自适应transformer架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是在小目标和密集物体场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的多光谱跟踪方案将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖交叉注意力机制融合条件与运动，但这种方法主要捕获全局交互，难以保持逐步时间对齐。

Method: 引入基于Mamba的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型，将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的广泛实验表明，该模型在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的Temporally Conditional Mamba模型有效解决了基于时间条件的人类运动生成中的时间对齐问题，取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Result: 在四个公开数据集上评估，Plantnet微调的DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在Jaccard Index (IoU)上获得一致性能提升。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型和专用植物中心模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割。

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与学习到的表示相关，外部指导可以加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，利用模型自身不同层表示质量的差异，让语义丰富的表示指导较弱的表示。

Method: LayerSync是一种即插即用的正则化方法，通过同步扩散模型不同层的中间表示，让语义丰富的层指导较弱的层，无需外部监督或额外数据。

Result: 在图像生成任务上显著提升训练效率和生成质量，例如在ImageNet数据集上加速基于流的transformer训练8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。方法还适用于音频、视频和运动生成等其他领域。

Conclusion: LayerSync提供了一种自给自足的正则化方法，能够有效提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，且具有领域通用性。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Motivation: 像素空间生成模型通常比潜在空间模型更难训练且性能较差，存在持续的性能和效率差距。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器捕捉干净图像的语义，并将其与确定性采样轨迹上的点对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器集成，端到端微调完整模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型FID达到2.04，ImageNet-512上达到2.35（75 NFE）；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样FID达到8.82，显著超越潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该框架首次成功在不依赖预训练VAE或扩散模型的情况下，直接在像素空间训练高分辨率一致性模型，性能与领先VAE基模型相当。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法在减少标注需求的同时，显著提升了多模态推理的性能和效率

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出H-EGL框架，结合自监督和人工引导约束来增强注意力对齐，提高医学影像分类的泛化能力，在胸片分类任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中性能优异但容易学习虚假相关性，导致偏差和泛化能力受限。人工-AI注意力对齐可缓解此问题，但依赖昂贵的监督。

Method: 提出混合解释引导学习(H-EGL)框架，结合自监督和人工引导约束。自监督组件利用类别区分性注意力，不依赖限制性先验，提升鲁棒性和灵活性。

Result: 在胸片分类任务中使用Vision Transformer验证，H-EGL优于两种最先进的解释引导学习方法，表现出更好的分类准确率和泛化能力，产生的注意力图与人类专家知识更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架通过结合自监督和人工引导约束，有效提升了注意力对齐和模型泛化能力，在医学影像分类中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是一个评估多模态大语言模型在"与图像思考"范式下能力的基准，包含1204个跨5个领域的视觉任务，显示当前模型在视觉与工具整合方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要遵循"关于图像思考"的范式，将图像视为静态输入，而现实场景中用户提供的图像往往不完美，需要主动操作来发现关键视觉线索。

Method: 构建IRIS基准，包含1204个具有挑战性的开放视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，并配备详细评分标准。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的复杂任务上表现不佳，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率，不同模型展现出不同的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: IRIS作为首个专注于"与图像思考"的基准，为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解，揭示了当前模型在动态视觉推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在医疗领域应用时面临数据共享限制和隐私保护问题，联邦学习虽然能解决数据聚合问题，但需要更有效的个性化微调方法来充分利用各客户端数据。

Method: 使用正交LoRA适配器来解耦通用知识和客户端特定知识，在联邦学习框架下进行个性化微调。

Result: 在真实世界联邦医学影像任务上的初步结果显示，该方法与当前联邦微调方法相比具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗领域基础模型的联邦微调提供了一种有效的个性化解决方案，能够平衡通用知识和客户端特定知识的学习。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: SRUM是一个自奖励后训练框架，通过让统一多模态模型的理解模块作为内部评估器来改进生成模块，无需额外人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型在视觉理解和视觉生成之间存在显著差距，理解能力强的模型无法将其转化为生成能力。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局的正确性，局部奖励细化细粒度对象级保真度。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型能够通过自奖励机制让理解模块引导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

TL;DR: FlashVSR是首个基于扩散模型的实时视频超分辨率框架，通过三阶段蒸馏、稀疏注意力和小型解码器实现17 FPS的高效性能，在A100 GPU上处理768x1408视频。


<details>

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在视频超分辨率应用中面临高延迟、计算量大和超高分辨率泛化能力差的问题，需要实现高效、可扩展且实时的解决方案。

Method: 提出三阶段蒸馏管道实现流式超分辨率，使用局部约束稀疏注意力减少冗余计算，采用小型条件解码器加速重建，并构建了包含12万视频和18万图像的大规模数据集VSR-120K。

Result: FlashVSR在超高分辨率下可靠扩展，达到最先进性能，相比之前的一步扩散VSR模型速度提升高达12倍。

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，实现了效率、可扩展性和实时性能，将发布代码、预训练模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景感知解决方案存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的场景理解框架。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，将VPS、VO和SR任务紧密结合：VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；VO结合全景分割和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；SR利用VO结果将稀疏点云转换为神经场进行渲染。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，基于注意力的特征融合在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于大多数现有先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过任务间的紧密集成，有效解决了场景感知中的关键挑战，在多个下游任务上实现了性能提升。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准在评估深度语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题局限于简单句法结构和表面属性，导致模型利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 使用新颖的多智能体管道，让专门化智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的细致问题，构建沿相关视觉理解维度结构化的基准。

Result: 对14个最先进MLLM的评估显示当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型与开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在深度视觉语义理解方面的不足，特别是在复杂视觉关系、符号意义和叙事理解等维度上表现不佳。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出E-MoFlow框架，通过隐式时空和几何正则化联合优化自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中这两个问题独立求解的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将光流和6-DoF自运动估计分开处理，但在事件相机中由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联，这种独立求解方式成为不适定问题。现有方法要么引入变分正则化导致偏差和计算开销，要么使用参数化方法容易陷入局部最优。

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；引入微分几何约束整合结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计但保持几何一致性。

Result: 实验表明该方法适用于一般6-DoF运动场景，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow框架通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中的联合估计挑战。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，通过交叉注意力机制从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需外部硬件跟踪设备，在多种PET扫描仪和放射性示踪剂上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动是脑PET成像的主要挑战，会导致图像伪影和示踪剂定量不准确。硬件运动跟踪在临床实践中应用有限，需要开发数据驱动的运动校正方法。

Method: 使用深度学习结合交叉注意力机制，从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动。通过现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件跟踪的金标准运动测量进行监督训练。

Result: 在两个PET扫描仪和四种放射性示踪剂上验证，DL-HMC++优于现有数据驱动方法，生成无运动伪影的图像，与金标准硬件跟踪结果差异很小（HRRT: 1.2±0.5%，mCT: 0.5±0.2%）。

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除硬件跟踪负担，使运动校正技术更易在临床环境中推广应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Method: 提出了一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需编码器特定训练，可应用于各种视觉特征。

Result: AnyUp在特征上采样方面达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同的特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法在泛化性和应用范围上的限制。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient

efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual

replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

Abstract: This paper reviews the AIM 2025 Efficient Real-World Deblurring using Single

challenge is based on a new test set based on the well known RSBlur dataset.
Pairs of blur and degraded images in this dataset are captured using a

### [83] [UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789)
*Kevin Li,Manuel Brack,Sudeep Katakol,Hareesh Ravi,Ajinkya Kale*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一多模态编码器，通过Layerwise Attention Pooling机制提取多层级特征，并提出了VERIFI方法增强推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构通常使用分离的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。之前的方法要么使用VLM的最后一层信息，要么需要训练大型统一模型，计算成本高且可访问性有限。

Method: 提出UniFusion模型，核心是Layerwise Attention Pooling机制，从冻结VLM的文本和视觉token中提取高层语义和低层细节。还提出VERIFI方法，在推理时仅使用VLM生成的文本token来条件化扩散变换器。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构，能够忠实传递视觉信息。模型在单图像编辑任务上微调后，不仅提升了生成质量，还展现出零样本泛化到多图像参考的能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了跨模态知识迁移的有效性，在保持计算效率的同时增强了生成和编辑能力，展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

*Long Cui,Weiyun Wang,Jie Shao,Zichen Wen,Gen Luo,Linfeng Zhang,Yanting Zhang,Yu Qiao,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ViCO方法，通过视觉一致性学习让MLLM根据图像语义复杂度自适应调整视觉token数量，减少推理成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM由于图像输入引入额外视觉token导致推理成本增加，需要更高效的视觉表示方法

Method: 使用多个不同压缩率的MLP连接器对视觉token进行下采样，训练时最小化不同连接器间响应的KL散度，推理时通过ViR路由器自动选择合适压缩率

Result: 实验表明该方法能减少最多50%的视觉token，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力

Conclusion: ViCO方法为开发更高效的MLLM提供了新思路，代码和模型将开源以促进未来研究

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

*Caner Korkmaz,Brighton Nuwagira,Barış Coşkunuzer,Tolga Birdal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一个可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持续性(CMP)集成到深度学习管道中，通过分解CMP为可学习的单参数持续性，在医学影像和计算机视觉任务中提升分类和分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP虽然为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多滤过结构的复杂性和向量化困难，其应用受到限制。需要一种方法将CMP整合到深度学习框架中。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的多参数同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持续性组合，双滤过函数联合学习，确保可微分性。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上，CuMPerLay提升了分类和分割性能，特别是在数据有限的情况下表现更佳。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息整合到深度网络中提供了有前景的方向，适用于结构化图像分析。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

TL;DR: DriveVLA-W0通过世界建模预测未来图像，为视觉-语言-动作模型提供密集的自监督信号，解决监督不足问题，显著提升驾驶性能并增强数据缩放效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型存在监督不足问题：模型容量巨大但仅由稀疏的低维动作监督，导致表示能力未充分利用。

Method: 提出DriveVLA-W0训练范式，使用世界建模预测未来图像，为两种主流VLA架构（离散视觉标记的自回归世界模型和连续视觉特征的扩散世界模型）提供密集自监督信号，并引入轻量级动作专家解决实时推理延迟。

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2基准测试和680倍更大的内部数据集上，DriveVLA-W0显著优于BEV和VLA基线，并增强了数据缩放规律，显示随着训练数据量增加性能提升加速。

Conclusion: 世界建模为VLA模型提供了有效的密集监督信号，能够充分利用模型表示能力，显著提升驾驶智能性能并改善数据缩放效应。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Rex-Omni是一个3B规模的多模态大语言模型，在零样本设置下实现了与回归模型相当或更优的目标检测性能，通过特殊token表示量化坐标、多数据引擎和两阶段训练流程解决了MLLM在目标检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统坐标回归模型主导目标检测领域，而现有MLLM方法面临召回率低、重复预测、坐标不对齐等问题，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 1) 使用特殊token表示0-999的量化坐标；2) 构建多个数据引擎生成高质量标注数据；3) 采用两阶段训练流程：2200万数据的监督微调+基于GRPO的强化学习后训练。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS基准测试中，Rex-Omni在零样本设置下达到或超过回归模型（如DINO、Grounding DINO）的性能，并具备物体指代、指向、视觉提示、GUI定位等多种能力。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统铺平了道路，展示了MLLM在目标检测任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够进行按需多轮网络搜索的多模态大语言模型，能够动态构建图像和文本搜索查询，通过两阶段训练提升搜索效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多、搜索查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。需要开发能够动态适应真实世界变化信息的多模态搜索系统。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。构建DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，教导模型何时搜索、搜索什么、使用哪种搜索工具以及如何对检索信息进行推理。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 该方法为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，能够有效解决信息搜索和知识密集型用户查询的需求。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

TL;DR: LLMs在解决逻辑谜题时经常依赖记忆而非推理，当谜题被轻微修改时性能显著下降，这种现象被称为'幻影回忆'


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板，以及如何系统性地评估和改进这种能力

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本，评估11个领先LLM，并提供自动化逻辑等价判断、错误分类和提示缓解框架

Result: LLMs在原始谜题上表现接近完美，但在扰动版本上显著低于人类水平，表现出幻影回忆和过度阐述等错误模式

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文线索变化时往往无法重新推理，揭示了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否适合作为世界模型，解决其幻觉问题和静态知识依赖导致的长期模拟错误累积问题。

Method: 通过三个任务评估LLMs的世界建模能力：下一状态识别、完整流程规划对齐和里程碑转换识别。提出R-WoM方法，通过检索外部教程知识来增强LLM模拟。

Result: LLMs能有效捕捉即时下一状态和有意义的转换，但在完整流程规划中性能迅速下降。R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上分别提升25.3%和18.1%。

Conclusion: LLMs在长期环境动态建模方面存在局限性，R-WoM通过知识检索显著改善了长期模拟性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM内部知识表示对输入变化很脆弱，语义保持的微小扰动（如拼写错误、改写）就会导致真假陈述的可分离性显著下降，表明LLM学习的是浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM性能脆弱性是否源于内部知识表示的不稳定性，研究当输入分布发生变化时，LLM区分真假陈述的能力如何退化。

Method: 对四个LLM家族、五个评估数据集和三种知识探测方法，应用语义保持的扰动使样本分布外，评估表示可分离性的退化情况。

Result: 随着样本与预训练数据的相似度降低，真假陈述的内部表示可分离性崩溃，LLM区分真假的能力高度依赖陈述的具体表面形式。

Conclusion: LLM学习的知识表示浅层且非鲁棒，这解释了基准测试的脆弱性，对真实性探测的实用性提出挑战，呼吁改进知识表示鲁棒性的研究。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间标记的潜在益处，特别是在不同资源水平和设置下的多语言对翻译中。

Method: 使用蒸馏链式思维方法微调模型，生成逐步翻译的合成解释，并构建包含模块化翻译特定提示策略的中间标记。

Result: 思考标记不能帮助大型推理模型更好地执行机器翻译任务，标准输入输出微调表现更优。但通过组合模块化翻译提示策略构建中间标记可获得改进。

Conclusion: 中间标记在微调中的贡献高度依赖于其中是否包含翻译尝试，使用教师模型精炼目标翻译或扩展平行语料库比蒸馏其链式思维解释更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

TL;DR: TopoAlign框架利用代码仓库作为数学大语言模型的训练资源，通过将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，并重组为结构上类似形式数学语句的代码数据，从而提升模型在数学形式化任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化任务上表现不佳，主要受限于大规模语料库的稀缺性，特别是包含非正式和形式化数学语句对的数据集。虽然现有模型能够从自然语言指令生成代码，但代码与形式数学之间的结构和语法差异限制了有效的迁移学习。

Method: 提出TopoAlign框架，将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后重新组装这些组件，使其在结构上镜像形式数学语句，从而产生结构对齐的代码数据用于训练数学大语言模型，无需额外的人工标注。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math和Herald两个先进模型上评估，TopoAlign显著提升了DeepSeek-Math的性能，在BEq@10上提高17.77%，在typecheck@10上提高68.82%。对于Herald模型，尽管没有引入新的数学知识，在BEq@10和typecheck@10上分别获得了0.12%和1.09%的提升。

Conclusion: TopoAlign框架证明，即使对于专门化模型，在结构对齐的代码数据上进行训练也是有益的，能够有效利用广泛可用的代码仓库作为数学大语言模型的训练资源，提升自动形式化任务的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

Method: 整合人口统计、文化和心理学框架（Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查、大五人格特质），生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的书籍描述生成任务中，相比提示条件、标准微调和朴素合成对生成，GRAVITY实现了超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究显示86%的情况下更偏好GRAVITY输出

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能够捕捉更丰富的用户差异，减少对昂贵标注的依赖，生成更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了可扩展路径

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs管道，用于自动生成不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询的RAG基准测试，显著提高了基准测试的难度和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG基准测试很少反映真实任务复杂性，多跳或超出范围的问题往往可以通过断开推理作弊解决，或仅需要简单事实回忆，限制了发现现有RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了第一个自动、难度可控的管道，用于创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询(CRUMQs)，可适应任何语料库和领域。

Result: 在两个流行的RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验结果显示相比先前RAG基准测试，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低了81.0%。

Conclusion: CRUMQs管道提供了一种简单方法来增强基准测试难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DMTD的直接多令牌解码方法，通过利用预训练LLM中不同层级的特定功能，仅使用后层生成多个令牌，无需重复遍历早期和中间层，从而实现推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中不同层级具有特定功能的观察：早期层处理输入理解，中间层处理任务特定处理，后层将抽象表示转换为输出令牌。假设经过早期和中间层处理后，隐藏状态已包含足够信息来支持仅使用后层生成多个令牌。

Method: DMTD方法：利用预训练LLM的层级分工特性，在推理时仅使用后层直接生成多个令牌，无需重复计算早期和中间层。该方法不引入额外参数、辅助例程或后生成验证。

Result: 在有限数据集上微调的DMTD Qwen3-4B模型已显示出有希望的结果，实现了高达2倍的加速，仅有轻微性能损失。扩展分析表明，随着训练数据集的增大，性能有望进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMTD提供了一种有效的推理加速方法，利用LLM层级分工特性实现多令牌生成，无需额外开销，具有良好的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架让LLM智能体能够主动管理工作上下文，通过程序化分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，从而在长视野任务中显著减少上下文使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长视野任务中受到上下文长度的根本限制，需要更有效的上下文管理方法。

Method: 开发了端到端强化学习框架FoldGRPO，通过特定过程奖励鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理，使智能体能够程序化分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤。

Result: 在复杂长视野任务（深度研究和软件工程）上，折叠智能体匹配或优于ReAct基线，同时使用10倍更小的活动上下文，并显著优于依赖基于摘要的上下文管理模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架有效解决了LLM智能体在长视野任务中的上下文限制问题，通过主动的上下文管理实现了更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架，专门衡量LLMs在数学猜想生成和形式化方面的能力，并设计了Lean-FIRe方法来改进这一过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动形式化研究忽视了猜想生成这一关键前置步骤，导致LLMs的形式化能力被高估，需要专门评估和改进其猜想能力。

Method: 扩充现有数据集创建ConjectureBench，重新设计评估框架和指标，并提出了推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进猜想生成和自动形式化。

Result: 当考虑猜想步骤时，GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1的自动形式化性能被显著高估，但使用Lean-FIRe方法后，GPT-4.1成功端到端形式化了13个PutnamBench问题，DeepSeek-V3.1形式化了7个。

Conclusion: LLMs具备生成准确猜想所需的知识，但需要将猜想作为独立任务处理，并研究如何正确整合到自动形式化流程中。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了SAGE框架，这是一个用于多轮交互式代理评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务上下文知识来生成更真实和多样化的交互，能够发现更多代理错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮交互代理评估方法通常使用通用用户模型，忽视了领域特定原则，无法捕捉真实用户行为。需要一种能够结合业务知识的模拟框架来提高评估的准确性。

Method: SAGE框架整合了自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务代理基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），基于真实的客户角色来模拟用户行为。

Result: 该方法生成的交互更加真实和多样化，能够识别出多达33%的代理错误，显示出其作为评估工具在支持错误发现和迭代代理改进方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SAGE框架通过整合业务上下文知识，显著提高了多轮交互代理评估的准确性和实用性，能够更好地支持代理的改进和优化。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动问题生成方法，用于离散数学中的逻辑等价问题，通过定义形式语言和生成规则，开发线性时间算法，生成质量与教科书相当的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学时代抄袭现象日益严重，需要为每个学生生成独特问题以防止作弊，同时提供大量练习题目。现有方法效率低且问题难度不一致。

Method: 使用形式语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两组生成规则，开发线性时间算法进行问题生成。

Result: 学生测试显示生成问题的准确性与教科书问题相当；问题解决步骤分析表明难度与教科书问题相似。

Conclusion: 提出的AQG方法能有效生成高质量的逻辑等价问题，质量与教科书问题相当，可用于防作弊和练习目的。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取趋势过度依赖大语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累，需要系统比较不同方法的实际表现。

Method: 在农业领域的猪肉、乳制品和作物三个子领域中，对9个访谈进行对比评估，比较神经符号系统和LLM系统的性能。

Result: LLM系统总体表现更好（F1总分69.4 vs 52.7，核心分数63.0 vs 47.2），但神经符号系统运行更快、控制性更强，在无上下文任务中精度更高。

Conclusion: 部署NLP系统存在"隐藏成本"，需要在性能、效率和可控性之间取得平衡，两种方法各有适用场景。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CPR框架，通过清理不良提示和生成额外任务描述来减少LLM的幻觉问题，显著提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM有时会生成看似合理但错误的'幻觉'事实，这通常源于用户使用结构不良或模糊的提示，导致模型基于假设而非实际意图生成回答。

Method: 引入CPR（治愈性提示优化）框架，使用微调的小型语言模型来清理不良提示并生成额外的信息性任务描述，以对齐用户意图和提示。

Result: 应用CPR后，语言模型的生成质量显著提高，同时减少了幻觉。实证研究显示，使用CPR的提示在90%以上的情况下优于原始提示，且无需外部知识。

Conclusion: CPR框架能有效缓解由不良提示引起的LLM幻觉问题，提升模型生成质量，是一种即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在幻觉问题上仍面临挑战，特别是格式错误的提示（包含歧义、语法错误或不完整信息）对幻觉的影响研究不足。

Method: MPR框架通过多个阶段系统改进提示，每个阶段针对特定错误（如标点、拼写错误、关键词误用），使用微调的小语言模型，并通过自反机制和排序优先处理最相关输入。

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式胜率超过85%，能有效减少幻觉并提高输出准确性。

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级且适应性强的解决方案，可与现有后处理幻觉缓解框架结合，提升大语言模型在各领域的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在可靠性问题，容易产生看似合理但事实错误的幻觉输出，需要不确定性量化方法来评估模型生成的可信度。

Method: 从不确定性量化的基础定义出发，区分认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，将这些概念适配到LLM语境，系统分类现有方法并展示代表性方法的实证结果。

Result: 不确定性量化为识别不可靠生成提供了机制，能够有效检测幻觉并提高模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化是解决LLM幻觉问题的核心研究方向，当前方法已取得进展但仍存在局限，需要进一步研究来完善LLM的可信度评估体系。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在处理简单或描述不充分的提示时，往往产生图像与文本对齐度差、美学质量低的问题。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为提示词重写器，设计奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，无需监督微调数据即可优化提示词。

Result: 在多个T2I模型和基准测试中，该方法能持续改善图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，且具有良好的跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且实用的模型无关策略，能够显著提升文本到图像生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出分层对齐方法，针对Transformer模型的不同功能层（局部、中间、全局）分别进行DPO优化，避免传统统一对齐导致的"对齐税"问题，在保持语法流畅性的同时显著提升事实一致性和逻辑连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术（如DPO）将模型视为单一实体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层次的功能专门化（从语法处理到抽象推理），导致优化效果不理想。

Method: 引入分层对齐方法，使用LoRA对模型的不同功能块进行针对性DPO优化：局部层（语法）、中间层（逻辑）、全局层（事实性），通过LLM-as-Judge进行评估。

Result: 局部层对齐提升语法流畅性，全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还是提升逻辑连贯性的最有效策略，所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中的"对齐税"问题。

Conclusion: 分层对齐为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控和可解释的路径，从整体优化转向结构感知的精细调优，有望构建更先进可靠的LLM。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Result: 在仅使用50%-70%输入序列的情况下，APCE在摘要任务上表现优于或与完整密集基线相当，同时显著提升了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种上下文感知的效率解决方案，有望激发更多针对其他长上下文任务的相关研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

TL;DR: Verily行为健康安全过滤器(VBHSF)在精神健康危机检测中表现优异，相比NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest具有更高的敏感性和平衡性能，能有效减少漏检危机的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不恰当建议，需要开发专门的安全过滤器来防止破坏性行为。

Method: 在两个数据集上评估VBHSF：Verily精神健康危机数据集(1800条模拟消息)和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集(794条精神健康相关消息)，并与NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest进行比较分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上表现出高敏感性(0.990)和特异性(0.992)，F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上敏感性0.982，准确性0.921。相比其他两种方法，VBHSF在所有情况下都具有显著更高的敏感性(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF展示了稳健、可推广的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最小化漏检危机，这对医疗应用至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs创造力评估中的数据污染和人工评估成本高的问题，借鉴人类创造力评估方法。

Method: 提出PACE方法，让LLMs生成平行关联链来评估其创造力，并与Chatbot Arena创意写作排名进行相关性验证。

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena排名强相关（Spearman's ρ=0.739），高性能LLMs接近普通人创造力水平，但专业人士仍优于LLMs；人类和LLMs都显示关联具体性下降趋势，但人类关联模式更多样。

Conclusion: PACE是评估LLMs创造力的有效方法，LLMs在创造力方面已接近普通人水平，但与专业人士仍有差距，人类在关联多样性方面表现更优。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言领域适应中知识获取机制不明确，导致在低资源环境下性能不佳，需要深入理解LLMs如何学习领域知识并在语言间转移。

Method: 提出AdaXEval自适应评估方法，从训练用的双语领域语料构建选择题数据集，通过持续训练跟踪LLMs获取领域事实的过程。

Result: 实验发现，即使使用高质量双语语料，跨语言知识转移仍然困难，揭示了从训练数据到知识转化的具体机制。

Conclusion: 跨语言知识转移在多语言领域适应中仍面临挑战，需要更有效的方法来促进语言间的知识共享。

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Result: 研究发现语音和文本表示在深层网络中方向相似度增加但欧氏距离扩大，表示相似度与模态差距强相关，提出的干预策略显示出改善语音输入正确性的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统分析了LSLMs中的模态差距和对齐机制，为未来优化提供了理论和方法的指导，揭示了通过改善表示对齐来提升语音输入性能的可能性。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型的广泛应用，安全问题日益突出。多轮对话比单轮提示风险更大，但现有基准测试未能充分考虑这种情况。

Method: 构建包含10,000个样本的SafeMT基准测试，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法，并提出安全指数(SI)评估模型安全性。同时开发了对话安全调节器来检测对话中的恶意意图。

Result: 评估了17个模型，发现随着有害对话轮数增加，成功攻击的风险显著上升，表明模型的安全机制不足以识别对话交互中的危险。实验显示提出的调节器比现有防护模型更有效降低多轮攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全防护存在不足，需要专门的对话安全机制来应对隐蔽的恶意意图攻击。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Credal Transformer通过引入基于证据理论的Credal注意力机制，用概率分布集合替代单一注意力向量，直接量化模型不确定性，有效减少LLM的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的Softmax函数产生"人工确定性"，将模糊的注意力分数压缩为单一概率分布，丢弃了每层的不确定性信息，导致LLM产生事实错误但自信的断言。

Method: 用Credal注意力机制(CAM)替代标准注意力，将注意力分数重新概念化为狄利克雷分布的证据质量，产生"credal set"（概率分布集合），集合大小直接衡量模型不确定性。

Result: Credal Transformer能够识别分布外输入、量化模糊性，并在无法回答的问题上通过弃权显著减少自信错误。

Conclusion: 提出了缓解幻觉的新架构和将不确定性量化直接集成到模型中的设计范式，为更可靠的AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hallucinate, generating factually incorrect yet
confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

Motivation: 探索在连续空间推理中应用离散空间中已证明有效的推理技术（多样本生成和奖励模型重排序）的可行性，以提升连续推理语言模型的性能。

Method: 使用COCONUT连续空间推理LM作为骨干，通过dropout-based采样生成多样化推理路径，分析Pass@N性能，并探究几何特性和轨迹动态等维度来识别连续空间中推理的挑战。

Result: 研究表明在连续空间中生成多样化推理路径是可行的，但离散空间中的数据生成和奖励模型训练方法在连续空间中只能带来边际改进，因为连续思维表示缺乏必要的归纳偏置来有效区分正确和错误推理。

Conclusion: 连续推理语言模型的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还应明确纳入可在推理时用于区分正确和错误思维的归纳偏置，以克服当前连续空间推理的局限性。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分研究，特别是模型预测时间戳时存在的系统性偏差问题。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，量化分析时间偏差现象，提出时间偏差指数来测量预测事件时间的系统性偏差，并开发可视化框架。

Result: 研究发现时间偏差在数据集和模型中普遍存在，随音频长度增加而累积（可达数十秒），且在不同事件类型和位置间存在差异。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型存在基本的时间定位限制，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构来解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但受限于监督学习目标，缺乏对人类偏好的对齐，这在实际实时翻译中很重要

Method: 使用基于大语言模型的分割框架，采用直接偏好优化进行训练，预测更符合实时翻译需求的分割点

Result: 在ACL 60/60语料库上评估，在三个语言对上，DPO调优的LLM比SHAS获得更高的分割准确率，并在BLEU、COMET和平均延迟指标上一致提升

Conclusion: 偏好调优的LLM有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推动自适应、人类对齐的同步翻译发展

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估缺乏真实场景基础，未考虑不同领域危害严重性的差异。

Method: 使用五阶段流水线将九个应用领域分为三个层级（严重、中等、轻度），评估八个LLM。

Result: LLM在不同领域的公平性不一致；模型大小或性能不保证公平性；推理模型在医疗决策支持中表现更好但在教育中更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与部署准备度之间的明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

Motivation: 探究大语言模型在微调过程中如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德判断偏见，并理解其形成机制。

Method: 在3个开源权重的大语言模型上进行层修补分析，通过将预训练模型的激活修补到微调模型的关键层来研究偏见定位。

Conclusion: 大语言模型中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位和缓解，通过针对性干预无需重新训练模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted

*Jiakai Li,Rongzheng Wang,Yizhuo Ma,Shuang Liang,Guangchun Luo,Ke Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSAS方法解决LLM在多文档问答中的长距离依赖建模和"中间丢失"问题，通过上下文门控加权和互斥注意力抑制模块，无需修改架构或额外训练参数即可提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难，难以关注长文本中的关键信息；"中间丢失"问题，难以处理长输入中间位置的信息。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调，缺乏通用简单的解决方案。

Method: 提出双阶段自适应锐化(DSAS)方法，包含两个模块：(1)上下文门控加权(CGW)模块，通过逐层注意力跟踪和位置感知加权评估段落相关性，缓解"中间丢失"问题；(2)互斥注意力抑制(RAS)模块，通过抑制关键文本与无关文本之间的信息交换，增强对关键段落的关注，改善长距离依赖建模。DSAS是即插即用解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLM（Llama、Qwen、Mistral和Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上的多文档问答任务中平均F1分数提升4.2%。消融研究确认了CGW和RAS模块的重要贡献。

Conclusion: DSAS提供了一种有效解决LLM在多文档问答中长距离依赖和"中间丢失"问题的通用方法，具有即插即用、无需修改架构的优势，在各种主流模型上表现出稳定的性能提升。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: MedQA-Followup框架评估医疗问答中多轮对话的鲁棒性，发现LLMs在复杂医疗咨询中表现脆弱，间接干预比直接建议更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估框架主要关注单轮问答的理想条件，忽视了医疗咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂性，需要系统评估多轮对话的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在答案被挑战时保持准确性），同时引入间接-直接轴来区分上下文框架和明确建议。

Result: 评估五个最先进LLM发现，模型在浅层扰动下表现尚可，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，Claude Sonnet 4准确率从91.2%降至13.5%。间接干预通常比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLM安全可靠部署的关键但未充分探索的维度，需要更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

### [125] [Chinese ModernBERT with Whole-Word Masking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12285)
*Zeyu Zhao,Ningtao Wang,Xing Fu,Yu Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头开始训练的中文编码器，通过优化的词汇表、动态掩码训练、两阶段预训练和稳定学习率调度，在中文NLP任务上实现了竞争性性能，特别是在长序列处理和信息检索任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer改进主要针对英文，未能充分适应中文的独特分词和形态特征，需要专门为中文设计优化的预训练模型。

Method: 使用32k BPE词汇表优化中文词缀/复合词；采用动态掩码训练(30%→15%)；两阶段预训练扩展上下文长度；阻尼余弦学习率调度；在1.2T中文token上进行预训练。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强中文编码器竞争；在SimCLUE测试集上达到0.505(Pearson)/0.537(Spearman)；在开放数据设置下超越Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT为中文NLP提供了有效的预训练解决方案，展示了在信息检索任务上的扩展潜力，并将发布模型权重促进可复现研究。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用大型语言模型自动进行语法标注的无监督流程，在COHA语料库中实现了98%+的准确率，大幅提升了语料标注效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语料库快速扩张，手动标注成为语料语言学工作的主要瓶颈，需要开发可扩展的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用四阶段工作流程：提示工程、事前评估、自动批量处理和事后验证，使用GPT-5通过OpenAI API进行无监督标注。

Result: 在60小时内标注了COHA语料库中的143,933个句子，在两个复杂标注任务中达到98%以上的准确率。

Conclusion: LLM能够以最小人工干预大规模执行数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟了新可能，但需关注成本、许可和伦理问题。

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于知识检索增强生成（RAG）的反言论生成框架，通过整合联合国数字图书馆等权威知识库，为8个主要目标群体生成可信的反言论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，需要开发更可信和连贯的反言论生成方法。

Method: 构建包含32,792个文本的知识库，集成RAG管道，将反言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程。

Result: 在MultiTarget-CONAN数据集上的评估显示，该框架在标准指标和人工评估中均优于标准LLM基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究可信和合理的反言论生成开辟了新途径，适用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型与人类大脑活动之间的对齐可以揭示语言处理的底层计算原理，特别是解决关于大脑对齐与下一个词预测关系的争议性问题。

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词语，并分析BA和NWP所依赖的词语子集特征。

Result: 发现BA和NWP依赖于大部分不同的词语子集：NWP表现出近因和首因偏差，关注句法信息；而BA优先考虑语义和语篇层面信息，具有更针对性的近因效应。

Conclusion: 这项工作增进了我们对LLM与人类语言处理关系的理解，并突出了BA和NWP在特征依赖方面的差异。归因方法可广泛应用于探索模型预测在不同语言处理任务中的认知相关性。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制减少不重要token的专家数量来加速推理，同时保持重要token的完整专家以保证模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型卸载策略受限于CPU-GPU互连带宽，预取方法训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出混合大小专家机制，为不重要token使用一半专家加速，为重要token保留完整专家；设计专用的回退和预取机制在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上，MoBiLE在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现了1.60x到1.72x的加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: MoBiLE框架有效解决了MoE推理中的带宽瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升了推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作流程中的深度整合，其在研究和评审中的双重角色带来了新的风险，特别是对学术公平性的潜在影响需要深入探索。

Method: 通过模拟实验，设置研究代理（生成和修改论文）和评审代理（评估提交的论文），然后进行人工标注分析。

Result: LLM评审者系统性地给LLM撰写的论文打高分，同时持续低估包含批判性陈述的人类论文；发现LLM存在语言特征偏见和批判陈述厌恶两种主要偏见。

Conclusion: 如果不加谨慎地将LLM部署在同行评审中，会给人类作者和学术研究带来风险和公平性问题；但LLM指导的修改确实能提升论文质量，对早期研究者和低质量论文有益。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

Motivation: 标记化差异阻碍了语言多样化人口公平获取人工智能服务，需要系统量化大型语言模型中的计算不平等问题。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对200多种语言样本进行统一标记化处理，收集标记化统计数据，使用TPS和RTC等评估指标。

Result: 拉丁文字语言标记化效率高，非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言标记化成本显著增加3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用率降低。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，未来研究应优先开发语言感知的标记化策略和自适应词汇构建方法，确保更包容和计算公平的多语言AI系统。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的RAG方法存在静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对超图结构和语义的浅层使用等限制，影响了多跳问答的有效性。

Method: PRoH包含三个核心创新：上下文感知规划模块、结构化问题分解过程和实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索算法。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1分数比之前的SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG高出19.73%，生成评估分数高出8.41%，并在长距离多跳推理任务中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH通过动态规划和推理机制有效克服了现有方法的局限性，为知识超图上的检索增强生成提供了更强大的多跳问答能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，即模型响应与检索证据相矛盾。现有方法主要依赖外部干预，忽略了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数化记忆的关键问题，特别是在知识冲突情况下。

Method: 提出CLEAR框架：1）将上下文分解为细粒度的句子级知识；2）使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；3）引入冲突感知微调来指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实性，在各种冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: CLEAR通过分析LLM内部表示和冲突感知微调，有效解决了RAG系统中的不忠实问题，为LLM如何整合外部知识提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过多语言Wug测试考察LLMs在形态学泛化任务中的表现，发现模型能够以类似人类的准确率泛化到未见词汇，但准确率模式更受训练数据量而非语言结构复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的语言能力，特别是它们是否能像人类一样处理新词的形态学变化，以及模型表现是受语言结构复杂度还是训练数据量主导。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在四种语言（加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语、西班牙语）上测试六个模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 模型能够以人类水平的准确率泛化形态学过程，但准确率与语言社区规模和数据可用性更相关，西班牙语和英语表现优于资源较少的加泰罗尼亚语和希腊语。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂度的敏感性，其表现仅表面上类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

Conclusion: SMEC框架能有效解决高维嵌入的计算和存储问题，为LLM的实际部署提供可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型生成能力的提升，身份模仿风险增加，但现有研究缺乏对个性化机器生成文本检测的评估。

Method: 构建个性化文本检测基准，分析特征反转陷阱现象，并提出基于潜在方向识别的性能预测方法。

Result: 实验显示个性化设置下检测器性能存在显著差距，提出的预测方法与实际性能差距相关性达85%。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化文本检测研究提供了基准和方法，鼓励进一步研究个性化场景下的文本检测问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

TL;DR: 该论文将测试时缩放技术从数学和编程领域转移到LeWiDi-2025任务中，用于评估标注分歧。实验发现两种基准算法能持续提升LLM性能，但Best-of-N采样方法无效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放技术此前仅限于有可验证正确答案的领域（如数学和编程），本研究旨在将其扩展到评估标注分歧的LeWiDi任务中。

Method: 使用三种测试时缩放方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样，在LeWiDi-2025任务上进行实验。

Result: 两种基准算法（模型平均和多数投票）在LeWiDi任务上持续提升了LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法没有效果。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功转移到LeWiDi任务，论文分析了造成这种差距的潜在原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在处理非典型实例时如何权衡语用先验（输入相关）和语义先验（概念一般性）之间的冲突。

Method: 引入新的评估数据集VISaGE，包含典型和例外图像，通过精心平衡的实验分析VLMs的权衡行为。

Result: 当输入图像与文本不一致时，概念理解会下降，语用先验的影响比语义先验更强。

Conclusion: VLMs在处理个体实例时更依赖语用先验，当输入不一致时概念理解会受损。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

*Bryan Eikema,Evgenia Ilia,José G. C. de Souza,Chrysoula Zerva,Wilker Aziz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT)方法，通过微调让大语言模型能够忠实表达不确定性，而不改变其答案分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同的答案，但生成的响应通常没有修饰或修饰方式不能反映这种变异性，这造成了忠实性差距。

Method: 通过将模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'或'很可能'）对齐来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性相匹配，只需要模型和一组提示词而无需额外监督。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的开放域问答评估显示，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入了最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教会LLMs忠实传达不确定性，在各种解码策略、修饰语选择和其他不确定性表达形式下都表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在开放域写作中的广泛应用，检测机器生成文本对于确保内容真实性和可信度变得至关重要。现有方法在现实场景中泛化能力有限，易受改写攻击，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出StyleDecipher框架，联合建模离散风格指标和基于语义嵌入的连续风格表示，在统一表示空间中捕捉人类与LLM输出的风格差异，无需模型内部访问或标注片段。

Result: 在五个不同领域（新闻、代码、论文、评论、学术摘要）的实验中，StyleDecipher在域内检测准确率上达到最先进水平，跨域评估中比现有基线提升高达36.30%，且对对抗扰动和混合人机内容保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架在准确性和可解释性方面均表现出色，为机器生成文本检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

Method: 构建ACADATA数据集，包含ACAD-TRAIN训练集和ACAD-BENCH评估集，在ACAD-TRAIN上微调大语言模型，并与专业机器翻译系统、通用LLM和专有模型进行对比评估。

Result: 微调后的模型在学术翻译质量上平均提升6.1-12.4 d-BLEU点，长文本翻译能力提升24.9%，表现优于最佳专有和开源模型。

Conclusion: ACADATA数据集和微调模型为学术翻译和长文本翻译研究提供了有价值的资源，显著提升了翻译质量。

Abstract: We present ACADATA, a high-quality parallel dataset for academic translation,
that consists of two subsets: ACAD-TRAIN, which contains approximately 1.5
million author-generated paragraph pairs across 96 language directions and
ACAD-BENCH, a curated evaluation set of almost 6,000 translations covering 12
directions. To validate its utility, we fine-tune two Large Language Models
(LLMs) on ACAD-TRAIN and benchmark them on ACAD-BENCH against specialized
machine-translation systems, general-purpose, open-weight LLMs, and several
large-scale proprietary models. Experimental results demonstrate that
fine-tuning on ACAD-TRAIN leads to improvements in academic translation quality
by +6.1 and +12.4 d-BLEU points on average for 7B and 2B models respectively,
while also improving long-context translation in a general domain by up to
24.9% when translating out of English. The fine-tuned top-performing model
surpasses the best propietary and open-weight models on academic translation
domain. By releasing ACAD-TRAIN, ACAD-BENCH and the fine-tuned models, we
provide the community with a valuable resource to advance research in academic

Motivation: 大型语言模型对提示设计高度敏感，现有COSTAR框架在大型LLMs上表现良好，但在小型本地优化模型上性能不稳定，特别是在需要更多指导或约束输出的任务中。

Method: 通过一系列受控的提示-输出评估，使用小型（最多80亿参数）微调模型测试COSTAR-A框架的有效性。

Result: COSTAR-A能够增强本地化LLMs的输出结构和决策性，但效果因模型和用例而异。Llama 3.1-8B模型在使用COSTAR-A时表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式需要昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，本文旨在研究如何在不损害推理性能的前提下大幅降低标注成本。

Method: 提出PARO框架，通过识别模式化推理任务中的固定推理模式，让LLM基于这些模式自动生成对齐的推理轨迹，无需人工标注。

Result: 实验表明PARO生成的推理轨迹在SFT+RLVR中能达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的性能水平。

Conclusion: 对于模式化推理任务，大规模人工标注可以被仅需有限人工监督的LLM自动标注所替代，推理模式而非标注数量或质量是性能的关键决定因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在开放生成任务中存在校准问题：对于创意任务输出过于同质化，对于事实任务则产生多样化但不正确的幻觉响应。这两种失败模式都可以通过生成空间大小(GSS)概念来统一解释和解决。

Method: 提出GSSBench任务套件，包含具有真实GSS关系的提示对，评估不同指标并理解模型与期望行为的差异。使用模型内部状态进行幻觉检测，特别是EigenScore指标。

Result: 发现幻觉检测指标（特别是EigenScore）在仅使用模型内部信息的情况下，持续优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标，并能提供模型内部任务表示的可解释见解。

Conclusion: GSS概念具有三个重要应用：检测提示歧义并预测澄清问题、解释推理模型中的过度思考和思考不足、引导模型扩展生成空间以获得高质量和多样化的输出。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

Motivation: 当前全语言模型在处理音频和视频信号时，细节感知能力有限，且存在细节与幻觉共同增长的问题，需要系统研究全模态细粒度感知。

Method: 提出Omni-Detective代理数据生成管道，集成工具调用来自主生成高质量多模态数据；基于此数据训练Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner模型；设计Omni-Cloze评估基准。

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上超越所有开源模型，性能媲美Gemini 2.5 Pro；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到新SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现细节与幻觉的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量细节描述，Omni-Cloze能稳定可靠地评估细节描述，为全模态细粒度感知提供了系统解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Motivation: 扩展语言模型归纳偏好的研究，从两个角度改进：采用更接近自然语言的广义范畴语法，以及更关注模型对未见长句的泛化能力。

Method: 使用广义范畴语法构建人工语言，覆盖无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构，评估语言模型对未见长句的泛化表现。

Result: 类型学上合理的词序更易于语言模型进行生产性泛化，实验范式得出了更清晰的结论。

Conclusion: 语言模型确实具有偏好类型学频率语法属性的归纳偏差，合理的词序结构有助于模型更好地泛化。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然度具有挑战性，因为'自然度'概念多变且缺乏可扩展的定量指标。

Method: 引入DGRC方法：将对话分解为提示，用语言模型生成子部分续写，重新组合对话和续写，比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续at-issue内容，指令调优模型此效应更强；当存在相关线索时，它们会降低at-issue偏好。

Conclusion: DGRC方法能减轻语言模型分析中的偏见，系统测试话语敏感行为；指令调优虽未进一步放大调节模式，但反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

Motivation: 针对当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论对LLMs的语言学评论过于推测性和无建设性，作者认为需要转向更实用的经验主义视角来理解LLMs的语言建模能力。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的经验主义语言学框架，将语言定义为所有说写内容的总和，强调使用频率作为语言的主要支配原则，并基于此重新审视LLMs。

Result: 基于Mańczak框架挑战了先前对LLMs的批评，为语言模型的设计、评估和解释提供了建设性指导。

Conclusion: 经验主义语言学视角为理解和改进LLMs提供了更实用和建设性的框架，超越了传统结构主义语言观的局限性。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

*Ahmed Heakl,Martin Gubri,Salman Khan,Sangdoo Yun,Seong Joon Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个可改造的动态层路由框架，通过轻量级路由器决定跳过、执行或重复Transformer层，在保持准确性的同时提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有Transformer层处理，导致简单查询计算浪费，复杂查询推理深度不足。现有自适应深度方法存在推理时搜索成本高、架构改动大或准确率下降等问题。

Method: 在预训练模型上添加轻量级每层路由器，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)生成高质量层配置，采用窗口池化稳定路由、焦点损失与类别平衡、瓶颈MLP路由器等技术。

Result: 在ARC和DART任务上准确率提升达+3.4%，平均每样本节省5层计算。路由器能泛化到多个领域任务，仅损失0.85%准确率，比现有路由方法提升达+7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明显式监督的路由器可以在不改变基础权重的情况下，为冻结LLM提供预算感知、精度驱动的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究显示，为低资源语言（特别是低识字率的口头语言如班巴拉语）创建高质量语音数据集需要大量人工成本：实验室条件下平均30小时人工转录1小时语音，实地条件下需要36小时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解为低资源语言创建语音数据集的实际人工成本，特别是针对低识字率的口头语言，这对自然语言处理资源开发至关重要。

Method: 通过为期一个月的实地研究，让10名母语转录员对53小时班巴拉语语音数据的ASR生成转录进行校正分析。

Result: 实验室条件下平均需要30小时人工转录1小时语音，实地条件下需要36小时人工转录1小时语音。

Conclusion: 该研究为具有类似特征的语言创建NLP资源提供了基准和实用见解，揭示了低资源语言语音数据标注的高昂人工成本。

Abstract: Creating speech datasets for low-resource languages is a critical yet poorly
understood challenge, particularly regarding the actual cost in human labor.
This paper investigates the time and complexity required to produce
high-quality annotated speech data for a subset of low-resource languages, low
literacy Predominately Oral Languages, focusing on Bambara, a Manding language
of Mali. Through a one-month field study involving ten transcribers with native
proficiency, we analyze the correction of ASR-generated transcriptions of 53
hours of Bambara voice data. We report that it takes, on average, 30 hours of
human labor to accurately transcribe one hour of speech data under laboratory
conditions and 36 hours under field conditions. The study provides a baseline
and practical insights for a large class of languages with comparable profiles
undertaking the creation of NLP resources.

### [151] [AI Agents for the Dhumbal Card Game: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11736)
*Sahaj Raj Malla*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了Dhumbal文化纸牌游戏中多种AI代理的性能，包括基于规则、搜索和学习的策略，发现基于规则的激进代理在1024轮模拟中获胜率最高（88.3%），优于ISMCTS（9.0%）和PPO（1.5%）等方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI代理在具有文化意义的不完全信息多人纸牌游戏Dhumbal中的表现，为AI研究提供可复现框架，并支持文化游戏的数字保护。

Method: 形式化Dhumbal游戏机制，实现多种AI代理：基于规则的启发式方法（激进、保守、平衡、机会主义）、基于搜索的方法（MCTS、ISMCTS）和强化学习方法（DQN、PPO），通过类别内锦标赛和跨类别锦标赛进行评估。

Result: 在1024轮模拟中，基于规则的激进代理获得最高获胜率88.3%，ISMCTS为9.0%，PPO为1.5%。激进代理通过有效利用Jhyap声明表现出色。

Conclusion: 研究贡献了可复现的AI框架，揭示了不完全信息下启发式方法的有效性，提供了开源代码，推动了AI研究并支持文化游戏的数字保护。

Abstract: This study evaluates Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Dhumbal, a
culturally significant multiplayer card game with imperfect information,
through a systematic comparison of rule-based, search-based, and learning-based
strategies. We formalize Dhumbal's mechanics and implement diverse agents,
including heuristic approaches (Aggressive, Conservative, Balanced,
Opportunistic), search-based methods such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and
Information Set Monte Carlo Tree Search (ISMCTS), and reinforcement learning
approaches including Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO), and a random baseline. Evaluation involves within-category tournaments
followed by a cross-category championship. Performance is measured via win
rate, economic outcome, Jhyap success, cards discarded per round, risk
assessment, and decision efficiency. Statistical significance is assessed using
Welch's t-test with Bonferroni correction, effect sizes via Cohen's d, and 95%
confidence intervals (CI). Across 1024 simulated rounds, the rule-based
Aggressive agent achieves the highest win rate (88.3%, 95% CI: [86.3, 90.3]),
outperforming ISMCTS (9.0%) and PPO (1.5%) through effective exploitation of
Jhyap declarations. The study contributes a reproducible AI framework, insights
into heuristic efficacy under partial information, and open-source code,
thereby advancing AI research and supporting digital preservation of cultural
games.

*Suryaansh Jain,Umair Z. Ahmed,Shubham Sahai,Ben Leong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLM作为评估器存在严重的正向偏见，难以识别无效输出。本文提出了少数否决策略和基于回归的框架来缓解这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估方法存在系统性正向偏见，导致可靠性评分虚高，需要更准确的评估方法。

Method: 提出少数否决策略和基于回归的框架，利用少量人工标注数据直接建模验证器偏见。

Result: 在366个高中Python程序代码反馈任务中，回归方法将最大绝对误差降至1.2%，比14个最先进LLM集成方法提升2倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效缓解LLM评估器的正向偏见，显著提高评估准确性。

Abstract: New Large Language Models (LLMs) become available every few weeks, and modern
application developers confronted with the unenviable task of having to decide
if they should switch to a new model. While human evaluation remains the gold
standard, it is costly and unscalable. The state-of-the-art approach is to use
LLMs as evaluators ( LLM-as-a-judge), but this suffers from a critical flaw:
LLMs exhibit a strong positive bias. We provide empirical evidence showing that
while LLMs can identify valid outputs with high accuracy (i.e., True Positive
Rate 96%), they are remarkably poor at identifying invalid ones (i.e., True
Negative Rate <25%). This systematic bias, coupled with class imbalance, often
leads to inflated reliability scores.
  While ensemble-based methods like majority voting can help, we show that they
are not good enough. We introduce an optimal minority-veto strategy that is
resilient to missing data and mitigates this bias to a large extent. For
scenarios requiring even higher precision, we propose a novel regression-based
framework that directly models the validator bias using a small set of
human-annotated ground truth data. On a challenging code feedback task over 366
high-school Python programs, our regression approach reduces the maximum
absolute error to just 1.2%, achieving a 2x improvement over the
best-performing ensemble of 14 state-of-the-art LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL)来解决AI智能体评估的挑战，包括标准化评估框架、三维分析方法和LLM辅助日志检查，旨在推动从基准测试表现转向真实世界可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体评估存在诸多挑战，影响了对智能体实际性能的理解，需要更全面和标准化的评估方法。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架：在数百个VM上并行评估，将评估时间从数周缩短到数小时；2. 三维分析：涵盖模型、支架和基准三个维度；3. LLM辅助日志检查：发现未报告的行为模式。

Result: 进行了21,730次智能体运行，涵盖9个模型和9个基准测试（编码、网页导航、科学、客服），成本约4万美元。发现意外洞察，如更高推理努力在多数运行中反而降低准确性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化智能体评估方法并解决常见陷阱，希望推动研究重点从基准测试表现转向真实世界可靠性，并共享了包含25亿token的智能体日志以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

*Owen Queen,Harrison G. Zhang,James Zou*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CGBench是一个用于评估语言模型在科学文献解释能力的基准测试，基于临床遗传学专家标注数据构建，测试模型提取实验结果、评估证据强度、分类实验成果的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基因变异解释方法耗时费力，生成式语言模型可加速这一过程，但现有基准测试任务过于狭窄，无法反映真实研究需求。

Method: 基于ClinGen专家标注的临床遗传学文献构建CGBench基准，测试8种不同语言模型在三个核心任务上的表现：精确提取实验结果、判断证据强度、分类描述实验成果。

Result: 模型在文献解释方面表现出潜力但存在显著差距，推理模型在细粒度任务上表现更好，非推理模型在高层次解释上更优。模型即使正确分类证据也常产生幻觉或误解结果。

Conclusion: CGBench揭示了语言模型在科学文献精确解释方面的优势和局限，为AI在临床遗传学和更广泛科学领域的未来研究开辟了道路。

Abstract: Variant and gene interpretation are fundamental to personalized medicine and
translational biomedicine. However, traditional approaches are manual and
labor-intensive. Generative language models (LMs) can facilitate this process,
accelerating the translation of fundamental research into clinically-actionable
insights. While existing benchmarks have attempted to quantify the capabilities
of LMs for interpreting scientific data, these studies focus on narrow tasks
that do not translate to real-world research. To meet these challenges, we
introduce CGBench, a robust benchmark that tests reasoning capabilities of LMs
on scientific publications. CGBench is built from ClinGen, a resource of
expert-curated literature interpretations in clinical genetics. CGBench
measures the ability to 1) extract relevant experimental results following
precise protocols and guidelines, 2) judge the strength of evidence, and 3)
categorize and describe the relevant outcome of experiments. We test 8
different LMs and find that while models show promise, substantial gaps exist
in literature interpretation, especially on fine-grained instructions.
Reasoning models excel in fine-grained tasks but non-reasoning models are
better at high-level interpretations. Finally, we measure LM explanations
against human explanations with an LM judge approach, revealing that models
often hallucinate or misinterpret results even when correctly classifying
evidence. CGBench reveals strengths and weaknesses of LMs for precise
interpretation of scientific publications, opening avenues for future research
in AI for clinical genetics and science more broadly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种基于扩散模型思想的两阶段训练方法，使LLM能够生成有效的顺序澄清问题来揭示用户偏好，从而改善推荐系统的个性化交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在用户历史有限的情况下，通过生成有效的顺序澄清问题来获取更多用户偏好信息，以个性化LLM推荐系统的响应。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程：前向过程从用户画像生成澄清问题并逐步移除答案作为"噪声"；反向过程训练模型通过提问有效澄清问题来"去噪"用户画像。

Result: 该方法显著提高了LLM提出漏斗式问题和有效获取用户偏好的能力。

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型思想的顺序问题生成方法能够有效提升LLM在推荐系统中获取用户偏好的能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made it possible for recommendation systems
to interact with users in open-ended conversational interfaces. In order to
personalize LLM responses, it is crucial to elicit user preferences, especially
when there is limited user history. One way to get more information is to
present clarifying questions to the user. However, generating effective
sequential clarifying questions across various domains remains a challenge. To
address this, we introduce a novel approach for training LLMs to ask sequential
questions that reveal user preferences. Our method follows a two-stage process
inspired by diffusion models. Starting from a user profile, the forward process
generates clarifying questions to obtain answers and then removes those answers
step by step, serving as a way to add ``noise'' to the user profile. The
reverse process involves training a model to ``denoise'' the user profile by
learning to ask effective clarifying questions. Our results show that our
method significantly improves the LLM's proficiency in asking funnel questions
and eliciting user preferences effectively.

*Chathurangi Shyalika,Aryaman Sharma,Fadi El Kalach,Utkarshani Jaimini,Cory Henson,Ramy Harik,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalTrace是一个集成到工业CoPilot中的神经符号因果分析模块，通过数据驱动因果分析和工业知识图谱提供因果发现、反事实推理和根因分析功能，在火箭组装测试中表现出与领域专家高度一致的分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造环境不仅需要准确预测，还需要可解释的异常处理、根因分析和干预建议。现有AI系统往往是孤立的黑盒，缺乏预测、解释和因果推理的无缝集成，限制了在高风险工业环境中的可信度和实用性。

Method: 开发CausalTrace神经符号因果分析模块，集成到SmartPilot工业CoPilot中，通过数据驱动因果分析结合工业本体和知识图谱，支持因果发现、反事实推理和根因分析，并提供实时操作员交互。

Result: 在学术火箭组装测试中，CausalTrace与领域专家达成高度一致（ROUGE-1: 0.91），根因分析性能强劲（MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92），在C3AN评估中获得4.59/5分，展示了实时部署的精确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: CausalTrace成功地将神经符号因果分析集成到工业CoPilot中，提供了透明、可解释的决策支持，解决了现有AI系统在制造环境中的黑盒问题，为高风险工业应用提供了可信赖的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing environments demand not only accurate predictions but
also interpretable insights to process anomalies, root causes, and potential
interventions. Existing AI systems often function as isolated black boxes,
lacking the seamless integration of prediction, explanation, and causal
reasoning required for a unified decision-support solution. This fragmentation
limits their trustworthiness and practical utility in high-stakes industrial
environments. In this work, we present CausalTrace, a neurosymbolic causal
analysis module integrated into the SmartPilot industrial CoPilot. CausalTrace
performs data-driven causal analysis enriched by industrial ontologies and
knowledge graphs, including advanced functions such as causal discovery,
counterfactual reasoning, and root cause analysis (RCA). It supports real-time
operator interaction and is designed to complement existing agents by offering
transparent, explainable decision support. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation of CausalTrace using multiple causal assessment methods and the C3AN
framework (i.e. Custom, Compact, Composite AI with Neurosymbolic Integration),
which spans principles of robustness, intelligence, and trustworthiness. In an
academic rocket assembly testbed, CausalTrace achieved substantial agreement
with domain experts (ROUGE-1: 0.91 in ontology QA) and strong RCA performance
(MAP@3: 94%, PR@2: 97%, MRR: 0.92, Jaccard: 0.92). It also attained 4.59/5 in
the C3AN evaluation, demonstrating precision and reliability for live
deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PACT是一个评估LLM生成代码合约遵循性的框架，通过扩展HumanEval+和MBPP+基准，提供合约违反测试用例，并引入新指标来量化合约遵循性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准主要评估功能正确性，但忽略了软件合约遵循性这一关键方面，导致无法衡量模型生成的代码是否真正健壮可靠。

Method: 构建专注于合约违反的测试套件语料库，扩展现有基准；系统分析不同提示条件下的代码生成；引入新指标量化合约遵循性。

Result: 研究表明，在提示中加入合约违反测试用例能显著提升模型对合约的遵循能力，优于仅使用合约描述的方法。

Conclusion: PACT通过揭示传统基准忽略的关键错误，提供了评估LLM生成代码在功能和合约遵循性方面稳健性的严格且可解释的指标。

Abstract: Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+,
primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional
correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of
real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity
constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical
oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models
consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We
introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation
framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to
systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code
snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold:
First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract
violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic
analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis
demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases
significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using
contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously
quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By
revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides
the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of
LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence.Our
code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种地理空间感知层(GAL)，将大型语言模型与结构化地球数据相结合，通过整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气信息，为灾害响应提供基于证据的资源分配建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统计方法缺乏语义上下文，跨事件泛化能力差，可解释性有限。大型语言模型虽然具有少样本泛化能力，但受限于文本且缺乏地理感知。

Method: 开发地理空间感知层(GAL)，从原始野火检测开始，自动从外部地理数据库检索并整合基础设施、人口、地形和天气信息，组装成带单位注释的感知脚本。

Result: 在真实野火场景中评估，地理空间接地的智能体能够超越基线模型，产生基于证据的资源分配建议。

Conclusion: 该框架可泛化到其他灾害如洪水和飓风，为灾害响应提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective disaster response is essential for safeguarding lives and property.
Existing statistical approaches often lack semantic context, generalize poorly
across events, and offer limited interpretability. While Large language models
(LLMs) provide few-shot generalization, they remain text-bound and blind to
geography. To bridge this gap, we introduce a Geospatial Awareness Layer (GAL)
that grounds LLM agents in structured earth data. Starting from raw wildfire
detections, GAL automatically retrieves and integrates infrastructure,
demographic, terrain, and weather information from external geodatabases,
assembling them into a concise, unit-annotated perception script. This enriched
context enables agents to produce evidence-based resource-allocation
recommendations (e.g., personnel assignments, budget allocations), further
reinforced by historical analogs and daily change signals for incremental
updates. We evaluate the framework in real wildfire scenarios across multiple
LLM models, showing that geospatially grounded agents can outperform baselines.
The proposed framework can generalize to other hazards such as floods and
hurricanes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkPilot是一个无需训练即可自动优化大型推理模型推理过程的框架，通过进化过程生成think-prefixes来引导模型实现更优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然强大，但仍存在推理效率低下和目标不准确的问题。现有的免训练方法要么依赖僵化的启发式规则，要么只能提供描述性但不可操作的分析。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes，这些前缀指令在推理行为分类学的驱动下演化，引导模型朝着更优性能发展。

Result: ThinkPilot显著改善了准确率-长度权衡，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），并增强了指令跟随能力。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠地控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好。ThinkPilot通过自动识别和激发这些行为，为将模型推理与任务需求对齐提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文重新诠释了AI智能体中的学习角色，将其视为具备计算能力的随机动力系统，强调时间在学习推理中的基础作用，并提出从归纳学习转向转导学习的范式转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI推理智能体是否具有通用性，能否解决任何可计算任务，以及学习推理的关键因素——是模型规模还是训练数据规模。

Method: 将AI智能体重新解释为计算能力的随机动力系统，提出转导学习范式，关注算法结构而非数据分布，强调时间在优化中的核心作用。

Result: 理论推导了推理时间与训练时间的幂律缩放关系，证明模型规模扩展可能导致智能体成为仅靠蛮力解决问题的"专家"而非真正智能。

Conclusion: 在扩展推理模型时，应优化的关键量是时间而非准确性，时间在学习中的关键作用迄今仅被间接考虑。

Abstract: AI reasoning agents are already able to solve a variety of tasks by deploying
tools, simulating outcomes of multiple hypotheses and reflecting on them. In
doing so, they perform computation, although not in the classical sense --
there is no program being executed. Still, if they perform computation, can AI
agents be universal? Can chain-of-thought reasoning solve any computable task?
How does an AI Agent learn to reason? Is it a matter of model size? Or training
dataset size?
  In this work, we reinterpret the role of learning in the context of AI
Agents, viewing them as compute-capable stochastic dynamical systems, and
highlight the role of time in a foundational principle for learning to reason.
In doing so, we propose a shift from classical inductive learning to
transductive learning -- where the objective is not to approximate the
distribution of past data, but to capture their algorithmic structure to reduce
the time needed to find solutions to new tasks.
  Transductive learning suggests that, counter to Shannon's theory, a key role
of information in learning is about reduction of time rather than
reconstruction error. In particular, we show that the optimal speed-up that a
universal solver can achieve using past data is tightly related to their
algorithmic information. Using this, we show a theoretical derivation for the
observed power-law scaling of inference time versus training time. We then show
that scaling model size can lead to behaviors that, while improving accuracy on
benchmarks, fail any reasonable test of intelligence, let alone
super-intelligence: In the limit of infinite space and time, large models can
behave as savants, able to brute-force through any task without any insight.
Instead, we argue that the key quantity to optimize when scaling reasoning
models is time, whose critical role in learning has so far only been indirectly
considered.

TL;DR: HiCoTraj是一个使用LLM进行零样本人口统计推理的框架，通过分层思维链提示从轨迹数据推断年龄、性别、收入等人口属性，无需标注训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于移动轨迹的人口统计推断方法严重依赖带标注的大规模轨迹数据，导致可解释性差且跨数据集泛化能力不足。

Method: 将轨迹转换为语义丰富的自然语言表示，创建详细活动记录和多尺度访问摘要，然后通过分层思维链推理（事实特征提取、行为模式分析、结构化输出的人口统计推断）引导LLM。

Result: 在真实世界轨迹数据上的实验评估表明，HiCoTraj在零样本场景下对多个人口统计属性实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: HiCoTraj解决了标注人口统计数据稀缺的问题，同时提供了透明的推理链，展示了LLM在零样本人口统计推理方面的潜力。

Abstract: Inferring demographic attributes such as age, sex, or income level from human
mobility patterns enables critical applications such as targeted public health
interventions, equitable urban planning, and personalized transportation
services. Existing mobility-based demographic inference studies heavily rely on
large-scale trajectory data with demographic labels, leading to limited
interpretability and poor generalizability across different datasets and user
groups. We propose HiCoTraj (Zero-Shot Demographic Reasoning via Hierarchical
Chain-of-Thought Prompting from Trajectory), a framework that leverages LLMs'
zero-shot learning and semantic understanding capabilities to perform
demographic inference without labeled training data. HiCoTraj transforms
trajectories into semantically rich, natural language representations by
creating detailed activity chronicles and multi-scale visiting summaries. Then
HiCoTraj uses a novel hierarchical chain of thought reasoning to systematically
guide LLMs through three cognitive stages: factual feature extraction,
behavioral pattern analysis, and demographic inference with structured output.
This approach addresses the scarcity challenge of labeled demographic data
while providing transparent reasoning chains. Experimental evaluation on
real-world trajectory data demonstrates that HiCoTraj achieves competitive
performance across multiple demographic attributes in zero-shot scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了EmboMatrix训练场概念，通过大规模任务模拟和精确奖励，让LLM获得真正的具身决策能力，并训练出超越DeepSeek-R1的EmboBrain模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM缺乏物理环境暴露的问题，使其能够真正理解具身决策，实现通用具身智能。

Method: 构建EmboMatrix训练场基础设施，包含多智能体数据引擎生成大规模任务场景、分布式异构硬件系统实现可扩展模拟、多级奖励架构提供精确监督。

Result: 训练出的EmboBrain-7B在具身决策基准上比671B的DeepSeek-R1高出9.5%。

Conclusion: 交互式、环境基础的学习对于构建真正智能的具身代理具有强大效果。

Abstract: Embodied decision-making enables agents to translate high-level goals into
executable actions through continuous interactions within the physical world,
forming a cornerstone of general-purpose embodied intelligence. Large language
models (LLMs), with their general decision-making capabilities, offer a
promising path to realize this potential; however, LLMs trained solely on
language lack exposure to physical environments, limiting their true embodied
understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose the concept of a training ground:
a comprehensive infrastructure that provides task and scene simulation,
embodied interaction, and feedback signals, offering a one-stop solution for
LLM acquire genuine embodied decision-making skills. In this work, we present
EmboMatrix, the first training ground of its kind, providing massive and
diverse tasks with efficient simulation and precise rewards. EmboMatrix
incorporates a series of novel techniques: a multi-agent data engine for
large-scale task and scene generation, a distributed heterogeneous-hardware
system for scalable simulation, and a multi-level reward architecture for
precise supervision. Leveraging EmboMatrix, we cultivate EmboBrain, an LLM
whose embodied decision-making abilities emerge from extensive embodied
interactions. Experiments show that EmboBrain-7B surpasses the 671B DeepSeek-R1
baseline by 9.5\% on two challenging embodied decision-making benchmarks,
demonstrating the power of interactive, environment-grounded learning for
building truly intelligent embodied agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BeSTAD是一个无监督框架，通过联合建模空间上下文和时间动态来检测人类移动数据中的个体级异常，能够在大规模人群中捕获个性化行为特征并发现细粒度异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统异常检测主要关注轨迹级分析，而检测个体级异常（即个人移动行为相对于自身历史模式的异常偏差）在大规模数据集中仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: BeSTAD学习语义丰富的移动表示，整合位置含义和时间模式，采用行为聚类感知建模机制，从正常活动中构建个性化行为档案，并通过跨时期行为比较识别异常。

Result: 该方法能够检测行为转变和与既定惯例的偏差，并识别在大规模移动数据集中表现出此类变化的个体。

Conclusion: 通过直接从无标签数据中学习个体行为，BeSTAD将异常检测推向个性化和可解释的移动分析。

Abstract: Traditional anomaly detection in human mobility has primarily focused on
trajectory-level analysis, identifying statistical outliers or spatiotemporal
inconsistencies across aggregated movement traces. However, detecting
individual-level anomalies, i.e., unusual deviations in a person's mobility
behavior relative to their own historical patterns, within datasets
encompassing large populations remains a significant challenge. In this paper,
we present BeSTAD (Behavior-aware Spatio-Temporal Anomaly Detection for Human
Mobility Data), an unsupervised framework that captures individualized
behavioral signatures across large populations and uncovers fine-grained
anomalies by jointly modeling spatial context and temporal dynamics. BeSTAD
learns semantically enriched mobility representations that integrate location
meaning and temporal patterns, enabling the detection of subtle deviations in
individual movement behavior. BeSTAD further employs a behavior-cluster-aware
modeling mechanism that builds personalized behavioral profiles from normal
activity and identifies anomalies through cross-period behavioral comparison
with consistent semantic alignment. Building on prior work in mobility behavior
clustering, this approach enables not only the detection of behavioral shifts
and deviations from established routines but also the identification of
individuals exhibiting such changes within large-scale mobility datasets. By
learning individual behaviors directly from unlabeled data, BeSTAD advances
anomaly detection toward personalized and interpretable mobility analysis.

*Rabimba Karanjai,Yang Lu,Ranjith Chodavarapu,Lei Xu,Weidong Shi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型处理随机性任务的能力，发现虽然LLM能产生一定随机性的输出，但表现不稳定且与预期行为有显著偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM技术的快速发展，许多应用（如随机决策、游戏、调度、AI代理和密码学任务）都需要随机性，但LLM处理随机性的能力尚不明确。

Method: 设计了一系列实验，考虑外部工具可访问性、任务类型、模型状态（新鲜vs非新鲜）和提示策略等因素，涵盖生成随机数、随机字符串、项目洗牌以及使用熵和NIST随机性测试套件评估随机性质量等任务。

Result: LLM生成的输出虽然表现出一定程度的随机性，但其性能不一致，且经常显著偏离预期行为。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明LLM在处理涉及随机性的任务时存在关键局限性，需要在这些方面进行改进才能有效处理随机性任务。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language model (LLM) technology has led to
diverse applications, many of which inherently require randomness, such as
stochastic decision-making, gaming, scheduling, AI agents, and
cryptography-related tasks. However, the capabilities of LLMs in handling
randomness, particularly in generating and utilizing random numbers
effectively, remain unclear. This paper investigates the capacity of LLMs for
handling tasks that involve randomness through a series of experiments. We
designed a set of experiments that consider various factors that can influence
an LLM's performance in tasks involving randomness, such as accessibility to
external tools, types of tasks, model states (fresh vs. non-fresh), and
prompting strategies. The experiments cover a range of tasks, including
generating random numbers, generating random strings such as passwords,
shuffling items, and evaluating the quality of randomness using entropy and the
NIST randomness test-suite. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate
outputs that exhibit some degree of randomness, their performance is
inconsistent and often deviates significantly from the expected behavior. The
analysis of the experimental results highlights key limitations and areas where
improvement is needed for the LLMs to effectively handle tasks involving
randomness

TL;DR: OneLife框架通过条件激活的程序化法则在概率编程框架中建模世界动态，能够在复杂随机环境中从有限的非指导性交互中学习关键环境动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在复杂、随机环境中，智能体只有"一次生命"来探索敌对环境且无人指导的现实挑战性场景下的符号世界建模问题。

Method: 使用条件激活的程序化法则，采用前提-效果结构，在相关世界状态中激活，创建动态计算图，仅通过相关法则进行推理和优化。

Result: 在23个测试场景中的16个上优于强基线，能够从最少、无指导的交互中成功学习关键环境动态，模拟推演成功识别出更优策略。

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Abstract: We introduce ToPolyAgent, a multi-agent AI framework for performing
coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of topological polymers
through natural language instructions. By integrating large language models
(LLMs) with domain-specific computational tools, ToPolyAgent supports both
interactive and autonomous simulation workflows across diverse polymer
architectures, including linear, ring, brush, and star polymers, as well as
dendrimers. The system consists of four LLM-powered agents: a Config Agent for
generating initial polymer-solvent configurations, a Simulation Agent for
executing LAMMPS-based MD simulations and conformational analyses, a Report
Agent for compiling markdown reports, and a Workflow Agent for streamlined
autonomous operations. Interactive mode incorporates user feedback loops for
iterative refinements, while autonomous mode enables end-to-end task execution
from detailed prompts. We demonstrate ToPolyAgent's versatility through case
studies involving diverse polymer architectures under varying solvent
condition, thermostats, and simulation lengths. Furthermore, we highlight its
potential as a research assistant by directing it to investigate the effect of
interaction parameters on the linear polymer conformation, and the influence of
grafting density on the persistence length of the brush polymer. By coupling
natural language interfaces with rigorous simulation tools, ToPolyAgent lowers
barriers to complex computational workflows and advances AI-driven materials
discovery in polymer science. It lays the foundation for autonomous and
extensible multi-agent scientific research ecosystems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种精确控制LLM输出属性强度的方法，将属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题，通过训练轻量级价值函数和梯度干预实现精细控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM对齐方法只能提供方向性或开放式指导，无法可靠实现精确的属性强度控制，需要更精细的控制方法以适应不同用户期望

Method: 1) 将精确属性强度控制重新定义为目标达成问题；2) 通过时序差分学习训练轻量级价值函数预测属性强度；3) 对隐藏表示进行梯度干预以精确导航到特定属性强度目标

Result: 在LLaMA-3.2-3b和Phi-4-mini上的实验证实了该方法能够以高精度引导文本生成达到用户指定的属性强度

Conclusion: 该方法实现了对属性强度的细粒度连续控制，超越了简单的方向对齐，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似和优化、对齐行为蒸馏等下游任务中展示了效率提升

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学推理方面表现出色，但在材料科学领域的推理能力尚未充分探索，需要建立专门的基准测试来评估和推动改进。

Method: 构建了包含1340个问题的材料科学基准测试，采用结构化分类和三级难度体系，评估了多种推理策略（基础思维链、工具增强、自我修正）和检索增强生成方法。

Result: 即使是表现最佳的Gemini-2.5-Pro模型在大学水平材料科学问题上的准确率也不到80%，表明MatSciBench具有很高的复杂性。不同推理策略在不同场景下表现各异，没有单一方法在所有情况下都表现优异。

Conclusion: MatSciBench为评估和提升LLMs在材料科学领域的科学推理能力建立了一个全面而坚实的基准，揭示了当前模型在该领域的局限性，并为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in
scientific reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in materials science
remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce MatSciBench, a
comprehensive college-level benchmark comprising 1,340 problems that span the
essential subdisciplines of materials science. MatSciBench features a
structured and fine-grained taxonomy that categorizes materials science
questions into 6 primary fields and 31 sub-fields, and includes a three-tier
difficulty classification based on the reasoning length required to solve each
question. MatSciBench provides detailed reference solutions enabling precise
error analysis and incorporates multimodal reasoning through visual contexts in
numerous questions. Evaluations of leading models reveal that even the
highest-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves under 80% accuracy on
college-level materials science questions, highlighting the complexity of
MatSciBench. Our systematic analysis of different reasoning strategie--basic
chain-of-thought, tool augmentation, and self-correction--demonstrates that no
single method consistently excels across all scenarios. We further analyze
performance by difficulty level, examine trade-offs between efficiency and
accuracy, highlight the challenges inherent in multimodal reasoning tasks,
analyze failure modes across LLMs and reasoning methods, and evaluate the
influence of retrieval-augmented generation. MatSciBench thus establishes a
comprehensive and solid benchmark for assessing and driving improvements in the
scientific reasoning capabilities of LLMs within the materials science domain.

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language
Model Meta AI) series - from LLaMA 1 through LLaMA 4 and the specialized
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B
parameters), their architectures (including native multimodal and
Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，人们对既高性能又可理解的智能系统需求增加。当前XAI系统评估过程过于技术化，未能充分关注人类用户需求，因此需要用户研究来指导XAI开发。

Method: 对65项XAI用户研究进行综合分析，提出XAI系统特性和以人为中心的评估指标分类，并根据用户AI专业知识水平扩展设计目标框架。

Result: 发现XAI系统由核心系统和解释部分构成；评估指标可分为情感、认知、可用性、可解释性和解释指标；针对AI新手强调负责任使用、接受度和可用性，针对数据专家强调人机协作和任务性能。

Conclusion: 提供了XAI评估和设计框架的扩展，强调需要根据用户特征定制XAI系统设计目标，以更好地满足不同用户群体的需求。

Abstract: As AI becomes more common in everyday living, there is an increasing demand
for intelligent systems that are both performant and understandable.
Explainable AI (XAI) systems aim to provide comprehensible explanations of
decisions and predictions. At present, however, evaluation processes are rather
technical and not sufficiently focused on the needs of human users.
Consequently, evaluation studies involving human users can serve as a valuable
guide for conducting user studies. This paper presents a comprehensive review
of 65 user studies evaluating XAI systems across different domains and
application contexts. As a guideline for XAI developers, we provide a holistic
overview of the properties of XAI systems and evaluation metrics focused on
human users (human-centered). We propose objectives for the human-centered
design (design goals) of XAI systems. To incorporate users' specific
characteristics, design goals are adapted to users with different levels of AI
expertise (AI novices and data experts). In this regard, we provide an
extension to existing XAI evaluation and design frameworks. The first part of
our results includes the analysis of XAI system characteristics. An important
finding is the distinction between the core system and the XAI explanation,
which together form the whole system. Further results include the distinction
of evaluation metrics into affection towards the system, cognition, usability,
interpretability, and explanation metrics. Furthermore, the users, along with
their specific characteristics and behavior, can be assessed. For AI novices,
the relevant extended design goals include responsible use, acceptance, and
usability. For data experts, the focus is performance-oriented and includes
human-AI collaboration and system and user task performance.

TL;DR: GOAT是一个无需人工标注的训练框架，能够从API文档自动构建目标导向的API执行任务数据集，通过微调使开源LLM代理在复杂工具使用和推理方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理在处理目标导向查询时能力有限，需要将高级目标分解为多个相互依赖的API调用并进行正确规划和执行。开源模型在复杂工具使用方面表现不佳，而闭源模型虽然推理能力强但缺乏训练数据。

Method: 提出GOAT训练框架，从API文档自动构建合成数据集，在无需人工标注的情况下微调LLM代理，使其能够推理相互依赖的调用并生成连贯响应。

Result: GOAT训练的代理在多个现有目标导向基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在新提出的GOATBench基准测试中也表现出色。

Conclusion: GOAT为构建能够进行复杂推理和工具使用的强大开源LLM代理提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been extended beyond traditional
text generation to serve as interactive agents capable of using external tools
based on user intent. However, current LLM agents still show limited ability to
handle goal-oriented queries, which require decomposing a high-level objective
into multiple interdependent API calls with correct planning and execution.
Current approaches mainly rely on zero-shot evaluation due to the absence of
training data. While proprietary closed-source models such as GPT-4 demonstrate
strong reasoning abilities, smaller open-source models struggle to perform
complex tool use effectively. Thus, we propose a novel training framework GOAT,
which enables fine-tuning of LLM agents in a human annotation-free setting.
GOAT automatically constructs synthetic datasets of goal-oriented API execution
tasks directly from given API documents, equipping models with the ability to
reason over interdependent calls and generate coherent responses. Through
extensive experiments, we show that GOAT-trained agents achieve
state-of-the-art performance across multiple existing goal-oriented benchmarks.
In addition, we introduce GOATBench, a new goal-oriented API execution
benchmark, and demonstrate that agents trained with GOAT also excel in this
setting. These results highlight GOAT as a practical path toward building
robust open-source LLM agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖事后回顾完整对话记录，无法捕捉医疗对话的动态性和上下文敏感性，以及患者不断变化的信息需求。

Method: 使用知识图谱驱动患者模拟机制，构建控制模块从知识图谱检索相关医学事实；采用实时轮次评估框架，通过法官代理评估每个模型响应的临床适当性、事实正确性和安全性；整合开源资源和专家标注数据集构建知识图谱。

Result: 构建了包含8个最先进LLM的全面多轮基准测试，证明MedKGEval能够识别传统评估管道经常忽略的细微行为缺陷和安全风险。

Conclusion: MedKGEval框架能够有效评估临床LLM在多轮医疗对话中的表现，虽然最初针对中英文医疗应用设计，但可通过切换输入知识图谱轻松扩展到其他语言。

Abstract: The reliable evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in medical
applications remains an open challenge, particularly in capturing the
complexity of multi-turn doctor-patient interactions that unfold in real
clinical environments. Existing evaluation methods typically rely on post hoc
review of full conversation transcripts, thereby neglecting the dynamic,
context-sensitive nature of medical dialogues and the evolving informational
needs of patients. In this work, we present MedKGEval, a novel multi-turn
evaluation framework for clinical LLMs grounded in structured medical
knowledge. Our approach introduces three key contributions: (1) a knowledge
graph-driven patient simulation mechanism, where a dedicated control module
retrieves relevant medical facts from a curated knowledge graph, thereby
endowing the patient agent with human-like and realistic conversational
behavior. This knowledge graph is constructed by integrating open-source
resources with additional triples extracted from expert-annotated datasets; (2)
an in-situ, turn-level evaluation framework, where each model response is
assessed by a Judge Agent for clinical appropriateness, factual correctness,
and safety as the dialogue progresses using a suite of fine-grained,
task-specific metrics; (3) a comprehensive multi-turn benchmark of eight
state-of-the-art LLMs, demonstrating MedKGEval's ability to identify subtle
behavioral flaws and safety risks that are often overlooked by conventional
evaluation pipelines. Although initially designed for Chinese and English
medical applications, our framework can be readily extended to additional
languages by switching the input knowledge graphs, ensuring seamless bilingual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在特定领域部署时需要领域适配，但手动提示设计耗时且依赖专家知识，现有自动方法缺乏动态策略选择和细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 提出PromptFlow框架，包含元提示、操作符、优化器和评估器模块，采用基于梯度的元学习和强化学习来回收经验，自动探索最优提示优化路径。

Conclusion: PromptFlow为自动提示工程提供了有效的模块化解决方案，通过元学习和经验回收机制显著提升了提示优化的效率和效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated profound impact on Natural
Language Processing (NLP) tasks. However, their effective deployment across
diverse domains often require domain-specific adaptation strategies, as generic
models may underperform when faced with specialized data distributions. Recent
advances in prompt engineering (PE) offer a promising alternative to extensive
retraining by refining input instructions to align LLM outputs with task
objectives. This paradigm has emerged as a rapid and versatile approach for
model fine-tuning. Despite its potential, manual prompt design remains
labor-intensive and heavily depends on specialized expertise, often requiring
iterative human effort to achieve optimal formulations. To address this
limitation, automated prompt engineering methodologies have been developed to
systematically generate task-specific prompts. However, current implementations
predominantly employ static update rules and lack mechanisms for dynamic
strategy selection, resulting in suboptimal adaptation to varying NLP task
requirements. Furthermore, most methods treat and update the whole prompts at
each step, without considering editing prompt sections at a finer granularity.
At last, in particular, the problem of how to recycle experience in LLM is
still underexplored. To this end, we propose the PromptFlow, a modular training
framework inspired by TensorFlow, which integrates meta-prompts, operators,
optimization, and evaluator. Our framework can be equipped with the latest
optimization methods and autonomously explores optimal prompt refinement
trajectories through gradient-based meta-learning, requiring minimal
task-specific training data. Specifically, we devise a reinforcement learning
method to recycle experience for LLM in the PE process. Finally, we conduct
extensive experiments on various datasets, and demonstrate the effectiveness of
PromptFlow.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出T³方法，通过检测和截断信念偏差过大的轨迹来改善LLM主动推理训练，提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在主动推理中容易出现信念偏差，导致问题状态跟踪失败和重复无效动作，而强化学习训练无法正确归因关键探索步骤

Method: 提出T³方法，跟踪模型信念偏差，检测过度的信念偏差并在训练时截断轨迹，移除无信息的部分，保留信息前缀的功劳

Result: 在5个挑战性任务中，T³持续提升训练稳定性、token效率和最终性能，获得高达30%的性能增益，同时减少约25%的rollout tokens

Conclusion: 信念控制是开发鲁棒且可泛化的LLM主动推理器的关键原则

Abstract: Active reasoning requires large language models (LLMs) to interact with
external sources and strategically gather information to solve problems.
Central to this process is belief tracking: maintaining a coherent
understanding of the problem state and the missing information toward the
solution. However, due to limited reasoning capabilities, LLM-based agents
often suffer from belief deviation: they struggle to correctly model beliefs,
lose track of problem states, and fall into uninformative or repetitive
actions. Once this happens, errors compound and reinforcement learning (RL)
training fails to properly credit the crucial exploratory steps. To address
this issue, we propose to track the deviation of model beliefs and develop
$\mathbf{T^3}$, a simple yet effective method that detects excessive belief
deviation and truncates trajectories during training to remove uninformative
tails. By preserving credit for informative prefixes, $\mathbf{T^3}$
systematically improves policy optimization. Across 5 challenging tasks,
$\mathbf{T^3}$ consistently enhances training stability, token efficiency, and
final performance, achieving up to 30% gains while cutting rollout tokens by
roughly 25%. These results highlight belief control as a key principle for
developing robust and generalizable LLM-based active reasoners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI工具如PyTorch缺乏自动推理支持，而传统AI语言如LISP缺乏可扩展性和学习能力，需要一种统一解决方案。

Method: 基于张量方程构建张量逻辑语言，将逻辑规则与爱因斯坦求和视为相同操作，实现神经、符号和统计AI的统一表达。

Result: 成功实现了transformer、形式推理、核机器和图模型等关键AI形式，并支持嵌入空间中的可靠推理。

Conclusion: 张量逻辑结合了神经网络的可扩展性和符号推理的可靠性，为AI的广泛采用提供了潜在基础。

Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the
requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic
differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python,
which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning
and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts
to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack
scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a
language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a
fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation,
based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are
essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how
to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in
tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and
graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible,
such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and
learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of
symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.

TL;DR: RAG-Anything是一个统一的多模态检索增强生成框架，能够跨文本、视觉、表格和数学表达式等多种模态进行知识检索，解决了现有RAG系统仅限于文本内容的局限性。


<details>

Conclusion: 该框架为多模态知识访问建立了新范式，消除了限制当前系统的架构碎片化问题，实现了对异构内容的有效推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a fundamental paradigm
for expanding Large Language Models beyond their static training limitations.
However, a critical misalignment exists between current RAG capabilities and
real-world information environments. Modern knowledge repositories are
inherently multimodal, containing rich combinations of textual content, visual
elements, structured tables, and mathematical expressions. Yet existing RAG
frameworks are limited to textual content, creating fundamental gaps when
processing multimodal documents. We present RAG-Anything, a unified framework
that enables comprehensive knowledge retrieval across all modalities. Our
approach reconceptualizes multimodal content as interconnected knowledge
entities rather than isolated data types. The framework introduces dual-graph
construction to capture both cross-modal relationships and textual semantics
within a unified representation. We develop cross-modal hybrid retrieval that
combines structural knowledge navigation with semantic matching. This enables
effective reasoning over heterogeneous content where relevant evidence spans
multiple modalities. RAG-Anything demonstrates superior performance on
challenging multimodal benchmarks, achieving significant improvements over
state-of-the-art methods. Performance gains become particularly pronounced on
long documents where traditional approaches fail. Our framework establishes a
new paradigm for multimodal knowledge access, eliminating the architectural
fragmentation that constrains current systems. Our framework is open-sourced

Motivation: 解决LLM在数学研究中验证困难的问题，探索AI如何超越竞赛数学成为专业数学家的研究工具，特别是回答Terence Tao提出的关于LLM与验证器结合能否证明复杂渐进不等式的问题。

Method: 使用LLM+CAS框架，其中LLM建议域分解，CAS（如Mathematica）对每个部分进行公理化验证，通过上下文符号反馈循环迭代改进证明。

Result: 该框架在提出适当域分解方面表现出显著效果，能够有效处理复杂的渐进不等式证明问题。

Conclusion: LLM+CAS框架成功展示了AI可以超越竞赛数学，成为专业数学家的研究级工具，特别是在渐进分析领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated advanced capabilities in
solving IMO and Putnam problems; yet their role in research mathematics has
remained fairly limited. The key difficulty is verification: suggested proofs
may look plausible, but cannot be trusted without rigorous checking. We present
a framework, called LLM+CAS, and an associated tool, O-Forge, that couples
frontier LLMs with a computer algebra systems (CAS) in an In-Context Symbolic
Feedback loop to produce proofs that are both creative and symbolically
verified. Our focus is on asymptotic inequalities, a topic that often involves
difficult proofs and appropriate decomposition of the domain into the "right"
subdomains. Many mathematicians, including Terry Tao, have suggested that using
AI tools to find the right decompositions can be very useful for research-level
asymptotic analysis. In this paper, we show that our framework LLM+CAS turns
out to be remarkably effective at proposing such decompositions via a
combination of a frontier LLM and a CAS. More precisely, we use an LLM to
suggest domain decomposition, and a CAS (such as Mathematica) that provides a
verification of each piece axiomatically. Using this loop, we answer a question
posed by Terence Tao: whether LLMs coupled with a verifier can be used to help
prove intricate asymptotic inequalities. More broadly, we show how AI can move
beyond contest math towards research-level tools for professional
mathematicians.

TL;DR: 这篇论文对基于大语言模型的Vibe Coding范式进行了首次系统性综述，建立了理论框架和实践模型，揭示了成功实施Vibe Coding的关键要素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，编程范式从代码生成辅助转向自主编程代理，催生了'Vibe Coding'新方法，但其有效性尚未得到充分探索，存在生产力损失和协作挑战。

Method: 通过系统分析1000多篇研究论文，建立约束马尔可夫决策过程理论框架，并综合现有实践形成五种开发模型分类。

Result: 成功实施Vibe Coding不仅依赖代理能力，更需要系统性的上下文工程、完善的开发环境和人机协作开发模式。

Conclusion: Vibe Coding作为一种变革性开发方法，其成功实施需要理论框架和实践模型的系统性支持，而不仅仅是代理技术本身。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm
shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a
novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate
AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than
line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the
effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical
evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in
human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first
comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models,
establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this
transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over
1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining
critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding
agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We
first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a
Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic
relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents.
Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing
practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation,
Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and
Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in
this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding
depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering,
well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative
development models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旅游机构希望将易出错的定价任务自动化给AI系统，但在未经可靠性验证的情况下部署LLM可能导致重大财务损失和客户信任危机。

Method: 构建包含300个自然语言问题的基准数据集，基于42个真实定价政策，分为两个难度级别：基础客户类型定价和涉及交互折扣的捆绑旅游计算。

Result: 对一系列LLM的评估显示，在更难级别上性能急剧下降，暴露出规则解释和算术推理方面的系统性失败。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM具有通用能力，但在没有进一步保障措施或领域适应的情况下，当前LLM在收入关键应用中仍然不可靠。

Abstract: We present PricingLogic, the first benchmark that probes whether Large
Language Models(LLMs) can reliably automate tourism-related prices when
multiple, overlapping fare rules apply. Travel agencies are eager to offload
this error-prone task onto AI systems; however, deploying LLMs without verified
reliability could result in significant financial losses and erode customer
trust. PricingLogic comprises 300 natural-language questions based on booking
requests derived from 42 real-world pricing policies, spanning two levels of
difficulty: (i) basic customer-type pricing and (ii)bundled-tour calculations
involving interacting discounts. Evaluations of a line of LLMs reveal a steep
performance drop on the harder tier,exposing systematic failures in rule
interpretation and arithmetic reasoning.These results highlight that, despite
their general capabilities, today's LLMs remain unreliable in revenue-critical
applications without further safeguards or domain adaptation. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/PricingLogic.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTOS框架，将多主题环境与LLMs结合，通过短期和长期记忆、多种交互机制和动态主题选择策略，模拟多主题环境下的观点演化，显著改变群体极化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有研究主要关注单一主题，无法捕捉多主题、跨领域认知转移的问题，以及传统数值模型将复杂语言态度简化为离散值，缺乏可解释性和行为一致性的局限。

Method: MTOS框架整合LLMs与短期和长期记忆，采用多种用户选择交互机制和动态主题选择策略，并利用信念衰减机制实现跨主题观点更新。

Result: 多主题设置显著改变极化趋势：正相关主题放大回音室效应，负相关主题抑制回音室，无关主题通过资源竞争也减轻回音室效应。LLM代理能真实模拟动态观点变化，再现新闻文本语言特征，捕捉复杂人类推理。

Conclusion: MTOS框架提高了模拟的可解释性和系统稳定性，相比传统数值模型能更真实地模拟多主题环境下的观点演化过程。

Abstract: The polarization of opinions, information segregation, and cognitive biases
on social media have attracted significant academic attention. In real-world
networks, information often spans multiple interrelated topics, posing
challenges for opinion evolution and highlighting the need for frameworks that
simulate interactions among topics. Existing studies based on large language
models (LLMs) focus largely on single topics, limiting the capture of cognitive
transfer in multi-topic, cross-domain contexts. Traditional numerical models,
meanwhile, simplify complex linguistic attitudes into discrete values, lacking
interpretability, behavioral consistency, and the ability to integrate multiple
topics. To address these issues, we propose Multi-topic Opinion Simulation
(MTOS), a social simulation framework integrating multi-topic contexts with
LLMs. MTOS leverages LLMs alongside short-term and long-term memory,
incorporates multiple user-selection interaction mechanisms and dynamic
topic-selection strategies, and employs a belief decay mechanism to enable
perspective updates across topics. We conduct extensive experiments on MTOS,
varying topic numbers, correlation types, and performing ablation studies to
assess features such as group polarization and local consistency. Results show
that multi-topic settings significantly alter polarization trends: positively
correlated topics amplify echo chambers, negatively correlated topics inhibit
them, and irrelevant topics also mitigate echo chamber effects through resource
competition. Compared with numerical models, LLM-based agents realistically
simulate dynamic opinion changes, reproduce linguistic features of news texts,
and capture complex human reasoning, improving simulation interpretability and
system stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无信号交叉口的自动驾驶决策面临复杂动态交互和高冲突风险的挑战，需要实现主动安全控制。

Method: 基于Soft Actor-Critic算法，使用偏置注意力机制构建交通风险预测器，评估车辆进入交叉口的长期碰撞风险，并将风险转化为密集奖励信号。

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法有效提升了交叉口的交通效率和车辆安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂场景下证明了智能决策框架的有效性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving decision-making at unsignalized intersections is highly
challenging due to complex dynamic interactions and high conflict risks. To
achieve proactive safety control, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) decision-making framework integrated with a biased attention
mechanism. The framework is built upon the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm.
Its core innovation lies in the use of biased attention to construct a traffic
risk predictor. This predictor assesses the long-term risk of collision for a
vehicle entering the intersection and transforms this risk into a dense reward
signal to guide the SAC agent in making safe and efficient driving decisions.
Finally, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively improves both traffic efficiency and vehicle safety at the
intersection, thereby proving the effectiveness of the intelligent
decision-making framework in complex scenarios. The code of our work is
available at https://github.com/hank111525/SAC-RWB.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了LLM作为评判者时的偏见问题，发现现有模型对偏见输入具有鲁棒性，但微调于有偏见的高分数据会显著降低性能，并提出了四种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在通信系统中被用于自主评估内容质量，这些AI"评判者"的公正性无法保证，其评估标准中的偏见可能扭曲结果并损害用户信任。

Method: 在点式评分设置下系统调查了两种LLM评判模型（GPT-Judge和JudgeLM）中的11种偏见类型，涵盖隐式和显式形式，并分析了微调、评分标准、任务难度等因素的影响。

Result: 最先进的LLM评判者对偏见输入表现出鲁棒性，通常给它们分配比相应干净样本更低的分数；提供详细评分标准能进一步增强鲁棒性；在偏见的高分响应上微调LLM会显著降低其性能；评判分数与任务难度相关。

Conclusion: LLM评判者存在多种偏见风险，但通过适当措施（如详细评分标准）可以增强鲁棒性，需要谨慎处理训练数据和实施缓解策略以确保AI评判的公平可靠。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to autonomously
evaluate the quality of content in communication systems, e.g., to assess
responses in telecom customer support chatbots. However, the impartiality of
these AI "judges" is not guaranteed, and any biases in their evaluation
criteria could skew outcomes and undermine user trust. In this paper, we
systematically investigate judgment biases in two LLM-as-a-judge models (i.e.,
GPT-Judge and JudgeLM) under the point-wise scoring setting, encompassing 11
types of biases that cover both implicit and explicit forms. We observed that
state-of-the-art LLM judges demonstrate robustness to biased inputs, generally
assigning them lower scores than the corresponding clean samples. Providing a
detailed scoring rubric further enhances this robustness. We further found that
fine-tuning an LLM on high-scoring yet biased responses can significantly
degrade its performance, highlighting the risk of training on biased data. We
also discovered that the judged scores correlate with task difficulty: a
challenging dataset like GPQA yields lower average scores, whereas an
open-ended reasoning dataset (e.g., JudgeLM-val) sees higher average scores.
Finally, we proposed four potential mitigation strategies to ensure fair and
reliable AI judging in practical communication scenarios.

Motivation: 为医疗领域开发高效的对话系统，将医学算法和指南转化为结构化问题流程，减少认知负担并支持临床工作流程。

Method: 采用有向无环图结构，包含问题转换管道、基于层次聚类的冷启动机制、扩展剪枝的自适应分支、终止逻辑以及自动化报告生成。

Result: 患者应用：低认知负荷(15.6)、高可用性(86)、强满意度(8.1/9)；医生应用：中等认知负荷(26)、优秀可用性(88.5)、高满意度(8.3/9)。

Conclusion: 该系统有效集成到临床工作流程中，减少了认知需求并支持高效报告生成，但存在系统延迟和小样本评估的局限性。

Abstract: We developed a task-oriented dialogue framework structured as a Directed
Acyclic Graph (DAG) of medical questions. The system integrates: (1) a
systematic pipeline for transforming medical algorithms and guidelines into a
clinical question corpus; (2) a cold-start mechanism based on hierarchical
clustering to generate efficient initial questioning without prior patient
information; (3) an expand-and-prune mechanism enabling adaptive branching and
backtracking based on patient responses; (4) a termination logic to ensure
interviews end once sufficient information is gathered; and (5) automated
synthesis of doctor-friendly structured reports aligned with clinical
workflows. Human-computer interaction principles guided the design of both the
patient and physician applications. Preliminary evaluation involved five
physicians using standardized instruments: NASA-TLX (cognitive workload), the
System Usability Scale (SUS), and the Questionnaire for User Interface
Satisfaction (QUIS). The patient application achieved low workload scores
(NASA-TLX = 15.6), high usability (SUS = 86), and strong satisfaction (QUIS =
8.1/9), with particularly high ratings for ease of learning and interface
design. The physician application yielded moderate workload (NASA-TLX = 26) and
excellent usability (SUS = 88.5), with satisfaction scores of 8.3/9. Both
applications demonstrated effective integration into clinical workflows,
reducing cognitive demand and supporting efficient report generation.
Limitations included occasional system latency and a small, non-diverse
evaluation sample.

Result: 构建了决策对齐的评估蓝图，涵盖模态、尺度、情境和干预四个维度。推荐操作符感知的数据设计、抗泄漏分区以及透明的校准和报告方法。

Conclusion: CSL视角和操作符语法框架能够促进可重复的、同类比较，通过系统化的评估方法和数据设计原则，提升AI虚拟细胞模型在真实世界应用中的可靠性和实用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence Virtual Cells (AIVCs) aim to learn executable,
decision-relevant models of cell state from multimodal, multiscale
measurements. Recent studies have introduced single-cell and spatial foundation
models, improved cross-modality alignment, scaled perturbation atlases, and
explored pathway-level readouts. Nevertheless, although held-out validation is
standard practice, evaluations remain predominantly within single datasets and
settings; evidence indicates that transport across laboratories and platforms
is often limited, that some data splits are vulnerable to leakage and coverage
bias, and that dose, time and combination effects are not yet systematically
handled. Cross-scale coupling also remains constrained, as anchors linking
molecular, cellular and tissue levels are sparse, and alignment to scientific
or clinical readouts varies across studies. We propose a model-agnostic
Cell-State Latent (CSL) perspective that organizes learning via an operator
grammar: measurement, lift/project for cross-scale coupling, and intervention
for dosing and scheduling. This view motivates a decision-aligned evaluation
blueprint across modality, scale, context and intervention, and emphasizes
function-space readouts such as pathway activity, spatial neighborhoods and
clinically relevant endpoints. We recommend operator-aware data design,
leakage-resistant partitions, and transparent calibration and reporting to
enable reproducible, like-for-like comparisons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于原型的模型通常在粗粒度（句子或文档级别）运行，无法处理现实世界文本分类的多标签性质，需要细粒度可解释模型。

Method: 采用双阶段交替训练策略：无监督原型发现阶段学习语义连贯且多样化的原型，监督分类阶段将这些原型映射到类别标签。使用分层损失函数确保子句、句子和文档级别的一致性。

Result: 在酒店评论基准数据集和两个公共基准测试（二分类和多分类）上，ProtoSiTex实现了最先进的性能，并提供忠实、与人类对齐的解释。

Conclusion: ProtoSiTex是多标签文本分类的强大半可解释解决方案，能够捕获重叠和冲突语义，同时保持高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: The surge in user-generated reviews has amplified the need for interpretable
models that can provide fine-grained insights. Existing prototype-based models
offer intuitive explanations but typically operate at coarse granularity
(sentence or document level) and fail to address the multi-label nature of
real-world text classification. We propose ProtoSiTex, a semi-interpretable
framework designed for fine-grained multi-label text classification. ProtoSiTex
employs a dual-phase alternating training strategy: an unsupervised prototype
discovery phase that learns semantically coherent and diverse prototypes, and a
supervised classification phase that maps these prototypes to class labels. A
hierarchical loss function enforces consistency across sub-sentence, sentence,
and document levels, enhancing interpretability and alignment. Unlike prior
approaches, ProtoSiTex captures overlapping and conflicting semantics using
adaptive prototypes and multi-head attention. We also introduce a benchmark
dataset of hotel reviews annotated at the sub-sentence level with multiple
labels. Experiments on this dataset and two public benchmarks (binary and
multi-class) show that ProtoSiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance while
delivering faithful, human-aligned explanations, establishing it as a robust
solution for semi-interpretable multi-label text classification.

Abstract: The competitive and cooperative forces of natural selection have driven the
evolution of intelligence for millions of years, culminating in nature's vast
biodiversity and the complexity of human minds. Inspired by this process, we
propose a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework where each agent
is assigned a genotype and where reward functions are modelled after the
concept of inclusive fitness. An agent's genetic material may be shared with
other agents, and our inclusive reward function naturally accounts for this. We
study the resulting social dynamics in two types of network games with
prisoner's dilemmas and find that our results align with well-established
principles from biology, such as Hamilton's rule. Furthermore, we outline how
this framework can extend to more open-ended environments with spatial and
temporal structure, finite resources, and evolving populations. We hypothesize
the emergence of an arms race of strategies, where each new strategy is a
gradual improvement over earlier adaptations of other agents, effectively
producing a multi-agent autocurriculum analogous to biological evolution. In
contrast to the binary team-based structures prevalent in earlier research, our
gene-based reward structure introduces a spectrum of cooperation ranging from
full adversity to full cooperativeness based on genetic similarity, enabling
unique non team-based social dynamics. For example, one agent having a mutual
cooperative relationship with two other agents, while the two other agents
behave adversarially towards each other. We argue that incorporating inclusive
fitness in agents provides a foundation for the emergence of more strategically
advanced and socially intelligent agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HardcoreLogic基准测试，包含5000多个谜题，通过增加复杂性、非常规元素和不可解谜题三个维度来测试大型推理模型的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型对记忆化模式的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注9x9数独等流行谜题，存在过拟合规范格式和记忆解模式的风险，无法评估模型对新颖规则的理解和策略适应能力。

Method: 通过三个维度系统化转换规范谜题：增加复杂性(IC)、非常规元素(UE)和不可解谜题(UP)，构建包含10种游戏的5000多个谜题的挑战性基准。

Result: 评估显示即使在其他基准上表现优异的模型也出现显著性能下降，表明严重依赖记忆化刻板印象。增加复杂性是主要困难来源，但模型在细微规则变化上也表现不佳。

Conclusion: HardcoreLogic揭示了当前大型推理模型的局限性，为推进高级逻辑推理建立了基准测试标准。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
complex tasks, including logical puzzle games that require deriving solutions
satisfying all constraints. However, whether they can flexibly apply
appropriate rules to varying conditions, particularly when faced with
non-canonical game variants, remains an open question. Existing corpora focus
on popular puzzles like 9x9 Sudoku, risking overfitting to canonical formats
and memorization of solution patterns, which can mask deficiencies in
understanding novel rules or adapting strategies to new variants. To address
this, we introduce HardcoreLogic, a challenging benchmark of over 5,000 puzzles
across 10 games, designed to test the robustness of LRMs on the "long-tail" of
logical games. HardcoreLogic systematically transforms canonical puzzles
through three dimensions: Increased Complexity (IC), Uncommon Elements (UE),
and Unsolvable Puzzles (UP), reducing reliance on shortcut memorization.
Evaluations on a diverse set of LRMs reveal significant performance drops, even
for models achieving top scores on existing benchmarks, indicating heavy
reliance on memorized stereotypes. While increased complexity is the dominant
source of difficulty, models also struggle with subtle rule variations that do
not necessarily increase puzzle difficulty. Our systematic error analysis on
solvable and unsolvable puzzles further highlights gaps in genuine reasoning.
Overall, HardcoreLogic exposes the limitations of current LRMs and establishes
a benchmark for advancing high-level logical reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了Memory-as-Action框架，将工作记忆管理重构为可学习的内在能力，通过强化学习联合优化任务推理和内存管理，解决了LLM在长视野任务中的内存限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长视野代理任务中面临内存限制，现有工作记忆方法依赖与核心策略解耦的外部启发式机制，需要更紧密集成的解决方案。

Method: 提出Memory-as-Action框架，将内存管理作为统一策略中的显式编辑操作；开发Dynamic Context Policy Optimization算法，通过轨迹分段解决内存编辑导致的轨迹断裂问题。

Result: 端到端联合优化不仅减少了计算消耗，还提高了任务性能，模型能够根据内在能力自适应地调整上下文管理策略。

Conclusion: 将工作记忆管理作为可学习的内在能力，通过统一策略框架实现任务推理和内存管理的联合优化，是解决LLM长视野任务内存限制的有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models face challenges in long-horizon agentic tasks as their
constrained memory is easily overwhelmed by distracting or irrelevant context.
Existing working memory methods typically rely on external, heuristic
mechanisms that are decoupled from the agent's core policy. In this work, we
reframe working memory management as a learnable, intrinsic capability. We
propose a novel framework, Memory-as-Action, where an agent actively manages
its working memory by executing explicit editing operations as part of a
unified policy. This formulation allows an agent, trained via reinforcement
learning, to balance memory curation against long-term task objectives under
given resource constraints. However, such memory editing actions break the
standard assumption of a continuously growing prefix in LLM interactions,
leading to what we call trajectory fractures. These non-prefix changes disrupt
the causal continuity required by standard policy gradient methods, making
those methods inapplicable. To address this, we propose a new algorithm,
Dynamic Context Policy Optimization, which enables stable end-to-end
reinforcement learning by segmenting trajectories at memory action points and
applying trajectory-level advantages to the resulting action segments. Our
results demonstrate that jointly optimizing for task reasoning and memory
management in an end-to-end fashion not only reduces overall computational
consumption but also improves task performance, driven by adaptive context
curation strategies tailored to the model's intrinsic capabilities.

Motivation: 解决高性能具身AI系统依赖昂贵大型模型，而小型模型缺乏必要知识和技能的问题。

Method: 第一阶段进行具身先验学习，从轨迹增强先验、环境锚定先验和外部知识先验中提取知识；第二阶段开发在线强化学习管道，包含自总结、密集奖励塑造和回合级策略优化。

Result: ERA-3B在EB-ALFRED任务上比GPT-4o提升8.4%，在EB-Manipulation任务上提升19.4%，并在未见任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: ERA为可扩展的具身智能提供了实用路径，为未来具身AI系统提供了方法论见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in embodied AI highlight the potential of vision language
models (VLMs) as agents capable of perception, reasoning, and interaction in
complex environments. However, top-performing systems rely on large-scale
models that are costly to deploy, while smaller VLMs lack the necessary
knowledge and skills to succeed. To bridge this gap, we present
\textit{Embodied Reasoning Agent (ERA)}, a two-stage framework that integrates
prior knowledge learning and online reinforcement learning (RL). The first
stage, \textit{Embodied Prior Learning}, distills foundational knowledge from
three types of data: (1) Trajectory-Augmented Priors, which enrich existing
trajectory data with structured reasoning generated by stronger models; (2)
Environment-Anchored Priors, which provide in-environment knowledge and
grounding supervision; and (3) External Knowledge Priors, which transfer
general knowledge from out-of-environment datasets. In the second stage, we
develop an online RL pipeline that builds on these priors to further enhance
agent performance. To overcome the inherent challenges in agent RL, including
long horizons, sparse rewards, and training instability, we introduce three key
designs: self-summarization for context management, dense reward shaping, and
turn-level policy optimization. Extensive experiments on both high-level
planning (EB-ALFRED) and low-level control (EB-Manipulation) tasks demonstrate
that ERA-3B surpasses both prompting-based large models and previous
training-based baselines. Specifically, it achieves overall improvements of
8.4\% on EB-ALFRED and 19.4\% on EB-Manipulation over GPT-4o, and exhibits
strong generalization to unseen tasks. Overall, ERA offers a practical path
toward scalable embodied intelligence, providing methodological insights for
future embodied AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM作为法官的方法依赖简单聚合（如多数投票），即使个体智能体给出正确答案也可能失败，需要更有效的协作判断方法

Method: 多智能体辩论框架，数学形式化辩论过程，引入基于时变Beta-Binomial混合模型的稳定性检测机制，使用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验进行自适应停止

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型上的实验表明，该框架相比多数投票提高了判断准确性，同时保持了计算效率

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论框架能有效提升LLM判断任务的准确性和效率，为自动化评估提供了更可靠的方法

Abstract: With advancements in reasoning capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are
increasingly employed for automated judgment tasks. While LLMs-as-Judges offer
promise in automating evaluations, current approaches often rely on simplistic
aggregation methods (e.g., majority voting), which can fail even when
individual agents provide correct answers. To address this, we propose a
multi-agent debate judge framework where agents collaboratively reason and
iteratively refine their responses. We formalize the debate process
mathematically, analyzing agent interactions and proving that debate amplifies
correctness compared to static ensembles. To enhance efficiency, we introduce a
stability detection mechanism that models judge consensus dynamics via a
time-varying Beta-Binomial mixture, with adaptive stopping based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This mechanism models the
judges' collective correct rate dynamics using a time-varying mixture of
Beta-Binomial distributions and employs an adaptive stopping criterion based on
distributional similarity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic). Experiments across
multiple benchmarks and models demonstrate that our framework improves judgment
accuracy over majority voting while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 自动驾驶面临安全挑战，现有传感器存在视野受限和遮挡问题，车辆间通信可以通过共享信息来增强环境感知能力，特别是当传感器被遮挡时。

Method: 设计并训练了基于图神经网络的CAMNet模型，使用协作感知消息数据，在一个广泛使用的运动预测数据集上进行训练，并在自建的CAM数据集上进行评估。

Conclusion: 协作感知消息能够有效用于车辆轨迹预测，为自动驾驶提供了新的数据源，但该方法仍存在改进空间，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Autonomous driving remains a challenging task, particularly due to safety
concerns. Modern vehicles are typically equipped with expensive sensors such as
LiDAR, cameras, and radars to reduce the risk of accidents. However, these
sensors face inherent limitations: their field of view and line of sight can be
obstructed by other vehicles, thereby reducing situational awareness. In this
context, vehicle-to-vehicle communication plays a crucial role, as it enables
cars to share information and remain aware of each other even when sensors are
occluded. One way to achieve this is through the use of Cooperative Awareness
Messages (CAMs). In this paper, we investigate the use of CAM data for vehicle
trajectory prediction. Specifically, we design and train a neural network,
Cooperative Awareness Message-based Graph Neural Network (CAMNet), on a widely
used motion forecasting dataset. We then evaluate the model on a second dataset
that we created from scratch using Cooperative Awareness Messages, in order to
assess whether this type of data can be effectively exploited. Our approach
demonstrates promising results, showing that CAMs can indeed support vehicle
trajectory prediction. At the same time, we discuss several limitations of the
approach, which highlight opportunities for future research.

Method: 结合自监督学习原理和图论技术，从无标记数据中学习有用表示，从而更有效地识别和分类OOD样本。

Result: 与现有最先进方法相比，该方法在AUROC指标上达到了0.99的优异性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功提高了AI系统在无需标记数据情况下的OOD检测能力，增强了系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robustness in AI systems refers to their ability to maintain reliable and
accurate performance under various conditions, including out-of-distribution
(OOD) samples, adversarial attacks, and environmental changes. This is crucial
in safety-critical systems, such as autonomous vehicles, transportation, or
healthcare, where malfunctions could have severe consequences. This paper
proposes an approach to improve OOD detection without the need of labeled data,
thereby increasing the AI systems' robustness. The proposed approach leverages
the principles of self-supervised learning, allowing the model to learn useful
representations from unlabeled data. Combined with graph-theoretical
techniques, this enables the more efficient identification and categorization
of OOD samples. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, this approach
achieved an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) =
0.99.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有JavaScript模糊测试方法使用随机选择来确定突变位置，作者认为选择更好的突变目标适合使用具有可变臂数的组合老虎机方法。

Method: 提出CLUTCH深度组合老虎机，能够观察可变长度的JavaScript测试用例表示，使用深度学习中的注意力机制，并通过Concrete Dropout动态调整探索策略。

Result: CLUTCH相比三种最先进解决方案，平均提高了20.3%的有效测试用例数量和8.9%的每测试用例覆盖率；在波动和组合设置中，分别实现了至少78.1%和4.1%更低的遗憾值。

Conclusion: CLUTCH在JavaScript模糊测试中显著提高了效率，在波动和组合环境中优于现有最先进的老虎机方法。

Abstract: JavaScript engines are widely used in web browsers, PDF readers, and
server-side applications. The rise in concern over their security has led to
the development of several targeted fuzzing techniques. However, existing
approaches use random selection to determine where to perform mutations in
JavaScript code. We postulate that the problem of selecting better mutation
targets is suitable for combinatorial bandits with a volatile number of arms.
Thus, we propose CLUTCH, a novel deep combinatorial bandit that can observe
variable length JavaScript test case representations, using an attention
mechanism from deep learning. Furthermore, using Concrete Dropout, CLUTCH can
dynamically adapt its exploration. We show that CLUTCH increases efficiency in
JavaScript fuzzing compared to three state-of-the-art solutions by increasing
the number of valid test cases and coverage-per-testcase by, respectively,
20.3% and 8.9% on average. In volatile and combinatorial settings we show that
CLUTCH outperforms state-of-the-art bandits, achieving at least 78.1% and 4.1%
less regret in volatile and combinatorial settings, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户对推荐系统不满意时，他们通常缺乏细粒度控制来改变推荐结果。大语言模型提供了解决方案，允许用户通过自然语言请求来指导推荐。

Method: 在训练阶段，使用LLM模拟用户是否基于语言请求批准项目，训练嵌入模型来近似这些模拟判断。然后将基于用户请求的预测集成到传统推荐系统优化的标准信号加权中。部署时，每个用户请求仅需一次LLM嵌入计算。

Result: 在MovieLens数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种请求上都能实现细粒度控制。在19名Letterboxd用户的研究中，CTRL-Rec受到用户积极评价，与传统控制相比显著增强了用户的控制感和满意度。

Conclusion: CTRL-Rec方法能够有效实现自然语言对推荐系统的实时控制，提升用户体验和满意度。

Abstract: When users are dissatisfied with recommendations from a recommender system,
they often lack fine-grained controls for changing them. Large language models
(LLMs) offer a solution by allowing users to guide their recommendations
through natural language requests (e.g., "I want to see respectful posts with a
different perspective than mine"). We propose a method, CTRL-Rec, that allows
for natural language control of traditional recommender systems in real-time
with computational efficiency. Specifically, at training time, we use an LLM to
simulate whether users would approve of items based on their language requests,
and we train embedding models that approximate such simulated judgments. We
then integrate these user-request-based predictions into the standard weighting
of signals that traditional recommender systems optimize. At deployment time,
we require only a single LLM embedding computation per user request, allowing
for real-time control of recommendations. In experiments with the MovieLens
dataset, our method consistently allows for fine-grained control across a
diversity of requests. In a study with 19 Letterboxd users, we find that
CTRL-Rec was positively received by users and significantly enhanced users'
sense of control and satisfaction with recommendations compared to traditional
controls.

Abstract: We present Ax-Prover, a multi-agent system for automated theorem proving in
Lean that can solve problems across diverse scientific domains and operate
either autonomously or collaboratively with human experts. To achieve this,
Ax-Prover approaches scientific problem solving through formal proof
generation, a process that demands both creative reasoning and strict syntactic
rigor. Ax-Prover meets this challenge by equipping Large Language Models
(LLMs), which provide knowledge and reasoning, with Lean tools via the Model
Context Protocol (MCP), which ensure formal correctness. To evaluate its
performance as an autonomous prover, we benchmark our approach against frontier
LLMs and specialized prover models on two public math benchmarks and on two
Lean benchmarks we introduce in the fields of abstract algebra and quantum
theory. On public datasets, Ax-Prover is competitive with state-of-the-art
provers, while it largely outperform them on the new benchmarks. This shows
that, unlike specialized systems that struggle to generalize, our tool-based
agentic theorem prover approach offers a generalizable methodology for formal
verification across diverse scientific domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate
Ax-Prover's assistant capabilities in a practical use case, showing how it
enabled an expert mathematician to formalize the proof of a complex
cryptography theorem.

Motivation: 随着沉浸式3D内容需求的增长，当前VR中物理操纵3D内容的技术存在显著限制，包括依赖工程密集型过程和简化的几何表示（如四面体笼），这会损害视觉保真度和物理准确性。

Method: 将物体的网格与高斯泼溅(GS)表示直接集成，利用现有的3D网格资产，实现无缝内容重用和简化开发流程。系统设计为物理引擎无关，提供强大的部署灵活性。

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式3D操作提供了一种高度真实、适应性强且直观的方法，显示出作为现有方法可行替代方案的潜力。

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Motivation: 现有方法如JGS2使用扰动子空间增强局部求解以考虑全局耦合，但会引入阻尼从而降低收敛速度。

Method: 重用子空间但独立求解局部和子空间位移，消除阻尼效应，在子空间能充分捕捉全局耦合时实现接近牛顿法的收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持坐标下降效率和并行性的同时实现快速收敛，并分析了子空间坐标方法成功或失败的条件，为未来求解器设计提供见解。

Abstract: We introduce Coordinate Condensation, a variant of coordinate descent that
accelerates physics-based simulation by augmenting local coordinate updates
with a Schur-complement-based subspace correction. Recent work by Lan et al.
2025 (JGS2) uses perturbation subspaces to augment local solves to account for
global coupling, but their approach introduces damping that can degrade
convergence. We reuse this subspace but solve for local and subspace
displacements independently, eliminating this damping. For problems where the
subspace adequately captures global coupling, our method achieves near-Newton
convergence while retaining the efficiency and parallelism of coordinate
descent. Through experiments across varying material stiffnesses and mesh
resolutions, we show substantially faster convergence than both standard
coordinate descent and JGS2. We also characterize when subspace-based
coordinate methods succeed or fail, offering insights for future solver design.

Result: 在零样本和少样本场景下相比现有方法取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 表示间隙是保持模态特定知识和提升迁移性能的几何必要性，过度对齐会导致结构坍塌，损害拓扑推理和语义理解能力。

Abstract: Representation learning on text-attributed graphs (TAGs) integrates
structural connectivity with rich textual semantics, enabling applications in
diverse domains. Current methods largely rely on contrastive learning to
maximize cross-modal similarity, assuming tighter coupling between graph and
text representations improves transfer performance. However, our empirical
analysis reveals that both natural gap expansion and forced gap reduction
result in performance degradation by disrupting pre-trained knowledge
structures and impairing generalization. This arises from the geometric
incompatibility between encoders, where graph encoders capture topological
patterns, while text encoders capture semantic structures. Over-alignment
compresses these distinct spaces into shared subspaces, causing structure
collapse that diminishes both topological reasoning and semantic understanding.
We propose \textbf{LLM4GTA}, a gap-aware alignment framework that preserves
representation gaps as geometric necessities for maintaining modality-specific
knowledge and improving transfer performance. LLM4GTA includes an adaptive gap
preservation module to prevent over-alignment by monitoring similarity
evolution and an intra-modal compensation mechanism that boosts discriminative
power using auxiliary classifiers in graph space. Extensive experiments show
significant improvements over existing methods in zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios.

methods, the central objective is to fully exploit the effective information
embedded in sketches. However, there is limited research on what constitutes
effective sketch information, which in turn constrains the performance of
existing approaches. To tackle this issue, we first proposed the Multi-Level
Sketch Representation Scheme to systematically identify the effective
information. The scheme organizes sketch representation into three levels:
sketch-level, stroke-level, and point-level. This design is based on the
granularity of analytical elements, from coarse (sketch-level) to fine
(point-level), thereby ensuring more comprehensive coverage of the sketch
information. For each level, we conducted theoretical analyses and experimental
evaluations to identify and validate the effective information. Building on the
above studies, we developed SDGraph, a deep learning architecture designed to
exploit the identified effective information across the three levels. SDGraph
comprises two complementary modules: a Sparse Graph that treats strokes as
nodes for sketch-level and stroke-level representation learning, and a Dense
Graph that treats points as nodes for sketch-level and point-level
representation learning. Both modules employ graph convolution along with
down-sampling and up-sampling operations, enabling them to function as both
encoder and decoder. Besides that, an information fusion module bridges the two
graphs to further enhance feature extraction. SDGraph supports a wide range of
sketch-related downstream tasks, achieving accuracy improvements of 1.15\% and
1.70\% over the state-of-the-art in classification and retrieval, respectively,
and 36.58\% improvement in vector sketch generation quality.
