Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTM是一个无需训练、即插即用的视频生成框架，通过粗参考动画实现精确的运动控制，同时保持外观保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像和文本的视频生成方法无法提供精确的运动控制，而需要模型特定微调的方法计算成本高且限制性强。

Method: 使用用户友好的操作（如剪切拖拽或基于深度的重投影）获取粗参考动画作为运动线索，采用双时钟去噪策略在运动指定区域强制强对齐，同时允许其他区域的灵活性。

Result: 在物体和相机运动基准测试中，TTM在真实性和运动控制方面匹配或超越了现有的基于训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: TTM提供了一种轻量级的采样过程修改，无需额外训练或运行时成本，兼容任何骨干网络，并引入了通过像素级条件实现的精确外观控制能力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based video generation can create realistic videos, yet existing image- and text-based conditioning fails to offer precise motion control. Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

### [2] [OUGS: Active View Selection via Object-aware Uncertainty Estimation in 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09397)
*Haiyi Li,Qi Chen,Denis Kalkofen,Hsiang-Ting Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了OUGS框架，通过基于3D高斯原语物理参数的显式不确定性建模，结合语义分割实现对象感知的主动重建，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅在目标对象重建中的效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动重建方法依赖场景级不确定性度量，容易受到无关背景干扰，导致在对象中心任务中的视图选择效率低下。需要一种更原则性的方法来专门提升目标对象的重建质量。

Method: 从3D高斯原语的物理参数（位置、尺度、旋转）推导不确定性，通过渲染雅可比矩阵传播协方差，建立可解释的不确定性模型。结合语义分割掩码生成对象感知的不确定性评分，实现针对性的主动视图选择。

Result: 在公共数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了3DGS重建过程的效率，相比现有最先进方法在目标对象上实现了更高质量的重建，同时也能作为全局场景的鲁棒不确定性估计器。

Conclusion: OUGS框架通过物理基础的不确定性建模和对象感知的视图选择，有效解决了复杂场景中特定对象高效重建的挑战，为3D高斯泼溅在对象中心任务中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved state-of-the-art results for novel view synthesis. However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.

Abstract: The energy transition is a key theme of the last decades to determine a future of eco-sustainability, and an area of such importance cannot disregard digitization, innovation and the new technological tools available. This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization. An accuracy of 91\% has been achieved in the extraction of textual information relating to design data. Regarding the plants topology, 93\% of components are correctly identified and the hierarchical structure is extracted with an accuracy around 80\%.

### [4] [Assessing Identity Leakage in Talking Face Generation: Metrics and Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08613)
*Dogucan Yaman,Fevziye Irem Eyiokur,Hazım Kemal Ekenel,Alexander Waibel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出系统评估方法分析唇部泄漏问题，通过三种测试设置和衍生指标量化唇同步性能，为说话人脸生成建立可靠基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于修复的说话人脸生成方法在保持说话者一致性的同时，可能引入唇部泄漏问题，即生成的唇形受到参考图像影响而非仅由驱动音频决定，这种泄漏难以通过标准指标检测。

Method: 提出系统评估框架，采用三种互补测试设置：静音输入生成、不匹配音视频配对和匹配音视频合成，并引入唇同步差异和基于静音音频的唇同步评分等衍生指标。

Result: 该方法能够有效分析和量化唇部泄漏问题，并研究不同身份参考选择对泄漏的影响，为参考设计提供见解。

Conclusion: 提出的评估方法是模型无关的，为未来说话人脸生成研究建立了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Inpainting-based talking face generation aims to preserve video details such as pose, lighting, and gestures while modifying only lip motion, often using an identity reference image to maintain speaker consistency. However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores. In addition, we study how different identity reference selections affect leakage, providing insights into reference design. The proposed methodology is model-agnostic and establishes a more reliable benchmark for future research in talking face generation.

### [5] [A Multi-Drone Multi-View Dataset and Deep Learning Framework for Pedestrian Detection and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08615)
*Kosta Dakic,Kanchana Thilakarathna,Rodrigo N. Calheiros,Teng Joon Lim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MATRIX数据集和深度学习框架，用于解决多无人机动态监控中行人跟踪的挑战，在复杂遮挡环境下保持约90%的检测跟踪准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理动态相机位置和复杂遮挡，需要新的数据集和框架来推进多视角监控系统发展。

Method: 使用8架无人机同步拍摄，结合实时相机标定、特征图像配准和多视角特征融合到鸟瞰图表示。

Result: 在复杂环境下保持约90%检测跟踪准确率，成功跟踪约80%轨迹，迁移学习和相机失效实验显示良好泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MATRIX数据集和框架为动态多视角监控系统提供了重要基准，在复杂环境下表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-drone surveillance systems offer enhanced coverage and robustness for pedestrian tracking, yet existing approaches struggle with dynamic camera positions and complex occlusions. This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\sim$90\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\sim$80\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.

*Xuan Yu,Tianyang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Grassmannian流形的拓扑驱动多子空间融合框架，通过动态子空间协作来增强几何表示学习能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态单子空间表示，忽略了多个子空间之间的动态交互对捕捉复杂几何结构的重要性

Method: 1) 基于Kolmogorov-Arnold表示定理的自适应多子空间建模机制；2) 通过Fréchet均值优化在流形上融合异构几何表示的多子空间交互块

Result: 在3D动作识别、EEG分类和图任务上的广泛实验证明了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了几何深度学习，还成功将欧几里得网络中经过验证的多通道交互原理适应到非欧几里得领域，实现了优越的判别性和可解释性

Abstract: Grassmannian manifold offers a powerful carrier for geometric representation learning by modelling high-dimensional data as low-dimensional subspaces. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on static single-subspace representations, neglecting the dynamic interplay between multiple subspaces critical for capturing complex geometric structures. To address this limitation, we propose a topology-driven multi-subspace fusion framework that enables adaptive subspace collaboration on the Grassmannian. Our solution introduces two key innovations: (1) Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, an adaptive multi-subspace modelling mechanism is proposed that dynamically selects and weights task-relevant subspaces via topological convergence analysis, and (2) a multi-subspace interaction block that fuses heterogeneous geometric representations through Fréchet mean optimisation on the manifold. Theoretically, we establish the convergence guarantees of adaptive subspaces under a projection metric topology, ensuring stable gradient-based optimisation. Practically, we integrate Riemannian batch normalisation and mutual information regularisation to enhance discriminability and robustness. Extensive experiments on 3D action recognition (HDM05, FPHA), EEG classification (MAMEM-SSVEPII), and graph tasks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work not only advances geometric deep learning but also successfully adapts the proven multi-channel interaction philosophy of Euclidean networks to non-Euclidean domains, achieving superior discriminability and interpretability.

### [7] [CADIC: Continual Anomaly Detection Based on Incremental Coreset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08634)
*Gen Yang,Zhipeng Deng,Junfeng Man*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续异常检测框架，使用统一内存库而非任务特定内存库，通过固定大小的核心集增量更新嵌入，在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于嵌入的持续异常检测方法需要为每个任务构建特定类别子内存库的问题，这限制了方法的灵活性和可扩展性。

Method: 所有任务共享统一内存库，在固定大小核心集中增量更新嵌入，通过最近邻匹配机制计算异常分数。

Result: 在MVTec AD和Visa数据集上分别达到0.972和0.891的平均图像级AUROC分数，在真实电子纸数据集上实现100%异常样本检测准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持检测精度的同时提高了持续异常检测的灵活性和可扩展性，在真实场景中表现出强大鲁棒性。

Abstract: The primary objective of Continual Anomaly Detection (CAD) is to learn the normal patterns of new tasks under dynamic data distribution assumptions while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios. The implementation will be open-sourced on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一框架，结合扩散去噪和时间感知的actor-critic模型，用于自动驾驶中的事故预测，在传感器退化和噪声条件下实现早期可靠预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶事故预测中的两个关键挑战：传感器输入噪声/退化问题，以及平衡早期预警与误报抑制的时机选择问题。

Method: 使用扩散模块通过迭代细化重建抗噪声的图像和物体特征，同时采用actor-critic架构进行长期时间推理和时间加权奖励，确定最佳预警时机。

Result: 在三个基准数据集(DAD、CCD、A3D)上达到最先进精度，显著提高平均事故时间，在高斯和脉冲噪声下保持鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: 该模型在常规和复杂交通场景中产生更早、更稳定且与人类判断一致的预测，具有实际安全关键部署的潜力。

Abstract: Accident anticipation is essential for proactive and safe autonomous driving, where even a brief advance warning can enable critical evasive actions. However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.

### [9] [RS-Net: Context-Aware Relation Scoring for Dynamic Scene Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08651)
*Hae-Won Jo,Yeong-Jun Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了关系评分网络（RS-Net），通过空间上下文编码器和时间编码器对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，可轻松集成到现有动态场景图生成模型中，显著提升召回率和精确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态场景图生成方法仅在有标注的物体对上训练，缺乏对非相关物体对的指导，导致在推理时难以识别有意义的关系。

Method: RS-Net包含空间上下文编码器（含可学习上下文标记）和时间编码器，通过空间交互和长程时间上下文对物体对的关系重要性进行评分，并将评分集成到统一的三元组评分机制中。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上的实验表明，RS-Net在各种基线模型上一致提升了召回率和精确率，特别是在平均召回率上有显著提升，有效解决了关系长尾分布问题。

Conclusion: RS-Net是一个模块化框架，无需改变现有模型架构即可集成，在保持竞争性效率的同时实现了优于最先进方法的性能。

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graph Generation (DSGG) models how object relations evolve over time in videos. However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

### [10] [Privacy Beyond Pixels: Latent Anonymization for Privacy-Preserving Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08666)
*Joseph Fioresi,Ishan Rajendrakumar Dave,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在潜在空间中保护视频基础模型视觉隐私的新方法，通过轻量级的匿名化适配器模块从视频特征中移除私人信息，同时保持通用任务效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型提取的时空特征在分享或存储时会无意中泄露敏感个人信息（如肤色、性别、服装），而现有的像素级匿名化方法需要重新训练整个模型且仅适用于特定任务。

Method: 设计轻量级匿名化适配器模块（AAM），采用三种训练目标：片段级自监督隐私目标、协同训练目标和潜在一致性损失，可在冻结的视频编码器上即插即用。

Result: 在多个下游任务（动作识别、时序动作检测、异常检测）中，隐私泄露显著减少35%，同时保持接近基线的效用性能，并能有效缓解动作识别模型中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法为视频基础模型提供了一种高效、通用的隐私保护解决方案，既保护了个人隐私又保持了模型性能，促进了更公平的视频理解。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation of visual privacy preservation for video foundation models that operates entirely in the latent space. While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.

TL;DR: 本文研究了自回归逐像素预测的缩放特性，发现不同任务的最优缩放策略存在显著差异，且计算资源是主要瓶颈而非训练数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归逐像素预测这一简单但未被充分研究的统一视觉模型框架的缩放特性，了解其在图像分类和生成任务中的表现规律。

Method: 使用IsoFlops配置文件，在32x32分辨率下训练一系列Transformer模型，计算预算高达7e19 FLOPs，评估三个目标指标：逐像素预测目标、ImageNet分类准确率和生成质量。

Result: 发现图像分类和图像生成的最优缩放策略存在分歧，生成任务需要数据规模比分类任务快3-5倍增长；随着分辨率提高，模型规模必须比数据规模增长更快；计算资源是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 基于计算资源每年增长4-5倍的预测，逐像素图像建模在未来五年内是可行的。

Abstract: This paper investigates the scaling properties of autoregressive next-pixel prediction, a simple, end-to-end yet under-explored framework for unified vision models. Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分类系统常因训练数据中群体代表性不均而继承偏见，例如人脸数据集中金发与女性的过度关联会强化刻板印象。现有方法使用Stable Diffusion生成平衡数据但难以保持原始数据分布。

Method: 探索多种扩散模型微调技术（LoRA和DreamBooth），通过聚类每个组内的图像并为每个聚类训练单独的DreamBooth模型，防止模型被组内过度变化淹没。使用这些模型生成群体平衡数据进行预训练，然后在真实数据上微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，研究的微调方法平均优于原始Stable Diffusion，与最先进的去偏技术（如Group-DRO）结果相当，且随着数据集偏见严重程度的增加而超越这些方法。

Conclusion: 扩散模型微调技术能有效生成更准确的平衡训练数据，缓解数据偏见问题，特别是在偏见严重的数据集上表现优于现有去偏方法。

Abstract: Image classification systems often inherit biases from uneven group representation in training data. For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.

Abstract: Graph convolutional network (GCN)-based methods have shown strong performance in 3D human pose estimation by leveraging the natural graph structure of the human skeleton. However, their local receptive field limits their ability to capture long-range dependencies essential for handling occlusions and depth ambiguities. They also exhibit spectral bias, which prioritizes low-frequency components while struggling to model high-frequency details. In this paper, we introduce PoseKAN, an adaptive graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), framework that extends KANs to graph-based learning for 2D-to-3D pose lifting from a single image. Unlike GCNs that use fixed activation functions, KANs employ learnable functions on graph edges, allowing data-driven, adaptive feature transformations. This enhances the model's adaptability and expressiveness, making it more expressive in learning complex pose variations. Our model employs multi-hop feature aggregation, ensuring the body joints can leverage information from both local and distant neighbors, leading to improved spatial awareness. It also incorporates residual PoseKAN blocks for deeper feature refinement, and a global response normalization for improved feature selectivity and contrast. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our model against state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出SIFT-Graph多模态防御框架，通过结合手工特征和深度学习特征来增强视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性，在保持清洁准确率的同时有效防御梯度白盒攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度视觉模型依赖密集像素级表示，对微小扰动高度敏感，而传统防御策略缺乏整合固有鲁棒视觉特征的机制。

Method: 集成SIFT关键点和图注意力网络，提取尺度旋转不变的局部结构特征，然后将这些鲁棒特征嵌入与传统视觉模型融合。

Result: 初步结果表明该方法能有效提升视觉模型对梯度白盒对抗攻击的鲁棒性，且清洁准确率仅轻微下降。

Conclusion: SIFT-Graph框架通过多模态特征融合成功增强了视觉模型的对抗鲁棒性，为构建结构感知的防御模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks expose a fundamental vulnerability in modern deep vision models by exploiting their dependence on dense, pixel-level representations that are highly sensitive to imperceptible perturbations. Traditional defense strategies typically operate within this fragile pixel domain, lacking mechanisms to incorporate inherently robust visual features. In this work, we introduce SIFT-Graph, a multimodal defense framework that enhances the robustness of traditional vision models by aggregating structurally meaningful features extracted from raw images using both handcrafted and learned modalities. Specifically, we integrate Scale-Invariant Feature Transform keypoints with a Graph Attention Network to capture scale and rotation invariant local structures that are resilient to perturbations. These robust feature embeddings are then fused with traditional vision model, such as Vision Transformer and Convolutional Neural Network, to form a unified, structure-aware and perturbation defensive model. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method effectively improves the visual model robustness against gradient-based white box adversarial attacks, while incurring only a marginal drop in clean accuracy.

Abstract: Generating novel views of a natural scene, e.g., every-day scenes both indoors and outdoors, from a single view is an under-explored problem, even though it is an organic extension to the object-centric novel view synthesis. Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的旋转不变学习方法SiPF，通过引入全局一致的参考点（阴影）来增强局部特征，解决了现有方法因感受野受限而无法区分几何相似但空间不同结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旋转不变学习方法使用手工设计的RI特征替代原始坐标，虽然对任意旋转具有鲁棒性，但会丢失全局姿态信息，无法区分几何相似但空间不同的结构（如飞机左右机翼）。

Method: 提出阴影信息姿态特征(SiPF)，通过学习的共享旋转生成全局一致参考点；设计旋转不变注意力卷积(RIAttnConv)将SiPF集成到特征聚合中；基于Bingham分布的任务自适应阴影定位模块动态学习最优全局旋转。

Result: 在3D分类和部件分割基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有RI方法，特别是在需要细粒度空间区分能力的任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SiPF方法通过结合局部旋转不变特征和全局姿态感知，有效解决了旋转不变学习中的Wing-tip特征崩溃问题，提升了模型对结构相似组件的区分能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in rotation-invariant (RI) learning for 3D point clouds typically replace raw coordinates with handcrafted RI features to ensure robustness under arbitrary rotations. However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于状态空间模型的方法通过手动设计的扫描操作将2D姿态序列展平为纯时间序列，破坏了人体姿态的固有空间结构，使空间和时间特征纠缠，难以捕捉复杂的姿态依赖关系。

Method: 提出SAS-SSM模型，首先使用结构感知的时空卷积动态捕捉关节间的局部交互，然后应用基于步长的扫描策略构建多尺度全局结构表示。

Result: 基于SAS-SSM的SasMamba模型在3D姿态估计任务中取得了有竞争力的性能，且参数量显著少于现有混合模型。

Conclusion: SAS-SSM能够灵活建模局部和全局姿态信息，同时保持线性计算复杂度，为3D人体姿态估计提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, the Mamba architecture based on State Space Models (SSMs) has gained attention in 3D human pose estimation due to its linear complexity and strong global modeling capability. However, existing SSM-based methods typically apply manually designed scan operations to flatten detected 2D pose sequences into purely temporal sequences, either locally or globally. This approach disrupts the inherent spatial structure of human poses and entangles spatial and temporal features, making it difficult to capture complex pose dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose the Skeleton Structure-Aware Stride SSM (SAS-SSM), which first employs a structure-aware spatiotemporal convolution to dynamically capture essential local interactions between joints, and then applies a stride-based scan strategy to construct multi-scale global structural representations. This enables flexible modeling of both local and global pose information while maintaining linear computational complexity. Built upon SAS-SSM, our model SasMamba achieves competitive 3D pose estimation performance with significantly fewer parameters compared to existing hybrid models.

Motivation: 现有对比学习网络通过参数共享或动量更新隐式交互，未能充分利用正样本对的互补性和相似性来提取聚类特征

Method: 设计MFAVBs模块：1)两个预处理增强作为正样本对输入共享权重的ViT；2)输出特征融合后输入更大的ViT；3)学习特征分割为新增强正样本对传入后续FAVBs；4)特征投影到实例级和聚类级空间计算交叉熵损失

Conclusion: 提出的MFAVBs通过多重融合和增强操作，有效提升了对比学习在图像聚类任务中的性能表现

Abstract: In the field of image clustering, the widely used contrastive learning networks improve clustering performance by maximizing the similarity between positive pairs and the dissimilarity of negative pairs of the inputs. Extant contrastive learning networks, whose two encoders often implicitly interact with each other by parameter sharing or momentum updating, may not fully exploit the complementarity and similarity of the positive pairs to extract clustering features from input data. To explicitly fuse the learned features of positive pairs, we design a novel multiple fusing-augmenting ViT blocks (MFAVBs) based on the excellent feature learning ability of Vision Transformers (ViT). Firstly, two preprocessed augmentions as positive pairs are separately fed into two shared-weight ViTs, then their output features are fused to input into a larger ViT. Secondly, the learned features are split into a pair of new augmented positive samples and passed to the next FAVBs, enabling multiple fusion and augmention through MFAVBs operations. Finally, the learned features are projected into both instance-level and clustering-level spaces to calculate the cross-entropy loss, followed by parameter updates by backpropagation to finalize the training process. To further enhance ability of the model to distinguish between similar images, our input data for the network we propose is preprocessed augmentions with features extracted from the CLIP pretrained model. Our experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that MFAVBs serving as the backbone for contrastive clustering outperforms the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of clustering performance.

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common aggressive, fast-growing brain tumor, with a grim prognosis. Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \& Eosin (H\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

Abstract: Object recognition plays a fundamental role in how biological organisms perceive and interact with their environment. While the human visual system performs this task with remarkable efficiency, reproducing similar capabilities in artificial systems remains challenging. This study investigates VisNet, a biologically inspired neural network model, and several enhanced variants incorporating radial basis function neurons, Mahalanobis distance based learning, and retinal like preprocessing for both general object recognition and symmetry classification. By leveraging principles of Hebbian learning and temporal continuity associating temporally adjacent views to build invariant representations. VisNet and its extensions capture robust and transformation invariant features. Experimental results across multiple datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and custom symmetric object sets, show that these enhanced VisNet variants substantially improve recognition accuracy compared with the baseline model. These findings underscore the adaptability and biological relevance of VisNet inspired architectures, offering a powerful and interpretable framework for visual recognition in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

Result: 在6种不同模型架构和多个数据集上，与7种现有方法相比，该框架实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SemBridge框架有效解决了弱语义一致性下的跨模态知识传输问题，为现实场景中的跨模态学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation has demonstrated promising performance on paired modalities with strong semantic connections, referred to as Symmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (SCKD). However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization. To facilitate the research, we curate a benchmark dataset derived from two modalities, namely Multi-Spectral (MS) and asymmetric RGB images, tailored for remote sensing scene classification. Comprehensive experiments exhibit that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with 7 existing approaches on 6 different model architectures across various datasets.

Abstract: Document layout understanding remains data-intensive despite advances in semi-supervised learning. We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.

Abstract: Unsupervised remote sensing change detection aims to monitor and analyze changes from multi-temporal remote sensing images in the same geometric region at different times, without the need for labeled training data. Previous unsupervised methods attempt to achieve style transfer across multi-temporal remote sensing images through reconstruction by a generator network, and then capture the unreconstructable areas as the changed regions. However, it often leads to poor performance due to generator overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel Consistency Change Detection Framework (CCDF) to address this challenge. Specifically, we introduce a Cycle Consistency (CC) module to reduce the overfitting issues in the generator-based reconstruction. Additionally, we propose a Semantic Consistency (SC) module to enable detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: HitoMi-Cam不是CNN检测器的替代品，而是在形状不可预测环境（如灾难救援）中边缘设备实时运行的可行补充工具。

Abstract: While convolutional neural network (CNN)-based object detection is widely used, it exhibits a shape dependency that degrades performance for postures not included in the training data. Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.

Conclusion: NES方法有效解决了零样本图像描述中的幻觉问题，通过负实体抑制机制显著提升了跨域泛化性能

Abstract: Text-only training provides an attractive approach to address data scarcity challenges in zero-shot image captioning (ZIC), avoiding the expense of collecting paired image-text annotations. However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

Abstract: Deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on edge devices (e.g., smartphones and robots) is crucial for enabling low-latency and privacy-preserving intelligent applications. Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Abstract: Human-machine collaborative compression has been receiving increasing research efforts for reducing image/video data, serving as the basis for both human perception and machine intelligence. Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The inference latency of diffusion models remains a critical barrier to their real-time application. While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a "lossy compressor", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability. Our method establishes a robust new paradigm for high-fidelity, single-step diffusion models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集成攻击在异构模型架构间的迁移效果不佳，主要原因是异构代理模型的梯度更新方向差异很大，难以在充分利用个体模型的同时减少集成模型的梯度方差。

Method: 设计NAMEA集成攻击，首次将集成模型中非注意力区域的梯度整合到迭代梯度优化过程中。通过元学习方式分别合并注意力和非注意力区域的梯度，融合CNN和ViT的迁移信息。

Conclusion: 这是首次探索集成非注意力在提升跨架构可迁移性方面的能力，为发起集成攻击提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Ensemble attacks integrate the outputs of surrogate models with diverse architectures, which can be combined with various gradient-based attacks to improve adversarial transferability. However, previous work shows unsatisfactory attack performance when transferring across heterogeneous model architectures. The main reason is that the gradient update directions of heterogeneous surrogate models differ widely, making it hard to reduce the gradient variance of ensemble models while making the best of individual model. To tackle this challenge, we design a novel ensemble attack, NAMEA, which for the first time integrates the gradients from the non-attention areas of ensemble models into the iterative gradient optimization process. Our design is inspired by the observation that the attention areas of heterogeneous models vary sharply, thus the non-attention areas of ViTs are likely to be the focus of CNNs and vice versa. Therefore, we merge the gradients respectively from the attention and non-attention areas of ensemble models so as to fuse the transfer information of CNNs and ViTs. Specifically, we pioneer a new way of decoupling the gradients of non-attention areas from those of attention areas, while merging gradients by meta-learning. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet dataset indicate that NAMEA outperforms AdaEA and SMER, the state-of-the-art ensemble attacks by an average of 15.0% and 9.6%, respectively. This work is the first attempt to explore the power of ensemble non-attention in boosting cross-architecture transferability, providing new insights into launching ensemble attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的双向参考帧协调视频压缩方法BRHVC，通过双向运动收敛和双向上下文融合来优化双向参考帧的利用，在HEVC数据集上超越了现有最先进的神经视频压缩方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经B帧视频压缩相比P帧压缩研究较少，虽然双向参考帧能提供更好的压缩性能，但层次化编码可能导致连续时间预测复杂化，特别是在帧跨度较大的层次级别，使得两个参考帧的贡献不平衡。

Method: 提出BRHVC方法，包含双向运动收敛(BMC)和双向上下文融合(BCF)。BMC在运动压缩中收敛多个光流，实现更大尺度的精确运动补偿；BCF在运动补偿精度指导下显式建模参考上下文的权重。

Result: 实验结果表明，BRHVC超越了之前最先进的神经视频压缩方法，甚至在HEVC数据集上超过了传统编码方法VTM-RA（随机访问配置）。

Conclusion: 通过更高效的运动和上下文处理，BRHVC能够有效协调双向参考帧，在视频压缩性能上取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has made significant progress in recent years, while neural B-frame video compression (NBVC) remains underexplored compared to P-frame compression. NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Motivation: 分形生成模型(FGM)能高效生成高质量图像，但其固有的自相似性限制了输出图像的多样性，需要解决多样性不足的问题

Conclusion: 这是首次将Hausdorff维度引入FGM的工作，有效提升了生成输出的多样性，并为FGM发展提供了理论贡献

Abstract: Improving the diversity of generated results while maintaining high visual quality remains a significant challenge in image generation tasks. Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM. Our method effectively enhances the diversity of generated outputs while offering a principled theoretical contribution to FGM development.

Motivation: 随着无纸化工作流程的普及，传统墨水签名正转向电子格式，但静态扫描签名由于便利性仍然普遍使用。这些静态图像几乎失去了认证属性，无法可靠验证且容易遭受恶意复制和重用。

Conclusion: AuthSig框架成功地将认证信息绑定到签名图像中，为静态电子签名提供了可靠的安全保障，解决了传统静态签名易被复制和滥用的安全问题。

Abstract: With the deepening trend of paperless workflows, signatures as a means of identity authentication are gradually shifting from traditional ink-on-paper to electronic formats.Despite the availability of dynamic pressure-sensitive and PKI-based digital signatures, static scanned signatures remain prevalent in practice due to their convenience. However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding. Experimental results show that AuthSig achieves over 98% extraction accuracy under both digital-domain distortions and signature-specific degradations, and remains effective even in print-scan scenarios.

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs), enabling them to leverage a few examples directly from input contexts. However, the effectiveness of this approach is heavily reliant on the selection of demonstrations, a process that is NP-hard. Traditional strategies, including random, similarity-based sampling and infoscore-based sampling, often lead to inefficiencies or suboptimal performance, struggling to balance both efficiency and effectiveness in demonstration selection. In this paper, we propose a novel demonstration selection framework named Coreset-based Dual Retrieval (CoDR). We show that samples within a diverse subset achieve a higher expected mutual information. To implement this, we introduce a cluster-pruning method to construct a diverse coreset that aligns more effectively with the query while maintaining diversity. Additionally, we develop a dual retrieval mechanism that enhances the selection process by achieving global demonstration selection while preserving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the ICL performance compared to the existing strategies, providing a robust solution for effective and efficient demonstration selection.

Abstract: Microaneurysms (MAs), the earliest pathognomonic signs of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), present as sub-60 $μm$ lesions in fundus images with highly variable photometric and morphological characteristics, rendering manual screening not only labor-intensive but inherently error-prone. While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to "identity mapping", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid "identity mapping" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a core task in image processing, yet many methods degrade when images are heavily corrupted by noise and exhibit intensity inhomogeneity. Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world images with intensity inhomogeneity and diverse noise types show that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy and robustness compared with competing approaches.

Conclusion: 负向提示是推进开放集视觉识别系统的关键新维度。

Abstract: Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival). This work establishes negative prompts as a crucial new dimension for advancing open-set visual recognition systems.

Abstract: Object hallucination remains a critical challenge in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where models generate content inconsistent with visual inputs. Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Additionally, we introduce a fully spatial correlation module to further improve accuracy while maintaining low computational costs. We incorporate the just noticeable difference to encourage our model to focus on image regions more sensitive to distortions, eliminating noticeable alignment errors. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Ground-based remote sensing cloud image sequence extrapolation is a key research area in the development of photovoltaic power systems. However, existing approaches exhibit several limitations:(1)they primarily rely on static kernels to augment feature information, lacking adaptive mechanisms to extract features at varying resolutions dynamically;(2)temporal guidance is insufficient, leading to suboptimal modeling of long-range spatiotemporal dependencies; and(3)the quadratic computational cost of attention mechanisms is often overlooked, limiting efficiency in practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose USF-Net, a Unified Spatiotemporal Fusion Network that integrates adaptive large-kernel convolutions and a low-complexity attention mechanism, combining temporal flow information within an encoder-decoder framework. Specifically, the encoder employs three basic layers to extract features. Followed by the USTM, which comprises:(1)a SiB equipped with a SSM that dynamically captures multi-scale contextual information, and(2)a TiB featuring a TAM that effectively models long-range temporal dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In addition, a DSM with a TGM is introduced to enable unified modeling of temporally guided spatiotemporal dependencies. On the decoder side, a DUM is employed to address the common "ghosting effect." It utilizes the initial temporal state as an attention operator to preserve critical motion signatures. As a key contribution, we also introduce and release the ASI-CIS dataset. Extensive experiments on ASI-CIS demonstrate that USF-Net significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a superior balance between prediction accuracy and computational efficiency for ground-based cloud extrapolation.

Motivation: 解决UHD图像去雾面临的挑战：先验方法场景适应性有限，深度学习方法计算复杂度高且存在颜色失真问题。

Method: 1) 基于流匹配和雾霾感知向量场建模去雾过程；2) 提出可学习的3D查找表编码雾霾变换参数；3) 使用四阶Runge-Kutta ODE求解器稳定求解去雾流场。

Result: 在实验中超越7种最先进方法，PSNR提升2dB，在密集雾霾和颜色保真度方面表现更好。

Conclusion: 4KDehazeFlow是一种通用方法，兼容各种深度学习网络，通过流匹配和3D LUT实现了高效高质量的去雾效果。

Abstract: Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) image dehazing faces challenges such as limited scene adaptability in prior-based methods and high computational complexity with color distortion in deep learning approaches. To address these issues, we propose 4KDehazeFlow, a novel method based on Flow Matching and the Haze-Aware vector field. This method models the dehazing process as a progressive optimization of continuous vector field flow, providing efficient data-driven adaptive nonlinear color transformation for high-quality dehazing. Specifically, our method has the following advantages: 1) 4KDehazeFlow is a general method compatible with various deep learning networks, without relying on any specific network architecture. 2) We propose a learnable 3D lookup table (LUT) that encodes haze transformation parameters into a compact 3D mapping matrix, enabling efficient inference through precomputed mappings. 3) We utilize a fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) ordinary differential equation (ODE) solver to stably solve the dehazing flow field through an accurate step-by-step iterative method, effectively suppressing artifacts. Extensive experiments show that 4KDehazeFlow exceeds seven state-of-the-art methods. It delivers a 2dB PSNR increase and better performance in dense haze and color fidelity.

TL;DR: PAN是一个通用的、可交互的、长视野的世界模型，通过高质量的视频模拟预测未来世界状态，结合了基于LLM的自回归潜在动态骨干和视频扩散解码器，实现潜在空间推理与世界动态的统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏因果控制、交互性和长视野一致性，而现有世界模型往往局限于特定领域且泛化能力有限。需要构建一个能够支持开放领域、动作条件模拟且具有长期动态一致性的通用世界模型。

Method: 采用生成潜在预测(GLP)架构，结合基于大语言模型的自回归潜在动态骨干（支持语言指定动作）和视频扩散解码器（重建感知细节和时序一致的视觉观察），在大规模视频-动作对数据上训练。

Result: 实验表明PAN在动作条件世界模拟、长视野预测和模拟推理方面表现优异，优于其他视频生成器和世界模型。

Conclusion: PAN朝着通用世界模型迈出了一步，能够为推理和行动提供未来世界状态的预测模拟。

Abstract: A world model enables an intelligent agent to imagine, predict, and reason about how the world evolves in response to its actions, and accordingly to plan and strategize. While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.

Conclusion: 该框架通过可解释性和文化敏感性，支持教育和文化保护，揭示了计算原理和底层文化背景。

Abstract: Contemporary Visual Question Answering (VQA) systems remain constrained when confronted with culturally specific content, largely because cultural knowledge is under-represented in training corpora and the reasoning process is not rendered interpretable to end users. This paper introduces VietMEAgent, a multimodal explainable framework engineered for Vietnamese cultural understanding. The method integrates a cultural object detection backbone with a structured program generation layer, yielding a pipeline in which answer prediction and explanation are tightly coupled. A curated knowledge base of Vietnamese cultural entities serves as an explicit source of background information, while a dual-modality explanation module combines attention-based visual evidence with structured, human-readable textual rationales. We further construct a Vietnamese Cultural VQA dataset sourced from public repositories and use it to demonstrate the practicality of programming-based methodologies for cultural AI. The resulting system provides transparent explanations that disclose both the computational rationale and the underlying cultural context, supporting education and cultural preservation with an emphasis on interpretability and cultural sensitivity.

Motivation: 现有对抗性防御方法TTC由于优化目标限制，生成的对抗样本多样性不足，无法有效应对广泛的对抗攻击

Method: 提出方向正交对抗攻击(DOC)，结合正交梯度方向和动量更新来扩展对抗样本搜索空间，并引入基于平均余弦相似度的方向敏感度评分来调节对抗强度

Result: 在16个数据集上的实验表明，DOC在各种攻击下提高了对抗鲁棒性，同时保持了竞争力的干净准确率

Conclusion: DOC通过增强对抗样本的多样性和覆盖范围，有效提升了视觉语言预训练模型的对抗鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training models (VLPs) demonstrate strong multimodal understanding and zero-shot generalization, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial examples, raising concerns about their reliability. Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

Abstract: Compositional generalization has achieved substantial progress in computer vision on pre-collected training data. Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL. Furthermore, we propose a pseudo-replay framework utilizing a visual synthesizer to synthesize visual representations of learned compositions and a linguistic primitive distillation mechanism to maintain aligned primitive representations across the learning process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

*Byunghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UL-TTA是一种无需训练和反向传播的测试时自适应框架，通过在线EM风格过程仅调整logit级参数（类别原型、先验和温度），在域偏移下显著提升CLIP等视觉语言模型的准确性和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法需要反向传播、协方差估计或大量内存，不适合流式和边缘场景。VLMs在域偏移下存在特征漂移、类别先验不匹配和严重校准错误问题。

Method: 冻结主干网络，仅在线调整logit级参数：使用选择性样本过滤、基于文本和Dirichlet先验的闭式贝叶斯更新、解耦的温度参数，以及轻量级防护机制防止长流漂移。

Result: 在多个大规模跨域和OOD基准测试中，UL-TTA相比零样本CLIP平均提升4.7%的top-1准确率，ECE降低20-30%，延迟开销小于8%，在长达20万样本的流式测试中无崩溃。

Conclusion: logit级贝叶斯自适应足以在域偏移下为VLMs获得最先进的准确率-校准权衡，无需更新任何主干网络参数。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition by comparing image embeddings to text-derived class prototypes. However, under domain shift, they suffer from feature drift, class-prior mismatch, and severe miscalibration. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often require backpropagation through large backbones, covariance estimation, or heavy memory/state, which is problematic for streaming and edge scenarios. We propose Ultra-Light Test-Time Adaptation (UL-TTA), a fully training-free and backprop-free framework that freezes the backbone and adapts only logit-level parameters: class prototypes, class priors, and temperature. UL-TTA performs an online EM-style procedure with (i) selective sample filtering to use only confident predictions, (ii) closed-form Bayesian updates for prototypes and priors anchored by text and Dirichlet priors, (iii) decoupled temperatures for prediction vs. calibration, and (iv) lightweight guards (norm clipping, prior KL constraints, smoothed temperature) to prevent drift in long streams. Across large-scale cross-domain and OOD benchmarks (PACS, Office-Home, DomainNet, Terra Incognita, ImageNet-R/A/V2/Sketch; ~726K test samples) and strong TTA baselines including Tent, T3A, CoTTA, SAR, Tip-Adapter, and FreeTTA, UL-TTA consistently improves top-1 accuracy (e.g., +4.7 points over zero-shot CLIP on average) while reducing ECE by 20-30%, with less than 8% latency overhead. Long-stream experiments up to 200K samples show no collapse. Our results demonstrate that logit-level Bayesian adaptation is sufficient to obtain state-of-the-art accuracy-calibration trade-offs for VLMs under domain shift, without updating any backbone parameters.

Conclusion: DKDS数据集填补了草书体日文文档处理中噪声挑战的空白，为相关研究提供了新的基准和基线方法。

Abstract: Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods. The DKDS dataset and the implementation code for baseline methods are available at https://ruiyangju.github.io/DKDS.

Conclusion: PIFF通过整合物理信息约束与数据驱动学习，能够准确捕捉降雨、地形、简化淹没模型与洪水之间的因果关系，实现精确的实时洪水测绘。

Abstract: Flood mapping is crucial for assessing and mitigating flood impacts, yet traditional methods like numerical modeling and aerial photography face limitations in efficiency and reliability. To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.

Result: 在9个开放任务和23个大模型上的实验表明，MACEval实现了人工自由、高效经济、灵活可扩展的评估效果。

Conclusion: MACEval为大模型评估开辟了新的方向，提供了一种可持续的动态评估框架。

Abstract: Hundreds of benchmarks dedicated to evaluating large models from multiple perspectives have been presented over the past few years. Albeit substantial efforts, most of them remain closed-ended and are prone to overfitting due to the potential data contamination in the ever-growing training corpus of large models, thereby undermining the credibility of the evaluation. Moreover, the increasing scale and scope of current benchmarks with transient metrics, as well as the heavily human-dependent curation procedure, pose significant challenges for timely maintenance and adaptation to gauge the advancing capabilities of large models. In this paper, we introduce MACEval, a \Multi-Agent Continual Evaluation network for dynamic evaluation of large models, and define a new set of metrics to quantify performance longitudinally and sustainably. MACEval adopts an interactive and autonomous evaluation mode that employs role assignment, in-process data generation, and evaluation routing through a cascaded agent network. Extensive experiments on 9 open-ended tasks with 23 participating large models demonstrate that MACEval is (1) human-free and automatic, mitigating laborious result processing with inter-agent judgment guided; (2) efficient and economical, reducing a considerable amount of data and overhead to obtain similar results compared to related benchmarks; and (3) flexible and scalable, migrating or integrating existing benchmarks via customized evaluation topologies. We hope that MACEval can broaden future directions of large model evaluation.

Abstract: Multi-person global human mesh recovery (HMR) is crucial for understanding crowd dynamics and interactions. Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Abstract: This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\times$ on average. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 基于扩散模型反演的潜在空间动态分析为AI生成视频检测提供了有效方法，解决了现有像素级检测器的泛化问题。

Abstract: AI-generated video has advanced rapidly and poses serious challenges to content security and forensic analysis. Existing detectors rely mainly on pixel-level visual cues and generalize poorly to unseen generators. We propose DBINDS, a diffusion-model-inversion based detector that analyzes latent-space dynamics rather than pixels. We find that initial noise sequences recovered by diffusion inversion differ systematically between real and generated videos. Building on this, DBINDS forms an Initial Noise Difference Sequence (INDS) and extracts multi-domain, multi-scale features. With feature optimization and a LightGBM classifier tuned by Bayesian search, DBINDS (trained on a single generator) achieves strong cross-generator performance on GenVidBench, demonstrating good generalization and robustness in limited-data settings.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate dermatology diagnostic narratives directly from images. However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: TACO是一个通过自验证和置信度校准来减少多模态大语言模型幻觉的框架，无需外部视觉专家，在多个基准测试中表现优于直接提示和视觉对比解码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型经常出现幻觉问题，特别是在对象存在性、属性和关系方面的错误，这影响了模型的可靠性。

Method: TACO将响应分解为原子查询，通过改写减少对措辞的敏感性，使用自一致性（黑盒）或自置信度（灰盒）聚合来估计置信度，最后用语言模型精炼答案。

Result: 在五个基准测试（POPE、MME、HallusionBench、AMBER和MM-Hal Bench）和两个MLLM模型上的实验表明，TACO始终优于直接提示和视觉对比解码，减少了系统偏差并改善了置信度校准。

Conclusion: TACO框架有效增强了多模态大语言模型的忠实性，证明了其在缓解幻觉问题方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often suffer from hallucinations, particularly errors in object existence, attributes, or relations, which undermine their reliability. We introduce TACO (Verified Atomic Confidence Estimation), a simple framework that mitigates hallucinations through self-verification and confidence calibration without relying on external vision experts. TACO decomposes responses into atomic queries, paraphrases them to reduce sensitivity to wording, and estimates confidence using self-consistency (black-box) or self-confidence (gray-box) aggregation, before refining answers with a language model. Experiments on five benchmarks (POPE, MME, HallusionBench, AMBER, and MM-Hal Bench) with two MLLMs (\texttt{LLaVA-1.5-7B} and \texttt{CogVLM2}) show that TACO consistently outperforms direct prompting and Visual Contrastive Decoding, reduces systematic biases, and improves confidence calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the faithfulness of MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出空间信息瓶颈(S-IB)框架，从信息论角度理解梯度归因，通过优化VJP的空间结构来解耦特征表示，提升模型可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常学习空间纠缠的表示，将判别性前景特征与虚假背景相关性混在一起，削弱了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 从信息论角度证明VJP构成输入特征关于类别标签的最小充分统计量，提出编码-解码视角：前向传播将输入编码到类别空间，反向传播中的VJP将此编码解码回特征空间。通过最大化前景VJP与输入的互信息，同时最小化背景区域的互信息，实现空间信息解耦。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在六种解释方法上均取得普遍改进，实现了更好的前景集中和背景抑制，且无需方法特定调优，同时获得一致的分类准确率提升。

Conclusion: S-IB框架通过直接优化训练期间VJP的空间结构，有效提升了各种解释范式的可视化质量，为梯度归因提供了新的信息论理解视角。

Abstract: Deep neural networks typically learn spatially entangled representations that conflate discriminative foreground features with spurious background correlations, thereby undermining model interpretability and robustness. We propose a novel understanding framework for gradient-based attribution from an information-theoretic perspective. We prove that, under mild conditions, the Vector-Jacobian Products (VJP) computed during backpropagation form minimal sufficient statistics of input features with respect to class labels. Motivated by this finding, we propose an encoding-decoding perspective : forward propagation encodes inputs into class space, while VJP in backpropagation decodes this encoding back to feature space. Therefore, we propose Spatial Information Bottleneck (S-IB) to spatially disentangle information flow. By maximizing mutual information between foreground VJP and inputs while minimizing mutual information in background regions, S-IB encourages networks to encode information only in class-relevant spatial regions. Since post-hoc explanation methods fundamentally derive from VJP computations, directly optimizing VJP's spatial structure during training improves visualization quality across diverse explanation paradigms. Experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate universal improvements across six explanation methods, achieving better foreground concentration and background suppression without method-specific tuning, alongside consistent classification accuracy gains.

Abstract: The Animation-based Generative Codec (AGC) is an emerging paradigm for talking-face video compression. However, deploying its intricate decoder on resource and power-constrained edge devices presents challenges due to numerous parameters, the inflexibility to adapt to dynamically evolving algorithms, and the high power consumption induced by extensive computations and data transmission. This paper for the first time proposes a novel field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs)-oriented AGC deployment scheme for edge-computing video services. Initially, we analyze the AGC algorithm and employ network compression methods including post-training static quantization and layer fusion techniques. Subsequently, we design an overlapped accelerator utilizing the co-processor paradigm to perform computations through software-hardware co-design. The hardware processing unit comprises engines such as convolution, grid sampling, upsample, etc. Parallelization optimization strategies like double-buffered pipelines and loop unrolling are employed to fully exploit the resources of FPGA. Ultimately, we establish an AGC FPGA prototype on the PYNQ-Z1 platform using the proposed scheme, achieving \textbf{24.9$\times$} and \textbf{4.1$\times$} higher energy efficiency against commercial Central Processing Unit (CPU) and Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), respectively. Specifically, only \textbf{11.7} microjoules ($\upmu$J) are required for one pixel reconstructed by this FPGA system.

Method: 比较经典基线方法与新型神经网络架构，评估单个信号、信号对和分组传感器输入在不同身体活动中的表现。

Result: 分钟通气量是最佳单个信号，Transformer模型表现最优；低强度活动误差更低（RMSE低至0.29 W/kg），高强度活动误差较大但归一化误差相当；存在显著的个体间差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了信号选择和神经网络架构的重要性，并指出需要自适应建模策略来处理个体间差异。

Abstract: Energy expenditure estimation aims to infer human metabolic rate from physiological signals such as heart rate, respiration, or accelerometer data, and has been studied primarily with classical regression methods. The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies. Our code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/Sarvibabakhani/deeplearning-biosignals-ee .

Abstract: Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method, Enriching Knowledge Distillation (RichKD), consistently outperforms most existing baselines across multiple benchmarks and exhibits stronger robustness under distribution shifts and input corruptions.

Abstract: The rise of 3D generative models has enabled automatic 3D geometry and texture synthesis from multimodal inputs (e.g., text or images). However, these methods often ignore physical constraints and manufacturability considerations. In this work, we address the challenge of producing 3D designs that are both lightweight and self-supporting. We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, our method could improve the stability and maintain high geometric fidelity. Real-world 3D-printing experiments confirm that our hollow designs can be reliably fabricated and could be self-supporting.

Abstract: The teacher-student paradigm has emerged as a canonical framework in semi-supervised learning. When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors. Comprehensive evaluations on three medical image benchmarks demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing error propagation in semi-supervised medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Camera-based multi-view 3D detection is crucial for autonomous driving. PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection (IRSTD) plays a critical role in practical applications, such as surveillance of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and UAV-based search system. Moving IRSTD still remains highly challenging due to weak target features and complex background interference. Accurate spatio-temporal feature modeling is crucial for moving target detection, typically achieved through either temporal differences or spatio-temporal (3D) convolutions. Temporal difference can explicitly leverage motion cues but exhibits limited capability in extracting spatial features, whereas 3D convolution effectively represents spatio-temporal features yet lacks explicit awareness of motion dynamics along the temporal dimension. In this paper, we propose a novel moving IRSTD network (TDCNet), which effectively extracts and enhances spatio-temporal features for accurate target detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel temporal difference convolution (TDC) re-parameterization module that comprises three parallel TDC blocks designed to capture contextual dependencies across different temporal ranges. Each TDC block fuses temporal difference and 3D convolution into a unified spatio-temporal convolution representation. This re-parameterized module can effectively capture multi-scale motion contextual features while suppressing pseudo-motion clutter in complex backgrounds, significantly improving detection performance. Moreover, we propose a TDC-guided spatio-temporal attention mechanism that performs cross-attention between the spatio-temporal features from the TDC-based backbone and a parallel 3D backbone. This mechanism models their global semantic dependencies to refine the current frame's features. Extensive experiments on IRSTD-UAV and public infrared datasets demonstrate that our TDCNet achieves state-of-the-art detection performance in moving target detection.

Abstract: Recognizing unseen skeleton action categories remains highly challenging due to the absence of corresponding skeletal priors. Existing approaches generally follow an "align-then-classify" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\texttt{$\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\textbf{F}$lexib$\textbf{L}$e neighb$\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\% of the seen data.

Abstract: Accurate intra-operative localization of the bronchoscope tip relative to patient anatomy remains challenging due to respiratory motion, anatomical variability, and CT-to-body divergence that cause deformation and misalignment between intra-operative views and pre-operative CT. Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.

Abstract: Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a critical role in analyzing player behavior from videos, enabling performance evaluation. Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches. This work thus enables robust detection and tracking of American football players in challenging, high-density scenarios previously underserved by conventional methods.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved strong performance in video action recognition, but their high computational cost limits their practicality. Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.

*Jerrin Bright,Yuhao Chen,John S. Zelek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DreamPose3D是一个基于扩散模型的3D人体姿态估计框架，结合动作感知推理和时间想象力，通过动作提示、关节关系建模和幻觉姿态解码器实现精准的3D姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D人体姿态估计方法主要依赖几何线索并独立预测每个姿态，无法解决运动模糊问题且难以泛化到真实场景。受人类理解和预测运动方式的启发，需要结合高层意图推理和时间一致性建模。

Method: 1) 使用从2D姿态序列提取的动作提示动态调节去噪过程；2) 引入表示编码器，在注意力机制中融入关节运动学亲和力；3) 幻觉姿态解码器在训练中预测时间一致的3D姿态序列，模拟人类心理重建运动轨迹的过程。

Result: 在Human3.6M和MPI-3DHP基准测试中达到最先进性能，在广播棒球数据集上表现出强大的鲁棒性，能够有效处理模糊和噪声的2D输入，保持时间一致性并处理意图驱动的运动变化。

Conclusion: DreamPose3D通过结合动作感知推理、关节关系建模和时间想象力，显著提升了3D人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理模糊运动和真实场景方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate 3D human pose estimation remains a critical yet unresolved challenge, requiring both temporal coherence across frames and fine-grained modeling of joint relationships. However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: vMFCoOp是一个在超球面上使用von Mises-Fisher分布对齐LLM和CLIP语义偏差的框架，通过统一语义锚点实现稳健的生物医学提示学习和优越的小样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临LLM与CLIP变体之间的语义不对齐问题，缺乏跨基础模型族的可扩展性，且传统欧几里得空间优化无法建模统一表示或应用局部几何约束，在复杂生物医学成像中会加剧模态差距并破坏小样本适应的稳定性。

Method: 提出vMFCoOp框架，在共享超球面上逆估计von Mises-Fisher分布，通过统一语义锚点对齐任意LLM和CLIP骨干网络之间的语义偏差。

Result: 在14个医学数据集、12种医学成像模态和13个解剖区域上均表现出持续改进，在准确性、泛化性和临床适用性方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该工作将持续扩展以涵盖更多下游应用，相关资源将通过GitHub共享。

Abstract: Recent advances in context optimization (CoOp) guided by large language model (LLM)-distilled medical semantic priors offer a scalable alternative to manual prompt engineering and full fine-tuning for adapting biomedical CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs). However, prompt learning in this context is challenged by semantic misalignment between LLMs and CLIP variants due to divergent training corpora and model architectures; it further lacks scalability across continuously evolving families of foundation models. More critically, pairwise multimodal alignment via conventional Euclidean-space optimization lacks the capacity to model unified representations or apply localized geometric constraints, which tends to amplify modality gaps in complex biomedical imaging and destabilize few-shot adaptation. In this work, we propose vMFCoOp, a framework that inversely estimates von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distributions on a shared Hyperspherical Manifold, aligning semantic biases between arbitrary LLMs and CLIP backbones via Unified Semantic Anchors to achieve robust biomedical prompting and superior few-shot classification. Grounded in three complementary constraints, vMFCoOp demonstrates consistent improvements across 14 medical datasets, 12 medical imaging modalities, and 13 anatomical regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, generalization, and clinical applicability. This work will be continuously expanded to encompass more downstream applications, and the corresponding resources are intended to be shared through https://github.com/VinyehShaw/UniEqui.

*Isaac Robinson,Peter Robicheaux,Matvei Popov,Deva Ramanan,Neehar Peri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RF-DETR是一种轻量级专业检测变换器，通过神经架构搜索发现目标数据集的精度-延迟帕累托曲线，显著提升了实时检测器在COCO和Roboflow100-VL上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇检测器在COCO上表现优异，但在包含预训练中未见类别的真实世界数据集上泛化能力不足。作者希望开发一种轻量级解决方案，而非简单微调大型视觉语言模型。

Method: 使用权重共享神经架构搜索，在目标数据集上微调预训练基础网络，评估数千种不同精度-延迟权衡的网络配置而无需重新训练，并重新审视NAS的可调参数以改进DETR在不同目标域的迁移性。

Result: RF-DETR在COCO上显著优于现有最先进实时方法：RF-DETR(nano)在COCO上达到48.0 AP，比D-FINE(nano)高5.3 AP且延迟相似；RF-DETR(2x-large)在Roboflow100-VL上比GroundingDINO(tiny)高1.2 AP且快20倍，是首个在COCO上超过60 AP的实时检测器。

Conclusion: RF-DETR通过神经架构搜索有效平衡精度与延迟，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的实时检测性能，为开放词汇检测提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary detectors achieve impressive performance on COCO, but often fail to generalize to real-world datasets with out-of-distribution classes not typically found in their pre-training. Rather than simply fine-tuning a heavy-weight vision-language model (VLM) for new domains, we introduce RF-DETR, a light-weight specialist detection transformer that discovers accuracy-latency Pareto curves for any target dataset with weight-sharing neural architecture search (NAS). Our approach fine-tunes a pre-trained base network on a target dataset and evaluates thousands of network configurations with different accuracy-latency tradeoffs without re-training. Further, we revisit the "tunable knobs" for NAS to improve the transferability of DETRs to diverse target domains. Notably, RF-DETR significantly improves on prior state-of-the-art real-time methods on COCO and Roboflow100-VL. RF-DETR (nano) achieves 48.0 AP on COCO, beating D-FINE (nano) by 5.3 AP at similar latency, and RF-DETR (2x-large) outperforms GroundingDINO (tiny) by 1.2 AP on Roboflow100-VL while running 20x as fast. To the best of our knowledge, RF-DETR (2x-large) is the first real-time detector to surpass 60 AP on COCO. Our code is at https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr

*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter是一个基于异构图学习的个性化LLM路由框架，通过表示用户-LLM多轮交互来捕获用户偏好，在少样本数据下实现有效个性化路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM路由方法缺乏完全个性化，难以捕获用户与LLM之间的复杂交互，且用户偏好数据通常稀缺、嘈杂、格式不一致。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为包含用户、LLM、查询和响应四种节点类型的异构图，通过定制化消息传递机制在轻量级归纳图学习框架中学习用户偏好。

Result: 在多个数据集上持续优于强基线，准确率提高0.9-21.6%，AUC提高0.006-0.309，且能仅用少样本数据适应新用户和演化偏好。

Conclusion: GMTRouter通过图表示学习有效解决了LLM路由中的个性化挑战，在少样本场景下表现出色，无需大量微调即可适应新用户和变化偏好。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

TL;DR: LLMs能够生成足够逼真的社交媒体对话，人类参与者误判为真实对话的概率达39%，特别是Llama 3生成的对话被正确识别为AI的概率仅56%，略高于随机猜测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs模拟社交媒体群体对话的有效性，测试其能否逼真地模仿人类对话，为社交模拟应用提供验证。

Method: 从Reddit收集真实人类对话，使用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o在同一话题上生成人工对话，通过参与者侧边对比测试识别准确性。

Result: LLM生成的对话被误判为人类创作的概率为39%，Llama 3生成的对话被正确识别为AI的概率仅56%，接近随机水平。

Conclusion: LLMs能够生成足以欺骗人类的社交媒体对话，既展示了社交模拟的潜力，也警示了可能被滥用于制造虚假社交媒体内容的风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

TL;DR: LLMs在法律分析中具有潜力但存在安全漏洞，可能生成生物武器制造指南。研究提出结合知识图谱和RAG的方法评估LLM对法律的理解和安全风险，发现其推理和安全机制存在显著局限，需要加强安全协议和法律推理框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在解释复杂法律框架方面具有变革潜力，但存在矛盾：既能分析法律，又可能生成危险输出。需要系统评估LLM对生物武器相关法律的理解和安全风险。

Method: 提出结合知识图谱构建和检索增强生成(RAG)的方法论，通过结构化实验评估LLM识别法律违规、生成禁止指令和检测非法意图的能力。

Result: 研究发现LLM的推理和安全机制存在显著局限性，在生物武器相关场景中可能产生不安全输出。

Conclusion: 通过增强安全协议和更强大的法律推理框架，可以为开发能够道德安全地协助敏感法律领域的LLM奠定基础，确保它们成为法律的保护者而非无意中的违法促成者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐算法（如RLHF和DPO）显著降低了LLM输出的多样性，导致文本结构重复、词汇选择单一、问题解决方法趋同，以及社会视角范围变窄。

Method: 提出Soft Preference Learning方法，解构KL散度正则化中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM生成多样性的精细控制。

Result: 从能力角度看，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在困难重复采样任务中准确率更高，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性；从对齐角度看，能够代表更广泛的社会观点，并显示改进的logit校准。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning是对标准温度缩放的帕累托改进，能够有效平衡LLM对齐与输出多样性之间的权衡。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

Motivation: Tree-of-Thought推理虽然提升了LLM的问题解决能力，但由于语义冗余导致计算成本高昂，不同分支可能探索等效的推理路径。

Method: 引入语义相似性动态剪枝(SSDP)，将在线语义合并集成到并行树搜索中，实时聚类和剪枝冗余步骤。

Result: 在GSM8K和MATH500等推理基准测试中，SSDP相比最先进的树搜索基线实现2.3倍加速，节点探索减少85-90%，准确率保持在最强基线的5%以内。

Conclusion: SSDP为高效、可扩展的LLM推理提供了一种实用方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning boosts the problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) but is computationally expensive due to semantic redundancy, where distinct branches explore equivalent reasoning paths. We introduce Semantic Similarity-Based Dynamic Pruning (SSDP), a lightweight method that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first framework to integrate online semantic merging into parallelized tree search, enabling the clustering and pruning of redundant steps in real time. Across reasoning benchmarks, including GSM8K and MATH500, SSDP achieves up to a 2.3x speedup over state-of-the-art tree-search baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy (typically within 5% of the strongest baseline) and reducing the number of explored nodes by 85-90%, demonstrating a practical approach to efficient, scalable LLM reasoning. The implementation of SSDP is publicly available at https://github.com/kimjoonghokim/SSDP.

Motivation: 幻觉问题严重阻碍了LLMs在高风险领域的实际部署，需要测试模型在对抗性提示下的鲁棒性。

Method: 三步框架：1) 让LLM生成特定领域的真假陈述；2) 让LLM验证这些陈述的真假；3) 测试LLM对自身生成谎言的抵抗力。

Result: 五个主流LLMs在电影和小说两个封闭领域测试显示：Claude最强韧，GPT和Grok中等，Gemini和DeepSeek最弱。

Conclusion: 随着越来越多人使用LLMs进行信息检索，这些发现敲响了警钟，模型对自身生成谎言的抵抗力存在显著差异。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制假设攻击者来自外部，但未充分探索模型自身输出成为新攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 使用模型生成的Mitigated Harmful Query作为新输入，在GPT-3.5-turbo、LLaMA3-8B-instruct和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B上测试Base、Zero-shot和Few-shot条件下的越狱成功率。

Result: Zero-shot条件下最高52%转换成功率和33%越狱成功率，Few-shot条件下最高65%转换成功率和41%越狱成功率。自动评估高估越狱成功率52%。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑防护机制设计并建立更鲁棒的评估方法，自动评估不足以准确判断有害性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准测试无法捕捉动态世界中的知识演变，且集中式管理难以跟上LLMs的快速发展速度。

Method: OKBench是一个代理框架，自动化完成基准测试的获取、创建、验证和分发过程，减少与预训练数据的重叠。

Result: 评估显示不同模型在面对新信息时表现出不同行为，检索缩小了大小模型之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 在演化知识基准上评估LLMs至关重要，OKBench框架实现了基准测试的民主化创建和全面评估。

Abstract: Knowledge-intensive question answering is central to large language models (LLMs) and is typically assessed using static benchmarks derived from sources like Wikipedia and textbooks. However, these benchmarks fail to capture evolving knowledge in a dynamic world, and centralized curation struggles to keep pace with rapid LLM advancements. To address these drawbacks, we propose Open Knowledge Bench (OKBench), a fully automated framework for generating high-quality, dynamic knowledge benchmarks on demand. Focusing on the news domain where knowledge updates daily, OKBench is an agentic framework that automates the sourcing, creation, validation, and distribution of benchmarks. Our approach democratizes benchmark creation and facilitates thorough evaluation of retrieval-augmented methods by reducing overlap with pretraining data. We evaluate our framework on a wide range open-source and proprietary LLMs of various sizes and configurations, both with and without retrieval over freshly generated knowledge. Our results reveal distinct model behaviors when confronted with new information and highlight how retrieval narrows the performance gap between small and large models. These findings underscore the importance of evaluating LLMs on evolving knowledge benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统临床案例创建耗时且依赖专家经验，而通用大语言模型在专业领域容易产生幻觉并需要大量专家修订，需要开发专门针对言语语言病理学领域的自动化案例生成系统。

Method: 构建多模型RAG系统，整合领域知识库和工程化提示模板，测试了五个商业和开源大语言模型，设计了七个涵盖不同障碍类型和年级水平的测试场景，使用多维度评估标准进行自动化质量评估。

Conclusion: 该系统为儿科SLP案例生成提供了可行方案，未来可扩展到临床决策支持、IEP目标自动生成和临床反思训练等应用，但需要进一步专家验证和测试才能用于教育或研究。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

Method: 基于DisCoCirc的语法规则框架，开发孟加拉语的类似形式化方法，应用于英-孟翻译任务，并分析其处理语言结构差异的能力。

Result: 研究发现DisCoCirc虽然对大部分语言有效，但由于两种语言的结构差异，在翻译中仍面临限制，即使处理简单句子也存在困难。

Conclusion: DisCoCirc框架在跨语言翻译中存在约束，与先前声称的效果不符，这突显了改进空间，同时揭示了连词与布尔逻辑之间的联系。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI和大型语言模型在医疗决策支持系统中具有重要作用，需要评估不同LLM在急诊医学诊断中的能力差异，并探索通过集成学习提升诊断准确率的方法。

Method: 使用5个主要LLM（Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT、Claude）处理真实急诊病例，构建MEDAS超级学习系统，采用元学习器整合不同LLM的诊断能力。

Result: 单个LLM诊断准确率在58%-65%之间，超过人类医生报告准确率。超级学习器MEDAS将准确率提升至70%，其中最佳单个LLM可达85%准确率。

Conclusion: 通过元学习方法整合多个LLM的诊断能力，可以显著提升医疗急诊诊断的准确率，超级学习器能够利用不同LLM训练数据集的综合知识优势。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域专业化监督微调中资源消耗大和灾难性遗忘的问题，通过智能数据选择提高效率并保持通用能力。

Method: 设计自引导标准，利用初步训练阶段获得的梯度幅度和统计分布来识别对模型学习贡献最大的训练样本子集。

Result: 在医学、法律、金融等多个领域的实验中，仅使用5%的GrADS选择数据就能超越全数据集微调性能，使用50%数据时性能显著提升，同时大幅缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: GrADS方法能够高效、经济地实现LLMs的领域专业化，在保持通用能力的同时显著提升领域性能，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

Motivation: 自杀是青少年第二大死因，社交媒体中常出现自杀意图信号，需要开发准确检测方法来预防自杀行为。

Method: 使用CNN架构提取局部特征，BiGRU技术进行双向序列建模，结合注意力机制，并应用SHAP进行预测结果解释。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验，准确率达到93.97%，优于现有的机器学习和深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 提出的混合深度学习框架结合可解释性方法，为自杀检测提供了有效的解决方案，在性能和可靠性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了SAGE-Agent，基于结构化不确定性建模工具调用参数，通过POMDP和EVPI优化问题选择，在模糊任务中提高覆盖率7-39%，同时减少澄清问题1.5-2.7倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在工具调用时，模糊的用户指令会导致错误调用和任务失败，需要更有效的不确定性处理和澄清机制

Method: 引入工具调用参数的结构化不确定性建模，将联合工具参数澄清建模为POMDP，使用EVPI目标进行最优问题选择，并采用基于方面的成本建模防止冗余

Result: 在ClarifyBench基准测试中，SAGE-Agent在模糊任务中提高覆盖率7-39%，减少澄清问题1.5-2.7倍；通过不确定性加权GRPO训练，将When2Call准确率从36.5%提升至65.2%（3B模型）和36.7%提升至62.9%（7B模型）

Conclusion: 结构化不确定性为工具增强代理提供了原则性、高效的方法，在现实场景中同时提高了任务成功率和交互效率

Abstract: LLM agents extend large language models with tool-calling capabilities, but ambiguous user instructions often lead to incorrect invocations and task failures. We introduce a principled formulation of structured uncertainty over tool-call parameters, modeling joint tool-argument clarification as a POMDP with Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) objective for optimal question selection and aspect-based cost modeling to prevent redundancy. Our SAGE-Agent leverages this structured uncertainty to achieve superior efficiency: increasing coverage on ambiguous tasks by 7-39\% while reducing clarification questions by 1.5-2.7$\times$ compared to strong prompting and uncertainty-based baselines. We present ClarifyBench, the first multi-turn tool-augmented disambiguation benchmark with realistic LLM-based user simulation across diverse domains including document editing, vehicle control, and travel booking. Additionally, we demonstrate that structured uncertainty provides effective training signals for reinforcement learning, boosting When2Call accuracy from 36.5\% to 65.2\% (3B model) and 36.7\% to 62.9\% (7B model) through uncertainty-weighted GRPO training. These results establish structured uncertainty as a principled, efficient approach for tool-augmented agents, improving both task success and interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 本研究开发并评估了三种NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者自述中自动识别认知过程类别。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct模型表现最佳，在复杂认知类别提取方面优于其他模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验描述，可以为疾病相关的认知和情感变化提供宝贵见解，但从非结构化患者叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 比较了三种模型：基于Bio_ClinicalBERT的嵌套实体识别模型、使用QLoRA微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct指令跟随模型，以及零样本和少样本设置的GPT-4o mini模型，用于提取七个认知类别。

Result: 模型性能在不同类别和模型家族间差异显著。微调的Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct获得最高F1分数（微观平均0.74，宏观平均0.59），在上下文依赖类别（如思维和社交互动）表现优异。Bio_ClinicalBERT精度高但召回率低。

Conclusion: 尽管由于认知过程叙述的抽象和重叠特性，这项任务比传统信息提取更具挑战性，但经过持续改进，这些NLP系统有望实现低负担的纵向认知功能监测，并作为帕金森病正式神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

Motivation: 孟加拉语自然语言推理研究资源极度匮乏，现有数据集存在标注错误、模糊句子对和语言多样性不足等问题，阻碍了有效的模型训练和评估。

Method: 通过强调语义清晰性和在蕴含、矛盾和中性类别间平衡的严格标注流程构建数据集，并使用包括多语言和孟加拉语特定模型在内的最先进transformer架构进行基准测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用BNLI数据集在孟加拉语文本复杂语义关系捕捉方面实现了更高的可靠性和可解释性。

Conclusion: BNLI为推进孟加拉语及其他低资源语言推理任务研究建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统将任务导向对话和闲聊分开开发，但真实对话需要在这两种模式间自然切换，因此需要统一建模方法。

Method: 构建TACT数据集支持用户和代理驱动的模式切换，提出Switch和Recovery评估指标，使用DPO优化训练模型。

Result: TACT训练模型在意图检测和模式切换处理上优于基线，DPO优化后达到75.74%联合模式-意图准确率，在人类评估中对GPT-4o胜率达70.1%。

Conclusion: 结构多样化的数据结合DPO能显著提升对话质量和过渡控制，为更主动和过渡感知的对话代理铺平道路。

Abstract: Conversational agents have traditionally been developed for either task-oriented dialogue (TOD) or open-ended chitchat, with limited progress in unifying the two. Yet, real-world conversations naturally involve fluid transitions between these modes. To address this gap, we introduce TACT (TOD-And-Chitchat Transition), a dataset designed for transition-aware dialogue modeling that incorporates structurally diverse and integrated mode flows. TACT supports both user- and agent-driven mode switches, enabling robust modeling of complex conversational dynamics. To evaluate an agent's ability to initiate and recover from mode transitions, we propose two new metrics -- Switch and Recovery. Models trained on TACT outperform baselines in both intent detection and mode transition handling. Moreover, applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to TACT-trained models yields additional gains, achieving 75.74\% joint mode-intent accuracy and a 70.1\% win rate against GPT-4o in human evaluation. These results demonstrate that pairing structurally diverse data with DPO enhances response quality and transition control, paving the way for more proactive and transition-aware conversational agents.

Motivation: 传统生物医学假设生成方法依赖单一数据类型或预定义提取模式，限制了发现新颖复杂关系的能力。LLM智能体在信息检索、推理和生成方面具有潜力，但缺乏标准化数据集和执行环境。

Method: 提出BioVerge基准测试和BioVerge Agent框架，使用基于ReAct的方法，包含独立的生成和评估模块，迭代产生和自评估假设提案，结合历史生物医学假设和PubMed文献的结构化和文本数据。

Conclusion: BioVerge为生物医学假设生成创建了标准化环境，证明了LLM智能体在该领域的潜力，特别是自评估机制对提升假设质量的重要性。

Abstract: Hypothesis generation in biomedical research has traditionally centered on uncovering hidden relationships within vast scientific literature, often using methods like Literature-Based Discovery (LBD). Despite progress, current approaches typically depend on single data types or predefined extraction patterns, which restricts the discovery of novel and complex connections. Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents show significant potential, with capabilities in information retrieval, reasoning, and generation. However, their application to biomedical hypothesis generation has been limited by the absence of standardized datasets and execution environments. To address this, we introduce BioVerge, a comprehensive benchmark, and BioVerge Agent, an LLM-based agent framework, to create a standardized environment for exploring biomedical hypothesis generation at the frontier of existing scientific knowledge. Our dataset includes structured and textual data derived from historical biomedical hypotheses and PubMed literature, organized to support exploration by LLM agents. BioVerge Agent utilizes a ReAct-based approach with distinct Generation and Evaluation modules that iteratively produce and self-assess hypothesis proposals. Through extensive experimentation, we uncover key insights: 1) different architectures of BioVerge Agent influence exploration diversity and reasoning strategies; 2) structured and textual information sources each provide unique, critical contexts that enhance hypothesis generation; and 3) self-evaluation significantly improves the novelty and relevance of proposed hypotheses.

TL;DR: LLM生成参考文献时，引用次数高的论文幻觉率更低，超过1000次引用的论文几乎被逐字记忆，引用次数与事实准确性强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在文献推荐中产生不存在论文的幻觉问题，研究引用次数如何影响LLM输出中的幻觉参考文献。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的引用，通过余弦相似度测量生成与真实元数据的事实一致性，将引用次数作为训练数据冗余的代理指标。

Result: 引用次数与事实准确性强相关；超过约1000次引用的文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；多个高引用论文内容相似时会出现记忆干扰。

Conclusion: 存在一个从泛化转向记忆的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中，引用频率是预测LLM引用准确性的重要指标。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散语言模型并行生成优势与自回归模型质量优势之间的平衡问题，现有方法要么牺牲质量追求效率，要么牺牲效率追求质量。

Method: 使用结构化注意力掩码，在单次前向传播中同时进行扩散草稿生成和自回归采样，充分利用GPU计算密度。

Result: 在1.5B和8B规模上，TiDAR在吞吐量上超越推测解码，在效率和质量上超越Dream和Llada等扩散模型，首次在保持AR模型质量的同时实现4.71-5.91倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: TiDAR成功实现了自回归模型质量与扩散模型吞吐量的协同，是首个在保持AR级别质量的同时显著提升生成效率的架构。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然语言推理等任务中，人类标注变异性使得难以区分标注错误与合理变体。现有VARIERR框架需要两轮人工标注，成本高昂且覆盖范围有限。

Method: 提出EVADE框架：使用大语言模型生成解释并验证标注错误，通过分布比较、验证重叠和微调影响三个维度全面分析人工与LLM检测的差异。

Result: LLM验证使生成的解释分布更接近人工标注，从训练数据中移除LLM检测的错误比移除人工检测的错误能带来更大的微调性能提升。

Conclusion: LLM能够扩展错误检测规模，在减少人工努力的同时提高标签变异性下的数据集质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Motivation: 现有潜在推理方法缺乏确保潜在表示稳定演化的机制，也没有系统性地交织隐式和显式推理的方法。

Method: 引入SpiralThinker框架，执行潜在表示的迭代更新，实现无需生成额外token的扩展隐式推理。结合渐进对齐目标和结构化注释来维持潜在与文本推理之间的一致性。

Result: 在数学、逻辑和常识推理任务中，SpiralThinker在潜在推理方法中取得最佳整体性能，在所有基准测试中持续超越先前方法。

Conclusion: SpiralThinker桥接了迭代计算和潜在推理，证明对齐的迭代更新可以可靠地在潜在空间中引导推理过程。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于轨迹的情感支持评估框架，从静态对话评估转向动态长期评估，通过模拟328个情感情境和1152个干扰事件来评估LLMs在长期情感支持中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型情感支持评估多基于短对话和静态场景，无法捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性特点，需要更贴近真实交互的评估方法。

Method: 构建大规模基准数据集，采用用户中心视角，将用户情感轨迹建模为一阶马尔可夫过程，使用经过验证的情绪调节策略约束模型输出，并应用因果调整的情感估计方法。

Result: 通过三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）对多种LLMs进行评估，发现不同模型在情感支持能力上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架能够全面评估LLMs的长期情感支持性能，为模型开发提供了可操作的见解，证明了轨迹评估方法在情感支持领域的重要性。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言理解方面表现出色，但其固有的随机性限制了在金融、医疗等严格监管行业中的应用，这些行业需要遵循严格的政策要求。

Method: 两阶段神经符号框架：第一阶段使用LLM（可选人工指导）将自然语言政策形式化；第二阶段通过推理时自动形式化验证自然语言陈述的逻辑正确性，并在需要时进行多重冗余形式化步骤进行交叉验证。

Result: 基准测试显示该方法超过99%的可靠性，表明在识别逻辑有效性方面接近零假阳性率。

Conclusion: 该方法产生可审计的逻辑工件，能够验证结果并用于改进原始文本，为严格监管行业提供了可靠的政策合规检查解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Method: 采用混合CTC/Attention架构，结合上下文感知动态分块机制，根据编码状态自适应调整块宽度，并构建基于藏语正字法原则的词典，集成外部语言模型进行解码。

Result: 在测试集上达到6.23%的词错误率，相比固定分块基线相对提升48.15%，显著降低识别延迟，性能接近全局解码。

Conclusion: 提出的动态分块框架有效解决了流式语音识别中的上下文截断问题，在安多藏语识别任务中取得了显著性能提升，同时保持了较低的延迟。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，Bi-RAR超越了先前的方法，并在训练和推理过程中实现了与搜索引擎的高效交互和推理

Conclusion: Bi-RAR通过双向评估中间推理步骤，显著提升了检索增强生成在复杂多步推理任务中的性能

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过日本即兴喜剧游戏Oogiri系统评估大语言模型的幽默能力，发现LLMs在生成幽默回应时缺乏共情能力，且评估标准与人类存在根本差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要依赖单维度评估LLMs的幽默能力（如是否"有趣"），但幽默需要多维度理解。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过Oogiri游戏对LLMs进行系统评估。

Method: 扩展现有Oogiri数据集，加入LLMs生成的回应，并手动标注六个维度的5分绝对评分：新颖性、清晰度、相关性、智能性、共情性和整体趣味性。评估LLMs在生成创意回应和六维度评估两个核心任务上的能力。

Result: LLMs生成的回应水平介于人类低阶和中阶表现之间，但显著缺乏共情能力。相关分析显示LLMs与人类评估标准存在根本分歧：LLMs优先考虑新颖性，而人类优先考虑共情性。

Conclusion: LLMs在幽默生成和评估方面存在共情缺陷，这解释了它们无法复制人类幽默评估的原因。发布标注语料库以促进更情感智能的对话代理开发。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

Motivation: RoPE位置编码存在限制，削弱了长度外推能力。研究发现注意力图可视为带噪声的特征图，需要去除其中的异常频率成分。

Method: 基于截断矩阵熵检测特征图中的异常频率带，利用噪声特性通过无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图，实现鲁棒外推。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的去噪策略有效缓解注意力下沉，恢复平衡的注意力模式，为改善长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Conclusion: 闭环自精化数据管道可以显著增强LLM的工具使用能力，且在成本效益高的开源生态系统中运行，消除了对昂贵闭源API的依赖。

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

Motivation: 大语言模型在表格问答中直接输入整个表格作为长文本会导致错误答案，因为大多数LLM无法捕捉复杂的表格结构。

Method: 使用语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制计算问题与单元格的相似度来估计表头，通过对比学习在小数据集上训练语言模型，在最相关行列的交集处选择答案。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了表格问答的准确性，未来计划整合更高效的文本搜索模型来进一步提高性能并缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Motivation: 针对之前提出的sequentiality度量方法存在的主题选择混淆问题和缺乏真实流度验证的批评，本研究旨在实证验证仅使用上下文术语作为更概念有效和可解释的替代方案。

Method: 使用两个带有人工标注特征分数的作文数据集（ASAP++和ELLIPSE），比较上下文版sequentiality与人类对语篇层面特征（如组织性和连贯性）评估的一致性，并与零样本LLM预测和标准语言特征组合进行对比。

Result: 上下文版sequentiality与人类对组织性和连贯性的评估更一致；虽然零样本LLM预测特征分数更准确，但上下文度量与标准语言特征组合时比仅主题版和原版sequentiality增加更多预测价值，且优于零样本LLM预测。

Conclusion: 支持使用基于上下文的sequentiality作为经过验证、可解释且互补的特征，用于自动作文评分和相关NLP任务，突显了显式建模句子间流程的价值。

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型(SSLM)框架，支持预训练和微调，在三种形态类型不同的语言(isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语)上进行训练分析。

Result: 识别出四个子词学习阶段，形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大不稳定性；微调时子词边界变得更细粒度；可学习子词能改善低资源复杂形态语言的文本生成和跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 可学习子词分割为低资源复杂形态语言提供了有前景的改进方法，子词学习动态具有语言学意义。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

TL;DR: 本文提出Anchor方法，通过将真实轨迹注入rollouts来稳定强化学习训练，解决诚实对齐中因早期负奖励主导导致的模型崩溃问题，显著提升语言模型的演绎推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法仅优化最终任务结果，在早期训练中负奖励主导时容易导致模型崩溃，这在诚实对齐任务中尤为突出，因为模型不仅要解决可回答的查询，还要识别何时无法从给定前提得出结论。

Method: 提出Anchor方法：在rollouts中注入真实轨迹来稳定强化学习训练；构建两个基于图结构的多步演绎推理数据集（线性代数和逻辑推理），其中一半实例通过随机扰动边来创建不可回答的情况。

Result: 实验表明GRPO方法（无论是否使用监督微调初始化）在这些任务上表现不佳；课程学习有一定帮助但需要精心设计的同分布数据集；Anchor方法能稳定学习并显著提升整体推理性能。

Conclusion: 训练动态对于实现对齐语言模型中可靠的演绎推理至关重要，Anchor方法通过防止早期训练崩溃有效解决了诚实对齐的挑战。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

TL;DR: POTSA是一个基于跨语言平行语音对和最优传输的新框架，旨在弥合高资源和低资源语言之间的翻译差距，通过偏置补偿和细粒度表示对齐提升多语言语音翻译性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中往往忽略跨源语言的语义共性，导致翻译性能存在偏差，特别是在高资源和低资源语言之间。

Method: 提出POTSA框架：1）偏置补偿模块粗粒度对齐初始语音表示；2）在Q-Former上施加token级最优传输约束建立细粒度表示一致性；3）采用层级调度策略将OT约束聚焦于语义最有益的层。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上，该方法在5种常见语言上平均提升+0.93 BLEU，在零样本语言上提升+5.05 BLEU，每个源语言仅使用10小时平行语音数据。

Conclusion: POTSA通过跨语言表示对齐有效提升了多语言语音翻译性能，特别是在低资源语言上表现显著，证明了最优传输在弥合语言资源差距方面的有效性。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: C³TG是一个用于细粒度多维度文本属性控制的两阶段框架，通过选择性配对属性分类器和加权KL散度调整生成概率，再通过能量函数迭代优化解决属性冲突，无需模型修改即可实现精确的多属性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以精确控制多个文本属性，特别是在属性要求冲突时缺乏协调机制，且无法在控制生成流程中纳入迭代优化过程。

Method: 提出C³TG两阶段框架：生成阶段选择性配对LLM与17个可用维度属性分类器，使用加权KL散度调整token概率；优化阶段利用结合分类器得分和惩罚项的能量函数，通过迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明C³TG在多个指标上显著优于基线方法，包括属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性，同时降低了毒性。

Conclusion: C³TG是一个无需昂贵模型修改的有效灵活的多维文本属性控制解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在创意写作任务中需要适应用户的个人偏好，但现有训练数据集往往将不同个人品味视为整体，缺乏个性化建模。

Method: 构建LiteraryTaste数据集，包含60人的阅读习惯陈述偏好和100对创意写作文本的揭示偏好标注；使用transformer编码器进行微调建模；采用LLM驱动的可解释性管道分析偏好变化。

Result: 1) 人们在创意写作偏好上存在显著差异；2) 微调transformer编码器在建模个人和集体揭示偏好时分别达到75.8%和67.7%的准确率；3) 陈述偏好对建模揭示偏好的效用有限。

Conclusion: 该工作为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础，证明了通过数据驱动方法可以有效建模个人写作偏好。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Conclusion: 成功开发了可解释的高棉语极性分类器，并贡献了新的高棉语极性数据集和微调模型。

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定删除率处理变长序列时性能不佳，需要能够根据输入特性动态调整的删除机制。

Method: 引入了AdaptDel方法，使用可适应的删除率，并将随机平滑理论框架扩展到可变率删除，确保编辑距离下的可靠认证。

Result: 在自然语言任务中取得了显著的实证结果，认证区域的中值基数比最先进方法提高了高达30个数量级。

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率有效解决了变长序列分类的认证鲁棒性问题，在编辑距离扰动下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

TL;DR: 提出了mmJEE-Eval多模态双语基准，基于印度JEE Advanced考试题目，评估视觉语言模型的科学推理能力，发现前沿闭源模型表现优异但开源模型表现较差，且模型在元认知推理任务上表现崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理基准无法充分区分真正的科学推理能力与模式匹配，需要更严格的基准来评估模型的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,460道JEE Advanced考试题目的多模态双语基准，涵盖物理、化学和数学领域，评估17个最先进模型在标准推理和元认知推理任务上的表现。

Result: 前沿闭源VLMs在2025年题目上达到77-84%准确率，开源模型仅37-45%准确率；在元认知推理任务中，GPT-5仅修复5.2%的错误。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval基准能够有效区分不同训练和推理方法的质量，其难度源于复杂性和推理深度而非记忆，为评估科学推理能力提供了更严格的测试标准。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时缩放能提升大语言模型推理性能但计算成本高，现有动态自一致性方法受限于顺序请求的高延迟。

Method: 利用快速系统1计算答案熵评估样本缩放潜力，在系统2下实现动态自一致性，通过并行生成降低延迟。

Result: 相比现有方法，令牌消耗减少47%，推理延迟降低43%，且无显著性能损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC通过系统1和系统2的协同工作，有效解决了测试时缩放中的效率和延迟问题。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

TL;DR: 提出了Spider4SSC数据集和S2CLite解析工具，S2CLite是一个轻量级、本体无关的解析器，可将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询，在Spider4SPARQL数据集上达到77.8%的解析准确率，优于现有最佳方法S2CTrans的44.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SPARQL到Cypher的转换解决方案存在依赖RDF图或外部工具的问题，需要开发一种轻量级、规则驱动的解析器来改进转换准确性和效率。

Method: S2CLite采用纯基于规则的方法（受传统编程语言编译器启发），无需RDF图或外部工具，直接将SPARQL查询转换为Cypher查询。

Result: 在BSBM42和Spider4SPARQL数据集上的实验显示，S2CLite显著减少了解析错误，在Spider4SPARQL上达到77.8%的解析准确率，比S2CTrans提高33.6%；在执行准确率上达到96.6%，优于S2CTrans 7.3%。

Conclusion: S2CLite是一个高效、准确的SPARQL到Cypher转换工具，同时生成的Spider4SSC数据集为文本到查询语言研究提供了统一的多语言基准数据集。

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher). We open-source S2CLite for further development on GitHub (github.com/vejvarm/S2CLite) and provide the clean Spider4SSC dataset for download.

Conclusion: MTQ-Eval框架有效地扩展了大语言模型在多语言文本质量评估方面的能力，并带来了下游任务的改进。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

Motivation: 当前离线偏好优化方法在排序准确性上存在局限，主要问题是过拟合-欠拟合困境：对正确排序样本施加过多梯度（过拟合），对错误排序样本提供不足纠正信号（欠拟合）。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，采用实例级自适应边距，通过Z归一化和指数缩放动态重新分配学习努力，放大错误排序样本的梯度并抑制正确排序样本的梯度。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，AMaPO实现了更好的排序准确性和更优的下游对齐性能，同时成功缓解了核心的过拟合和欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边距设计有效解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合-欠拟合困境，为语言模型对齐提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Result: 微调模型在命名实体识别和关系抽取任务上表现显著优于LLM（NER: 80.6% vs 44.4%，RE: 54.0% vs 10.1%）。

Conclusion: 监督模型在信息提取任务上明显优于无监督的LLM方法，表明需要像GSAP-ERE这样的数据集来推进学术信息提取领域的研究。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

TL;DR: 提出TPoT方法，通过语义筛选文本输入深度学习模型来预测大五人格特质，解决了大语言模型输入限制问题并提升了预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从大量生成文本中预测个体人格特质具有挑战性，特别是当文本量很大时，需要解决输入文本限制问题

Method: 使用TPoT策略语义过滤文本，构建BIG5-TPoT模型，选择与特定人格特质、方面或项目语义相关的文本作为输入

Result: 在Stream of Consciousness Essays数据集上，该方法改善了平均绝对误差和准确率指标

Conclusion: TPoT是一种简单有效的策略，通过语义相关文本选择能够更好地预测大五人格特质

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

*Rémi Cardon,A. Seza Doğruöz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了自动文本简化(ATS)中可读性度量与自动评估指标及人工判断的相关性，发现在英语中这三者之间的相关性普遍较低，需要明确定义ATS的构建概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动文本简化研究中，可读性度量与自动评估指标和人工判断之间的相关性尚未得到足够关注，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 首先讨论ATS与可读性研究的关系，然后进行可读性度量与人工判断、可读性度量与ATS评估指标之间相关性的研究。

Result: 研究发现，可读性度量与自动指标和人工判断的相关性普遍较差，三个评估角度之间的相关性较低。

Conclusion: 由于ATS的三个不同评估角度之间相关性较低，需要明确定义ATS的构建概念。

Abstract: Readability is a key concept in the current era of abundant written information. To help making texts more readable and make information more accessible to everyone, a line of researched aims at making texts accessible for their target audience: automatic text simplification (ATS). Lately, there have been studies on the correlations between automatic evaluation metrics in ATS and human judgment. However, the correlations between those two aspects and commonly available readability measures (such as readability formulas or linguistic features) have not been the focus of as much attention. In this work, we investigate the place of readability measures in ATS by complementing the existing studies on evaluation metrics and human judgment, on English. We first discuss the relationship between ATS and research in readability, then we report a study on correlations between readability measures and human judgment, and between readability measures and ATS evaluation metrics. We identify that in general, readability measures do not correlate well with automatic metrics and human judgment. We argue that as the three different angles from which simplification can be assessed tend to exhibit rather low correlations with one another, there is a need for a clear definition of the construct in ATS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SynClaimEval框架评估合成数据在长上下文声明验证任务中的效用，通过三个维度分析：输入特征、合成逻辑和解释质量。实验表明长上下文合成能提升基础指令调优模型的验证性能，特别是在增强现有人工编写数据集时，还能提高解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建用于训练和评估长文档推理的标注资源成本高昂，合成数据提供了可扩展的替代方案，需要评估其在长上下文声明验证任务中的有效性。

Method: 引入SynClaimEval框架，从三个维度评估合成数据：输入特征（上下文长度变化和跨域泛化）、合成逻辑（声明复杂度和错误类型控制）、解释质量（模型解释与预测的一致性）。

Result: 实验表明长上下文合成能改善基础指令调优模型的验证性能，特别是在增强现有人工数据集时效果更佳。合成还能提高解释质量，即使验证分数没有提升。

Conclusion: 合成数据不仅能提升长上下文声明验证的性能，还能增强模型的可解释性，为幻觉检测和事实核查任务提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with extended context windows promise direct reasoning over long documents, reducing the need for chunking or retrieval. Constructing annotated resources for training and evaluation, however, remains costly. Synthetic data offers a scalable alternative, and we introduce SynClaimEval, a framework for evaluating synthetic data utility in long-context claim verification -- a task central to hallucination detection and fact-checking. Our framework examines three dimensions: (i) input characteristics, by varying context length and testing generalization to out-of-domain benchmarks; (ii) synthesis logic, by controlling claim complexity and error type variation; and (iii) explanation quality, measuring the degree to which model explanations provide evidence consistent with predictions. Experiments across benchmarks show that long-context synthesis can improve verification in base instruction-tuned models, particularly when augmenting existing human-written datasets. Moreover, synthesis enhances explanation quality, even when verification scores do not improve, underscoring its potential to strengthen both performance and explainability.

### [126] [Bridging Natural Language and ASP: A Hybrid Approach Using LLMs and AMR Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08715)
*Connar Hite,Sean Saud,Raef Taha,Nayim Rahman,Tanvir Atahary,Scott Douglass,Tarek Taha*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用LLM和AMR图将英语翻译成ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，减少对LLM的依赖，创建轻量级可解释系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASP是强大的组合问题解决工具，但需要学习语法。随着非程序员需要与代码交互的需求增加，需要更易用的自然语言到ASP的转换方法。

Method: 使用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，然后通过AMR图解析简化语言并系统生成ASP约束，最终创建完整的ASP程序。

Result: 系统成功创建了能够解决组合逻辑问题的完整ASP程序，展示了在示例逻辑谜题上的能力。

Conclusion: 这是创建轻量级、可解释的自然语言到复杂逻辑问题解决系统的重大第一步，显著减少了传统方法对LLM的完全依赖。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI是人类轻松解决但对AI系统极具挑战的流体智力基准测试，受神经科学和心理学中人类智能建模方法的启发，旨在开发认知合理的解决方案。

Method: 使用神经符号方法，基于向量符号代数(VSA)集成系统1直觉和系统2推理，通过以对象为中心的程序合成，利用VSA表示抽象对象、指导解决方案搜索并实现样本高效的神经学习。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-1-Train上得分10.8%，在ARC-AGI-1-Eval上得分3.0%；在简单基准测试中表现优异，Sort-of-ARC得分94.5%，1D-ARC得分83.1%（优于GPT-4且计算成本极低）。

Conclusion: 这是首个将VSA应用于ARC-AGI的方法，开发了迄今为止最认知合理的ARC-AGI求解器，为人工智能的抽象推理能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet. Our code is available at: https://github.com/ijoffe/ARC-VSA-2025.

*Mehrdad Zakershahrak*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QDIN是一个将强化学习系统设计为可查询推理引擎的统一架构，通过专门化的神经网络模块处理不同类型的查询（策略、可达性、路径、比较等），实现了推理准确性与控制性能的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统强化学习单一目标优化的范式，探索将RL系统构建为能够回答环境多样性查询的推理引擎，充分利用训练后智能体隐含的环境知识。

Method: 提出查询条件确定性推理网络（QDIN），为不同类型的推理模式设计专门的神经模块，将查询作为一等公民处理。

Result: 推理准确性可达近乎完美水平（99%可达性IoU），即使控制性能仍处于次优状态（31%回报），表明世界知识表示与最优控制所需表示存在根本性解耦。

Conclusion: 建立了将RL系统从设计之初就构建为可查询知识库的研究议程，对可解释性、验证和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on a singular objective: learning policies that select actions to maximize reward. We challenge this paradigm by asking: what if we explicitly architected RL systems as inference engines that can answer diverse queries about their environment? In deterministic settings, trained agents implicitly encode rich knowledge about reachability, distances, values, and dynamics - yet current architectures are not designed to expose this information efficiently. We introduce Query Conditioned Deterministic Inference Networks (QDIN), a unified architecture that treats different types of queries (policy, reachability, paths, comparisons) as first-class citizens, with specialized neural modules optimized for each inference pattern. Our key empirical finding reveals a fundamental decoupling: inference accuracy can reach near-perfect levels (99% reachability IoU) even when control performance remains suboptimal (31% return), suggesting that the representations needed for accurate world knowledge differ from those required for optimal control. Experiments demonstrate that query specialized architectures outperform both unified models and post-hoc extraction methods, while maintaining competitive control performance. This work establishes a research agenda for RL systems designed from inception as queryable knowledge bases, with implications for interpretability, verification, and human-AI collaboration.

### [129] [Neural Value Iteration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08825)
*Yang You,Ufuk Çakır,Alex Schutz,Robert Skilton,Nick Hawes*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的POMDP规划算法——神经价值迭代，通过神经网络表示价值函数，解决了传统方法在大规模POMDP问题中的计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于α向量的POMDP求解器在大规模问题中计算成本过高，因为每个α向量都是|S|维的，贝尔曼备份操作变得难以处理。

Method: 利用PWLC特性，将POMDP价值函数表示为有限个神经网络的集合，结合神经网络的泛化能力和经典价值迭代框架，提出神经价值迭代算法。

Result: 该方法在现有离线求解器无法处理的大规模POMDP中仍能获得接近最优的解。

Conclusion: 神经网络表示为大规模POMDP规划提供了可行的替代方案，结合了神经网络的泛化优势和价值迭代的理论框架。

Abstract: The value function of a POMDP exhibits the piecewise-linear-convex (PWLC) property and can be represented as a finite set of hyperplanes, known as $α$-vectors. Most state-of-the-art POMDP solvers (offline planners) follow the point-based value iteration scheme, which performs Bellman backups on $α$-vectors at reachable belief points until convergence. However, since each $α$-vector is $|S|$-dimensional, these methods quickly become intractable for large-scale problems due to the prohibitive computational cost of Bellman backups. In this work, we demonstrate that the PWLC property allows a POMDP's value function to be alternatively represented as a finite set of neural networks. This insight enables a novel POMDP planning algorithm called \emph{Neural Value Iteration}, which combines the generalization capability of neural networks with the classical value iteration framework. Our approach achieves near-optimal solutions even in extremely large POMDPs that are intractable for existing offline solvers.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了单向认知优化（UCO）方法，通过多轮交互强化学习解决LLM作为智能导师时的两个关键挑战：无法区分学生是否真正理解，以及无法感知学生认知状态的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在教育中从答案提供者转向智能导师，但现有方法只能学习表面教学模式，缺乏动态适应能力。强化学习方法存在两个关键问题：无法区分学生是否真正理解，以及无法感知学生认知状态的变化。

Method: UCO方法采用多轮交互强化学习范式，包含两个协同的奖励函数：进展奖励捕捉学生认知进步，评估学生是否从困惑转向理解；支架奖励动态识别每个学生的最近发展区，鼓励教师在该区域内保持有效教学。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO模型优于所有同等规模的基线模型，性能与先进闭源模型相当。

Conclusion: UCO方法通过认知导向的奖励机制有效解决了LLM作为智能导师时的关键挑战，实现了更好的教学适应性和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

TL;DR: Lumine是首个能够在3D开放世界中实时完成数小时复杂任务的通用智能体，采用端到端的视觉语言模型统一感知、推理和行动，在Genshin Impact中训练后能完成5小时主线剧情，并具备零样本跨游戏泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 开发能够在复杂3D开放世界环境中实时完成长时间任务的通用智能体，解决现有方法在长时间任务执行和跨环境泛化方面的局限性。

Method: 采用类似人类的交互范式，基于视觉语言模型端到端处理原始像素（5Hz）并产生精确的键盘鼠标动作（30Hz），仅在必要时进行推理。在Genshin Impact中训练。

Result: 成功完成Genshin Impact中5小时Mondstadt主线剧情，效率达到人类水平；在Wuthering Waves中完成100分钟任务，在Honkai: Star Rail中完成5小时第一章，均无需微调。

Conclusion: Lumine在开放世界探索和跨游戏泛化方面表现出色，标志着通用智能体在开放环境中的实质性进展。

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生物声学AI系统虽然表现出色，但忽视了AI递归认知与物种递归通信相遇时的根本问题，即AI可能系统性地模糊或扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Method: 基于哲学家Yuk Hui关于递归性和偶然性的工作，分析AI系统作为递归认知代理的特性，提出双重偶然性问题框架。

Result: 揭示了AI系统不是中立的模式检测器，而是具有自身偶然性的递归认知代理，其信息处理可能扭曲其他物种的通信结构。

Conclusion: 需要将生物声学AI从通用模式识别重新概念化为不同递归认知形式之间的外交相遇，这对模型设计、评估框架和研究方法都有重要影响。

Abstract: Current bioacoustic AI systems achieve impressive cross-species performance by processing animal communication through transformer architectures, foundation model paradigms, and other computational approaches. However, these approaches overlook a fundamental question: what happens when one form of recursive cognition--AI systems with their attention mechanisms, iterative processing, and feedback loops--encounters the recursive communicative processes of other species? Drawing on philosopher Yuk Hui's work on recursivity and contingency, I argue that AI systems are not neutral pattern detectors but recursive cognitive agents whose own information processing may systematically obscure or distort other species' communicative structures. This creates a double contingency problem: each species' communication emerges through contingent ecological and evolutionary conditions, while AI systems process these signals through their own contingent architectural and training conditions. I propose that addressing this challenge requires reconceptualizing bioacoustic AI from universal pattern recognition toward diplomatic encounter between different forms of recursive cognition, with implications for model design, evaluation frameworks, and research methodologies.

TL;DR: AlphaCast是一个结合人类智慧与大语言模型智能的协同推理框架，将时间序列预测重新定义为交互式过程，通过准备、生成和验证三个阶段实现逐步协作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法缺乏人类专家的交互、推理和适应性，限制了在复杂现实环境中的实用性。

Method: 框架包含两个阶段：自动预测准备（构建多源认知基础）和生成推理与反思优化（集成统计特征、先验知识、上下文信息和预测策略，触发元推理循环）。

Result: 在短期和长期数据集上的广泛实验表明，AlphaCast在预测准确性方面持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人类智慧与LLM智能的协同推理，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于图神经网络（GNN）的方法来近似计算ABA框架中的可信接受问题，通过依赖图表示和两种GNN架构（ABAGCN和ABAGAT）实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于假设的论证（ABA）是强大的结构化论证形式，但在稳定语义下精确计算扩展对于大型框架是难处理的，需要开发近似方法。

Method: 将ABA框架建模为依赖图，编码假设、声明和规则作为节点，使用异构边标签区分支持、推导和攻击关系。提出ABAGCN和ABAGAT两种GNN架构，分别使用残差异构卷积层和注意力层学习节点嵌入。

Result: 在ICCMA 2023基准测试中，ABAGCN和ABAGAT优于最先进的GNN基线，节点级F1得分最高达0.71。扩展重构算法在小ABA框架上F1超过0.85，在大型框架上保持约0.58。

Conclusion: 这项工作为结构化论证中的可扩展近似推理开辟了新途径，证明了GNN在复杂论证框架中的有效性。

Abstract: Assumption-Based Argumentation (ABA) is a powerful structured argumentation formalism, but exact computation of extensions under stable semantics is intractable for large frameworks. We present the first Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to approximate credulous acceptance in ABA. To leverage GNNs, we model ABA frameworks via a dependency graph representation encoding assumptions, claims and rules as nodes, with heterogeneous edge labels distinguishing support, derive and attack relations. We propose two GNN architectures - ABAGCN and ABAGAT - that stack residual heterogeneous convolution or attention layers, respectively, to learn node embeddings. Our models are trained on the ICCMA 2023 benchmark, augmented with synthetic ABAFs, with hyperparameters optimised via Bayesian search. Empirically, both ABAGCN and ABAGAT outperform a state-of-the-art GNN baseline that we adapt from the abstract argumentation literature, achieving a node-level F1 score of up to 0.71 on the ICCMA instances. Finally, we develop a sound polynomial time extension-reconstruction algorithm driven by our predictor: it reconstructs stable extensions with F1 above 0.85 on small ABAFs and maintains an F1 of about 0.58 on large frameworks. Our work opens new avenues for scalable approximate reasoning in structured argumentation.

Conclusion: 递归精炼是通过GIS搜索增强LLM推理的强大架构特征，高质量推理是受控的增量搜索过程。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

TL;DR: MAKER系统首次成功实现了超过100万步的LLM任务执行且零错误，通过极端任务分解和微代理机制解决了LLM在长程任务中的扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理和工具使用方面取得突破，但在执行类似人类组织和社会规模的扩展过程时存在持续错误率问题，无法实现长程任务的可靠执行。

Method: 采用极端任务分解策略，将任务分解为可由专注微代理处理的子任务，通过高效的多代理投票方案在每一步进行错误校正。

Result: 成功解决了超过100万步的LLM任务且零错误，理论上可扩展到更高级别。

Conclusion: 大规模分解代理过程（MDAPs）可能比持续改进当前LLMs更有效地解决组织和社会级别的问题。

Abstract: LLMs have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning, insights, and tool use, but chaining these abilities into extended processes at the scale of those routinely executed by humans, organizations, and societies has remained out of reach. The models have a persistent error rate that prevents scale-up: for instance, recent experiments in the Towers of Hanoi benchmark domain showed that the process inevitably becomes derailed after at most a few hundred steps. Thus, although LLM research is often still benchmarked on tasks with relatively few dependent logical steps, there is increasing attention on the ability (or inability) of LLMs to perform long range tasks. This paper describes MAKER, the first system that successfully solves a task with over one million LLM steps with zero errors, and, in principle, scales far beyond this level. The approach relies on an extreme decomposition of a task into subtasks, each of which can be tackled by focused microagents. The high level of modularity resulting from the decomposition allows error correction to be applied at each step through an efficient multi-agent voting scheme. This combination of extreme decomposition and error correction makes scaling possible. Thus, the results suggest that instead of relying on continual improvement of current LLMs, massively decomposed agentic processes (MDAPs) may provide a way to efficiently solve problems at the level of organizations and societies.

Conclusion: Argus能有效高效地增强ADS的韧性，显著改善驾驶性能并预防安全违规

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

TL;DR: OR-R1是一个数据高效的自动化优化建模与求解框架，通过监督微调和测试时组相对策略优化两阶段训练，仅使用1/10的数据量就达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学优化建模需要高度专业知识，现有基于大语言模型的方法需要大量标注或合成数据，成本高且可扩展性差。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1) 监督微调从有限标注数据学习问题建模和代码生成；2) 测试时组相对策略优化利用无标签数据提升能力和一致性。

Result: 平均求解准确率达67.7%，仅用ORLM所需1/10的合成数据，准确率提升达4.2%。TGRPO带来额外3.1%-6.4%的准确率提升，Pass@1与Pass@8性能差距从13%缩小到7%。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化运筹学优化问题建模与求解提供了鲁棒、可扩展且成本效益高的解决方案，降低了工业应用的专业知识和数据壁垒。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在显式推理中表现出弱短期记忆，将链式交互视为离散屏幕理解，缺乏对情景中历史交互的感知，这限制了GUI自动化的性能。

Method: 提出HAR框架，包含构建反思学习场景、合成定制纠正指南和设计混合RL奖励函数，开发了HAR-GUI-3B模型，将推理模式从历史无关转变为历史感知。

Result: 在多个GUI相关基准测试中的综合评估证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAR框架成功增强了GUI代理的短期记忆能力和屏幕细节感知，提升了长时程GUI任务的执行性能。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have significantly enhanced Graphical User Interface (GUI) automation. Equipping GUI agents with reliable episodic reasoning capabilities is essential for bridging the gap between users' concise task descriptions and the complexities of real-world execution. Current methods integrate Reinforcement Learning (RL) with System-2 Chain-of-Thought, yielding notable gains in reasoning enhancement. For long-horizon GUI tasks, historical interactions connect each screen to the goal-oriented episode chain, and effectively leveraging these clues is crucial for the current decision. However, existing native GUI agents exhibit weak short-term memory in their explicit reasoning, interpreting the chained interactions as discrete screen understanding, i.e., unawareness of the historical interactions within the episode. This history-agnostic reasoning challenges their performance in GUI automation. To alleviate this weakness, we propose a History-Aware Reasoning (HAR) framework, which encourages an agent to reflect on its own errors and acquire episodic reasoning knowledge from them via tailored strategies that enhance short-term memory in long-horizon interaction. The framework mainly comprises constructing a reflective learning scenario, synthesizing tailored correction guidelines, and designing a hybrid RL reward function. Using the HAR framework, we develop a native end-to-end model, HAR-GUI-3B, which alters the inherent reasoning mode from history-agnostic to history-aware, equipping the GUI agent with stable short-term memory and reliable perception of screen details. Comprehensive evaluations across a range of GUI-related benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our method.

Conclusion: 详细的错误分析揭示了几个普遍问题，为未来的改进指明了具体方向。

Abstract: With the deep integration of artificial intelligence and interactive technology, Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agent, as the carrier connecting goal-oriented natural language and real-world devices, has received widespread attention from the community. Contemporary benchmarks aim to evaluate the comprehensive capabilities of GUI agents in GUI operation tasks, generally determining task completion solely by inspecting the final screen state. However, GUI operation tasks consist of multiple chained steps while not all critical information is presented in the final few pages. Although a few research has begun to incorporate intermediate steps into evaluation, accurately and automatically capturing this process information still remains an open challenge. To address this weakness, we introduce ProBench, a comprehensive mobile benchmark with over 200 challenging GUI tasks covering widely-used scenarios. Remaining the traditional State-related Task evaluation, we extend our dataset to include Process-related Task and design a specialized evaluation method. A newly introduced Process Provider automatically supplies accurate process information, enabling presice assessment of agent's performance. Our evaluation of advanced GUI agents reveals significant limitations for real-world GUI scenarios. These shortcomings are prevalent across diverse models, including both large-scale generalist models and smaller, GUI-specific models. A detailed error analysis further exposes several universal problems, outlining concrete directions for future improvements.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在提升推理效果的同时显著提高了计算效率，为开发更高效的推理模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

Motivation: 临床时间序列数据具有不规则性、异步采样、缺失值和异质性特征动态等特点。现有嵌入策略通常通过加法操作结合特征标识和值嵌入，限制了捕捉值依赖特征交互的能力。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合特征值和特征标识嵌入，保留特征特定信息的同时建模跨特征的高阶依赖关系。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集（涵盖重症和慢性护理）上的实验表明，MedFuse在关键预测任务上始终优于最先进的基线方法。学习表示的分析进一步证明乘法融合增强了表达能力并支持跨数据集预训练。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了一个可推广的方法，乘法融合机制有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Conclusion: HyperD通过有效解耦周期性和非周期性交通模式，显著提升了交通预测性能，为解决复杂时空依赖和多尺度模式问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 在大型语言模型能力开始超越人类许多任务的生态系统中，这种从训练转向培养的范式转变是至关重要的需求

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Conclusion: 该工作成功展示了语言模型在形式验证领域的应用潜力，通过发布BarrierBench和配套工具链，为语言推理与形式验证的融合建立了社区测试平台。

Abstract: Safety verification of dynamical systems via barrier certificates is essential for ensuring correctness in autonomous applications. Synthesizing these certificates involves discovering mathematical functions with current methods suffering from poor scalability, dependence on carefully designed templates, and exhaustive or incremental function-space searches. They also demand substantial manual expertise--selecting templates, solvers, and hyperparameters, and designing sampling strategies--requiring both theoretical and practical knowledge traditionally shared through linguistic reasoning rather than formalized methods.
  This motivates a key question: can such expert reasoning be captured and operationalized by language models? We address this by introducing an LLM-based agentic framework for barrier certificate synthesis. The framework uses natural language reasoning to propose, refine, and validate candidate certificates, integrating LLM-driven template discovery with SMT-based verification, and supporting barrier-controller co-synthesis to ensure consistency between safety certificates and controllers.
  To evaluate this capability, we introduce BarrierBench, a benchmark of 100 dynamical systems spanning linear, nonlinear, discrete-time, and continuous-time settings. Our experiments assess not only the effectiveness of LLM-guided barrier synthesis but also the utility of retrieval-augmented generation and agentic coordination strategies in improving its reliability and performance. Across these tasks, the framework achieves more than 90% success in generating valid certificates. By releasing BarrierBench and the accompanying toolchain, we aim to establish a community testbed for advancing the integration of language-based reasoning with formal verification in dynamical systems.
  The benchmark is publicly available at https://hycodev.com/dataset/barrierbench

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在学习的表示中访问信息对于高维领域的科学发现至关重要，需要一种能够分析、控制和重新利用潜在表示的机制。

Method: 基于潜在流匹配与分类器自由引导，通过显式分离条件信息与残差表示来解缠潜在子空间。

Result: 在合成2D高斯玩具问题、彩色MNIST和Galaxy10天文数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够访问高维数据的有意义特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为使用生成模型进行科学探索提供了一条途径，可以分析我们未捕获、考虑或编目的信息。

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CrochetBench是一个评估多模态大语言模型在钩针编织领域进行细粒度、低层次程序推理能力的基准测试，强调从描述转向执行，要求模型识别针法、选择结构适当的指令并生成可编译的钩针程序。


<details>

Method: 采用CrochetPARADE DSL作为中间表示，支持结构验证和通过执行的功能评估。基准测试涵盖针法分类、指令落地、自然语言到DSL翻译和图像到DSL翻译等任务。

Result: 在所有任务中，当评估从表面相似性转向可执行正确性时，性能急剧下降，暴露了长距离符号推理和3D感知程序合成的局限性。

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，并突显了表面理解与真实世界创意领域中可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模型聚合的AI安全方法，通过共识采样算法从k个模型中选出最安全的s个子集，在模型间达成足够共识时输出结果，否则弃权。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全检查方法依赖于检查模型输出或激活状态，但某些风险仅通过检查无法检测。需要一种架构无关的补充方法来增强安全性。

Method: 采用共识采样算法，利用模型计算输出概率的能力，当足够多的安全模型达成充分共识时输出结果，否则弃权。算法受到Vyas等人可证明版权保护算法的启发。

Result: 该方法能够实现与k个模型中最安全的s个模型平均风险相当的安全性，并在模型间缺乏足够共识时弃权。当足够多的模型安全且达成充分共识时，弃权概率有界。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种新的、模型无关的AI安全方法，通过将集合中未知子集的安全保证放大到单个可靠模型。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

TL;DR: 本文从科学和系统角度阐述了物理人工智能(Physical AI)的基本原理，旨在为智能系统的物理体现、感知、行动、学习和情境敏感性建立统一的理论框架，将智能视为身体、环境和经验之间真实交互的涌现现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI方法依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而Physical AI将智能理解为身体、环境和经验之间真实交互的涌现现象，需要建立新的理论基础来描述物理体现的智能系统。

Method: 提出了六个基本原则：体现、感知、运动行动、学习、自主性和情境敏感性，这些原则形成一个封闭的控制循环，其中能量、信息、控制和情境持续交互。

Result: 构建了一个理论模型，通过康复诊所中的自适应辅助机器人实例说明物理智能不是来自抽象计算，而是来自直接的、具身的经验。

Conclusion: Physical AI将学习理解为智能体与环境之间结构耦合的变化，而非参数调整，这代表了将智能理解为物理具身过程的范式转变。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.

Abstract: Adversarial optimization algorithms that explicitly search for flaws in agents' policies have been successfully applied to finding robust and diverse policies in multi-agent settings. However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

TL;DR: 比较广度优先搜索(BrFS)和重启随机游走(RRW)在逃离无信息启发式区域(UHR)时的性能，提出EHC-RRW方法并证明其在期望运行时间上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 贪婪搜索方法如GBFS和EHC在面临启发式局部极小值或平台等UHR时表现不佳，需要有效的逃离机制。

Method: 理论推导BrFS和RRW逃离UHR的期望运行时间，提出EHC-RRW方法使用RRW替代BrFS来逃离UHR，并在PDDL规划基准上进行实验验证。

Result: 确定了RRW比BrFS更快的条件，EHC-RRW在EHC有效的情况下具有更强的期望运行时间保证。

Conclusion: RRW在某些情况下比BrFS更适合用于逃离UHR，EHC-RRW方法在实际规划问题中表现良好。

Abstract: Greedy search methods like Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) and Enforced Hill-Climbing (EHC) often struggle when faced with Uninformed Heuristic Regions (UHRs) like heuristic local minima or plateaus. In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective. We also run experiments with these approaches on PDDL planning benchmarks to better understand their relative effectiveness for escaping UHRs.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于有限差分的曲率正则化框架，用于神经符号距离场学习，通过轻量级有限差分模板替代昂贵的二阶自动微分，在保持重建质量的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用二阶自动微分来强制曲率先验，虽然准确但计算成本高昂；其他方法避免显式Hessian组装但仍需高阶微分。需要一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用轻量级有限差分模板，基于泰勒展开近似二阶导数（截断误差O(h²)），可作为高斯曲率和秩缺失损失的即插即用替代品。

Result: 实验表明有限差分变体达到与自动微分相当的重建保真度，同时GPU内存使用和训练时间减少高达两倍；在稀疏、不完整和非CAD数据上验证了方法的鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: 提出的公式为曲率感知SDF学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a finite-difference framework for curvature regularization in neural signed distance field (SDF) learning. Existing approaches enforce curvature priors using full Hessian information obtained via second-order automatic differentiation, which is accurate but computationally expensive. Others reduced this overhead by avoiding explicit Hessian assembly, but still required higher-order differentiation. In contrast, our method replaces these operations with lightweight finite-difference stencils that approximate second derivatives using the well known Taylor expansion with a truncation error of O(h^2), and can serve as drop-in replacements for Gaussian curvature and rank-deficiency losses. Experiments demonstrate that our finite-difference variants achieve reconstruction fidelity comparable to their automatic-differentiation counterparts, while reducing GPU memory usage and training time by up to a factor of two. Additional tests on sparse, incomplete, and non-CAD data confirm that the proposed formulation is robust and general, offering an efficient and scalable alternative for curvature-aware SDF learning.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了真实表面光源的建模问题，为自由曲面透镜设计提供了更准确的光源表示方案。

Abstract: Designing freeform surfaces to control light based on real-world illumination patterns is challenging, as existing caustic lens designs often assume oversimplified point or parallel light sources. We propose representing surface light sources using an optimized set of point sources, whose parameters are fitted to the real light source's illumination using a novel differentiable rendering framework. Our physically-based rendering approach simulates light transmission using flux, without requiring prior knowledge of the light source's intensity distribution. To efficiently explore the light source parameter space during optimization, we apply a contraction mapping that converts the constrained problem into an unconstrained one. Using the optimized light source model, we then design the freeform lens shape considering flux consistency and normal integrability. Simulations and physical experiments show our method more accurately represents real surface light sources compared to point-source approximations, yielding caustic lenses that produce images closely matching the target light distributions.
