*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TinyViT-Batten框架，使用小参数Vision Transformer和少样本学习从儿童脑部MRI中检测早期Batten病，在79例确诊患者和90例对照数据上达到91%准确率和0.95 AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病是一种罕见儿科神经退行性疾病，早期MRI征象细微易被忽略，需要开发能够在有限训练样本下准确检测的AI方法。

Method: 将大型教师ViT蒸馏为500万参数的TinyViT，使用基于度量的少样本学习（原型损失，5样本片段）进行微调，并集成Grad-CAM提供可解释性。

Result: 在多中心数据集上达到约91%准确率和至少0.95 AUC，灵敏度>90%，特异性约90%，优于3D-ResNet和Swin-Tiny基线模型。

Conclusion: 模型的小尺寸和强性能展示了早期Batten病检测的实用AI解决方案，通过Grad-CAM提供可解释的预测。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Omni Swift Action Tokenizer，通过B样条编码和多阶段残差量化学习紧凑、可迁移的动作表示，将训练序列缩短6.8倍，并开发跨具身学习策略利用异构演示数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归VLA模型在处理动作块时面临序列过长和高维度问题，现有压缩方法存在重构质量差或压缩效率低的问题。

Method: 使用B样条编码进行值范围和时间范围归一化，然后对位置、旋转和夹爪子空间应用多阶段残差量化，生成具有粗到细粒度的压缩离散标记。

Result: 在Droid数据集上预训练后，离散标记化将训练序列缩短6.8倍，降低目标熵，在真实机器人和仿真实验中实现更高压缩比同时保持重构质量。

Conclusion: OmniSAT实现了高效压缩和高质量重构，加速了自回归训练收敛并提升了模型性能，同时跨具身学习策略有效利用了异构演示数据。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种知识感知的Mamba模型(KAMamba)用于MODIS时间序列变化检测，通过知识驱动的转换矩阵、多任务学习、时空谱Mamba模块和稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络，显著提升了变化检测和土地利用分类的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测面临混合像素、时空谱信息耦合效应和背景类别异质性等挑战，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的转换矩阵引导方法(KAT-loss)、多任务学习框架(包含PreC-loss、PostC-loss和Chg-loss)、时空谱Mamba模块(SSTMamba)和稀疏可变形Mamba骨干网络(SDMamba)。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS时间序列数据集上，变化检测的平均F1值比基线方法提高了1.5-6%，土地利用分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提高了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba模型通过知识整合和多任务学习有效解决了MODIS变化检测的关键挑战，在精度和效率方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [A Framework for Low-Effort Training Data Generation for Urban Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11567)
*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，能够将现成的合成数据集适配到特定目标域，仅使用不完美的伪标签进行训练，生成高保真、目标对齐的图像，显著提升语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据集与真实图像之间存在明显差距，特别是在特定目标域（如Cityscapes）中，这种差距限制了模型性能。传统方法需要昂贵的3D建模，违背了低成本标注数据的初衷。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，仅通过不完美的伪标签进行目标域适配训练，能够从任何合成数据集的语义图生成高保真图像。方法包括过滤次优生成、校正图像标签不对齐问题，以及跨数据集语义标准化。

Result: 在5个合成数据集和2个真实目标数据集上的实验显示，相比最先进的翻译方法，语义分割性能提升高达+8.0% mIoU，使快速构建的合成数据集达到与耗时数月手动设计的高质量合成数据集相当的效果。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一种有价值的协作范式，快速语义原型设计与生成模型相结合，能够为城市场景理解创建可扩展、高质量的训练数据。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

### [7] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NNDM混合框架，结合NN-UNet和扩散模型，通过迭代去噪过程提升脑肿瘤分割的边界精度和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型在脑肿瘤MRI分割中存在泛化能力不足、边界精度差和数据多样性有限的问题

Method: 集成NN-UNet的稳健特征提取与扩散模型的生成能力，通过扩散模型学习预测掩码与真实掩码之间的残差误差分布，迭代细化分割结果

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上优于传统U-Net和基于transformer的基线方法，在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离指标上均有提升

Conclusion: NNDM为结合确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型开辟了新方向，推进了自动脑肿瘤分析的技术水平

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的微表情识别方法，通过两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）和自适应融合网络，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情具有强度低、持续时间短的特点，难以被肉眼察觉，但在测谎、行为分析和心理评估中具有重要价值。现有方法在捕捉微表情的时序动态和细微运动方面存在不足。

Method: 提出两种互补表示：时间排序动态图像（强调时序进展）和运动强度动态图像（通过帧重排序机制突出细微运动）。设计自适应融合网络，自动学习最优整合策略，增强判别性特征并抑制噪声。

Result: 在CASME-II数据集上达到93.95%准确率和0.897 UF1，创下新纪录；在SAMM数据集上获得82.47%准确率和0.665 UF1，显示更好的类别平衡性；在MMEW数据集上达到76.00%准确率，验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 输入表示和网络架构都对提升微表情识别性能起关键作用，为情感计算、测谎和人机交互领域的研究和应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过多模态大语言模型的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，在不改变模型权重或架构的情况下重新分配空间分辨率到模型认为重要的区域，从而改善细粒度感知定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在杂乱场景中经常错过小细节和空间关系，导致细粒度感知定位错误。

Method: 使用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，将空间分辨率重新分配到模型认为重要的区域，同时压缩信息较少的区域并保持全局上下文。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp持续提高准确性，增强组合推理能力，减少幻觉，优于四个竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲优先考虑与查询相关的信息同时保持上下文，相同的MLLM在接收这种扭曲输入时表现更好。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Motivation: 探索外语学习者在图像-句子配对的多模态环境中如何推断生词含义，以及影响推断成功的关键因素

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同的图像-文本配对，分析数据特征（图像和文本）与参与者推断成功的关系，并研究AI系统预测参与者表现的能力

Result: 发现只有部分直观特征与参与者表现有强相关性，需要进一步研究预测性特征；AI系统在预测参与者表现方面显示出改进潜力

Conclusion: 需要进一步研究多模态外语学习任务中的预测性特征，AI系统在预测学习者表现方面有改进空间

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应确定视觉语言任务最优分辨率的方法，并通过参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLMs的视觉输入分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型(VLLMs)通常预设固定分辨率用于下游任务，导致性能不佳。现实世界视觉语言应用需要不同粒度的感知能力。

Method: 首先研究不同视觉语言任务的分辨率偏好，发现其与图像复杂度和VLLM在不同分辨率下的不确定性方差相关，提出经验公式确定最优分辨率；然后提出参数高效微调技术扩展预训练VLLMs的视觉输入分辨率。

Result: 在多种视觉语言任务上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过自适应确定最优分辨率和扩展VLLMs的视觉输入分辨率，能够显著提升视觉语言任务的性能。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on
these datasets to show the pitfalls and potentials of different approaches.

TL;DR: 使用合成人脸数据增强单形态攻击检测，通过控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像可改善泛化能力，但仅使用合成数据会导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由于隐私问题导致真实图像大规模数据集可用性受限的问题，探索合成数据在单形态攻击检测中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用多种形态生成工具和跨数据集评估方案，实施增量测试协议来评估随着合成图像添加的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，通过精心控制合成图像数量或逐步添加真实图像可以改善泛化能力，但过度使用合成数据会导致性能下降，仅使用合成数据时获得最高的等错误率。

Conclusion: 在操作场景中，最佳选择不应仅依赖合成数据进行单形态攻击检测，需要谨慎控制合成数据的使用比例。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

*Peixian Liang,Yifan Ding,Yizhe Zhang,Jianxu Chen,Hao Zheng,Hongxiao Wang,Yejia Zhang,Guangyu Meng,Tim Weninger,Michael Niemier,X. Sharon Hu,Danny Z Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新型像素聚类方法，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素划分为细胞实例，在六个数据集上的实验表明该方法优于现有的像素聚类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细胞实例分割方法基于像素级目标，可能丢失细胞实例的重要几何属性（如形状、曲率和凸性），这些属性需要像素集合来表示。

Method: Ceb首先通过改进的分水岭算法提取潜在的前景-前景边界，为每个边界候选构建边界特征表示（边界签名），然后使用边界分类器预测其二元边界标签，最后基于预测的边界标签通过划分或合并相邻区域获得细胞实例。

Result: 在六个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Ceb在语义分割概率图上优于现有的像素聚类方法，并且与最先进的细胞实例分割方法相比具有高度竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: Ceb方法通过利用细胞边界特征有效解决了像素级目标丢失几何属性的问题，在细胞实例分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

*Zhi Chen,Xin Yu,Xiaohui Tao,Yan Li,Zi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning (CAPEL)框架，通过在分类logits空间进行集成，保留上下文提示的聚类特性，解决传统提示集成中特征平均导致类别质心偏移的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的提示集成方法通过平均文本特征来代表类别，但这种方法会导致类别质心偏离真实类别分布，产生次优结果。

Method: CAPEL将图像分类到多个类别聚类中，每个聚类由不同的提示表示；在分类logits空间进行集成；引入保持聚类的正则化项；集成自适应提示加权技术。

Result: 该方法能更好地与视觉特征分布对齐，保持提示的区分性，防止崩溃到统一方向，并在不同数据集和任务上实现鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CAPEL通过聚类感知的提示集成学习，有效解决了传统提示集成方法的局限性，提升了视觉语言模型的零样本迁移性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多目标跟踪方法，使用深度和掩码特征融合的自监督编码器生成稳定对象表示，作为边界框IoU和重识别特征的补充相似性线索，避免计算分割掩码IoU的高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割掩码IoU计算成本高。需要更稳定和高效的对象表示方法。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督训练的紧凑编码器生成对象表示。使用零样本深度估计器获取深度图，可提示视觉分割模型获取对象掩码。将生成的对象表示与边界框IoU和重识别特征结合用于匹配。

Result: 在具有非线性运动、遮挡和拥挤场景的挑战性基准测试（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）上，该方法在大多数指标上优于TBD最先进方法，在简单线性运动基准测试（如MOT17）上达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使用自监督编码器来优化分割掩码而不计算掩码IoU，为多目标跟踪提供了更稳定和高效的对象表示方案。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

Motivation: 现有HDR视频质量评估数据集主要关注专业生成内容，缺乏对真实世界用户生成HDR视频中多样化失真情况的研究。

Method: 通过Amazon Mechanical Turk进行大规模主观研究，收集856个UGC-HDR源视频，在不同分辨率和比特率下转码生成5,992个视频样本。

Result: 建立了首个大规模UGC-HDR视频质量数据集CHUG，包含211,848个感知评分，为分析UGC特定失真提供了基准。

Conclusion: CHUG数据集将推动无参考HDR视频质量评估研究，提供了一个大规模、多样化且真实的UGC数据集。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内多房间场景通常具有不规则布局和复杂结构，包含杂乱、遮挡和平坦墙面，需要高效利用有限资源来从不完整观测生成沉浸式体验

Method: 在估计的几何支架上记录观测统计，指导基函数的最优放置；提出场景自适应虚拟视点来补偿输入轨迹中的几何缺陷并施加正则化

Result: 在多个大规模室内场景中，相比采用规则布局的基线方法，在渲染质量和内存需求方面都显示出显著提升

Conclusion: 基于几何先验的场景自适应策略能够有效优化神经辐射场表示，在复杂室内环境中实现更好的渲染效果和资源利用

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决日常环境中频繁场景变化带来的挑战，传统方法需要密集的空间和时间观察，而稀疏捕获难以满足需求。

Method: 使用高斯泼溅表示，构建对象模板高斯作为结构先验，通过少样本观察调整模板以适应时间变化环境，支持多时间步泛化。

Conclusion: LTGS框架能有效处理稀疏捕获下的长期场景变化，显著提升3D环境时间演化的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个多视角动物姿态估计框架，结合了多视角Transformer、几何一致性增强、改进的Ensemble Kalman Smoother后处理和模型蒸馏技术，在有限标注数据下实现准确跟踪和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多视角姿态估计方法在有限标注数据下准确性不足，且不确定性估计效果差，这限制了动物行为量化研究的可靠性。

Method: 使用多视角Transformer同时处理所有视角信息；引入补丁掩码学习跨视角对应关系；通过3D增强和三角化损失整合几何一致性；扩展非线性Ensemble Kalman Smoother并改进不确定性量化；设计蒸馏过程利用改进的预测生成高质量伪标签。

Conclusion: 开发了一个实用的不确定性感知系统，能够在真实世界数据约束下实现可靠的姿态估计，支持下游行为分析。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

*Renjie Li,Zihao Zhu,Xiaoyu Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HeadsUp模型，这是一个单步扩散模型，专门用于肖像图像超分辨率，能够端到端地无缝恢复和放大肖像图像，解决了传统方法中面部区域与背景混合时产生的边界伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像超分辨率技术要么专注于通用真实世界图像，要么专注于严格对齐的人脸图像。在处理肖像照片时，需要混合使用不同模型来处理面部区域和背景，这不可避免地会在面部区域周围引入混合或边界伪影。由于人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感，因此需要一种能够无缝处理整个肖像图像的方法。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型构建，开发了面部监督机制来引导模型关注面部区域，并集成了基于参考的机制来帮助身份恢复，减少低质量人脸恢复中的面部模糊。同时构建了高质量的4K肖像图像超分辨率数据集PortraitSR-4K来支持模型训练和基准测试。

Result: 大量实验表明，HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务上实现了最先进的性能，同时在通用图像和对齐人脸数据集上保持相当或更高的性能。

Conclusion: HeadsUp模型通过端到端的方式有效解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，避免了传统混合方法产生的边界伪影，在保持面部保真度的同时实现了高质量的整体图像恢复。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合去噪扩散模型和Controlnet，有效解决了水下图像数据集多样性不足和质量低的问题，为海洋环境监测和生态系统研究提供了更好的数据支持。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐式神经表示(INR)的新方法，用于建模脑部衰老轨迹，通过将纵向MRI数据表示为连续函数，解决了传统深度学习方法在处理离散、不规则采样数据时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类大脑在整个生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，纵向MRI数据对于表征典型和非典型衰老轨迹很有价值。但由于数据的离散性和不同时空采样模式，传统深度学习方法难以表示潜在的连续生物过程。

Method: 使用隐式神经表示(INR)将纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，设计了能够部分解耦空间和时间轨迹参数的新型INR架构，并开发了直接在INR参数空间上操作的分类框架。

Result: 在更现实的不规则采样实验中，基于INR的方法在脑衰老轨迹分类任务中达到81.3%的准确率，优于标准深度学习基线模型(73.7%)。

Conclusion: INR方法能够有效处理不规则采样的纵向神经影像数据，为表征脑部衰老轨迹提供了新的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Motivation: 现有分割模型在基准测试中表现良好，但在真实场景中容易依赖虚假相关性而非真实物体边界，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 将人类修正视为干预信号，通过传播修正信息到视觉相似的图像中，系统性地纠正模型的失败模式，迭代地引导模型学习语义特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建准确、鲁棒、数据高效且适应真实世界领域的分割系统提供了实用方法，适用于城市气候监测和自动驾驶等应用。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

*Salma J. Ahmed,Emad A. Mohammed,Azam Asilian Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出J-RAS联合训练方法，将分割模型与检索模型结合优化，通过检索图像-掩码对增强分割性能，在多个数据集和架构上取得显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中人工标注耗时且存在变异性，以及AI方法需要大量标注数据和泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 联合训练分割模型和检索模型，分割模型利用检索到的图像-掩码对增强解剖理解，检索模型学习分割相关特征，实现检索为分割提供有意义的上下文指导。

Result: 在ACDC数据集上，SegFormer结合J-RAS后Dice分数从0.8708提升到0.9115，Hausdorff距离从1.8130降低到1.1489，在多个架构和数据集上均表现出一致改进。

Conclusion: J-RAS方法有效提升了医学图像分割性能，具有良好的泛化能力，能够适应不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于AI的端到端框架，利用现有交通摄像头基础设施进行大规模高分辨率纵向交通分析，通过微调YOLOv11模型提取多模态交通密度和分类指标，并引入图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通监测传感器部署成本高、维护困难，而现有视频分析技术难以应对动态摄像头视角和大规模摄像头网络产生的海量数据，需要一种成本效益高且可扩展的交通监测解决方案。

Method: 使用微调的YOLOv11模型进行实时交通密度和分类指标提取；引入图基视角归一化方法处理非固定PTZ摄像头；集成领域特定大语言模型处理24/7视频流数据生成自动化交通模式总结。

Result: 在纽约市拥堵收费政策早期实施期间验证，结果显示拥堵缓解区内工作日乘用车密度下降9%，卡车流量早期减少但出现反弹迹象，行人和自行车活动在走廊和区域尺度上持续增加。基于示例的提示提高了LLM的数值准确性并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了作为实用、基础设施就绪的解决方案的潜力，能够以最小人工干预进行大规模、政策相关的交通监测。

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理原理的镜头光晕数据生成方法FlareX，包含参数化模板创建、光照感知2D合成和物理引擎3D渲染三个阶段，解决了现有合成数据集缺乏光晕多样性和忽略物理原理的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有镜头光晕数据集通常通过将人工光晕模板叠加到背景图像上来合成，但模板缺乏多样性且忽略物理原理，导致训练模型难以泛化到真实场景。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) 参数化模板创建；2) 光照感知2D合成；3) 物理引擎3D渲染。最终生成包含2D和3D视角的混合数据集FlareX，包含9500个2D模板和3000个3D渲染图像对。

Result: 构建了FlareX数据集，包含9500个2D模板（来自95种光晕模式）和3000个光晕图像对（来自60个3D场景）。设计了掩码方法从真实光斑图像中获取无光斑图像来评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了所提方法和数据集的有效性，能够更好地泛化到真实世界场景。

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

*Lishen Qu,Zhihao Liu,Shihao Zhou,Yaqi Luo,Jie Liang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang,Jufeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BurstDeflicker数据集，通过三种互补的数据采集策略解决闪烁伪影去除研究中缺乏大规模真实数据集的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滚动快门相机与交流电照明的时间强度变化相互作用导致短曝光图像中出现闪烁伪影，表现为不均匀亮度分布和暗带。这种结构化噪声不仅影响图像质量，还影响物体检测和跟踪等高级任务。缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了闪烁去除研究的进展。

Method: 1. 开发基于Retinex的合成流程，可控制关键闪烁属性（强度、区域、频率）的操纵；2. 从不同场景捕获4000张真实闪烁图像；3. 提出绿屏方法，在保持真实闪烁退化的同时将运动纳入图像对。

Result: 构建了可扩展的BurstDeflicker基准数据集，综合实验证明了数据集的有效性。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集具有推动闪烁去除研究进展的潜力，通过三种互补策略解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MIMO模型，解决现有医疗视觉语言模型的两个问题：输入仅依赖文本指令缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解，输出仅提供文本答案缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。MIMO具有视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型存在两个主要问题：输入方面仅依赖文本指令而缺乏对图像视觉线索的直接理解；输出方面仅提供文本答案而缺乏与图像关键区域的连接。这些问题限制了模型对复杂医疗图像和语义的理解能力。

Method: 提出统一的医疗视觉语言模型MIMO，具有视觉参考多模态输入和像素定位多模态输出能力。构建了包含89.5万个样本的MIMOSeg数据集，从四个不同角度覆盖基础指令跟随和复杂问答任务。

Result: 在多个下游医疗多模态任务上的实验结果表明，MIMO能够独特地结合视觉参考和像素定位能力，这是以往模型所不具备的。

Conclusion: MIMO模型成功解决了现有医疗视觉语言模型的局限性，通过多模态输入输出设计实现了对医疗图像的更深入理解，为医疗多模态任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Query-Adapter（Q-Adapter）——一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于增强多模态大语言模型在视频字幕任务中的高效微调，仅需1.4%参数即可达到与全微调方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法主要关注语言组件，在视觉信息理解方面研究不足，且随着模型规模增大，全模型微调变得计算成本过高。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可有效提取稀疏的、与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在PEFT方法中实现了最先进的性能，在BLEU@4、METEOR、ROUGE-L和CIDEr指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter在平衡字幕质量和参数效率方面具有强大潜力，展示了其在视频语言建模中的可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: P-4DGS是一种新颖的动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过空间-时间预测、自适应量化和熵编码技术，显著压缩动态场景的存储需求，在保持高质量重建的同时实现高达40-90倍的压缩比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的动态3D高斯泼溅算法忽略了动态场景中固有的时间和空间冗余，导致内存消耗过高，需要开发更紧凑的4D场景建模方法。

Method: 设计基于3D锚点的空间-时间预测模块来利用3D高斯基元间的时空相关性，结合自适应量化和上下文熵编码进一步压缩3D锚点大小。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的重建质量和最快的渲染速度，平均存储占用仅约1MB，在合成和真实场景上分别达到40倍和90倍的压缩比。

Conclusion: P-4DGS通过有效利用时空相关性，在动态3D场景表示中实现了优异的压缩效率和重建质量平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

TL;DR: CCFormer是一个新颖的音频-视觉分割框架，通过互补和对比Transformer处理局部和全局信息，结合早期集成模块、多查询Transformer模块和双模态对比学习，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而基于Transformer的方法在提取多模态系数和时序动态方面存在困难。需要一种能全面处理局部和全局信息、捕捉时空上下文的方法。

Method: 提出CCFormer框架：1)早期集成模块(EIM)并行融合多尺度视觉特征和音频数据；2)多查询Transformer模块(MTM)动态赋予音频查询学习能力，同时建模帧级和视频级关系；3)双模态对比学习(BCL)促进统一特征空间中的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上均达到了新的最先进性能基准。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过有效结合局部-全局信息处理和时空上下文捕捉，成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在音频-视觉分割任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

TL;DR: ViTAR是一个模仿人类专家迭代推理过程的医学视觉语言模型框架，通过"思考-行动-再思考-回答"的认知链实现多步视觉推理，在医学诊断任务中超越现有最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家在临床实践中会迭代扫描、聚焦和细化感兴趣区域后才做出最终诊断。

Method: 提出ViTAR框架，将医学图像视为交互对象，支持多步视觉推理；构建包含1K交互示例的高质量指令数据集和16K视觉问答训练数据；采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调引导认知轨迹，强化学习优化决策。

Result: ViTAR在广泛评估中优于强基线模型；视觉注意力分析显示从"思考"到"再思考"阶段，模型逐渐将视觉基础锚定到临床关键区域，并在推理过程中保持对视觉标记的高注意力分配。

Conclusion: 将专家风格的迭代思维链嵌入视觉语言模型可以增强医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

### [39] [Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Multiple Randomly Masked Autoencoders for Semi-supervised Multi-modal Multi-task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10068)
*Pîrvu Mihai-Cristian,Leordeanu Marius*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PHG-MAE模型，将神经图与掩码自编码器结合，通过随机掩码整个模态来采样超边分布，统一预训练和微调，并支持推理时集成和知识蒸馏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督预训练中需要手动标注数据的问题，统一神经图和掩码自编码器方法，提升多模态多任务学习效率。

Method: 使用概率超图和掩码自编码器，随机掩码整个模态而非仅图像块，在单次训练循环中结合预训练和微调，支持推理集成和知识蒸馏。

Result: 模型在无人机场景中表现良好，支持少于100万参数的小模型知识蒸馏，性能损失小，并可扩展到自动驾驶等领域。

Conclusion: PHG-MAE为多模态多任务学习提供了有效框架，发布了自动化数据流水线和扩展数据集，所有技术细节和代码已公开。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

*Meijun Zhou,Gang Mei,Zhengjing Ma,Nengxiong Xu,Jianbing Peng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉基础模型的通用框架，用于追踪大规模滑坡疤痕的时空演化，通过将离散遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，实现滑坡演化的连续监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单阶段或前后双阶段的滑坡识别，难以追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化过程，而这对理解演化机制和早期预警至关重要。

Method: 将离散光学遥感图像重构为连续视频序列，利用为视频分割开发的视觉基础模型，在知识引导、自动传播和交互精炼的范式下进行滑坡疤痕识别。

Result: 在Baige滑坡和Sela滑坡(2017-2025)两个代表性案例中验证，框架能够连续追踪滑坡疤痕，捕捉早期预警所需的失稳前兆和评估次生灾害所需的失稳后演化。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效追踪滑坡疤痕的时空演化，为早期预警和长期稳定性评估提供重要支持。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

*Jiahui Lu,Haihong Xiao,Xueyan Zhao,Wenxiong Kang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gesplat是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的框架，能够从无姿态的稀疏图像中实现稳健的新视角合成和几何一致的重建，通过VGGT基础模型获取初始姿态和密集点云，结合混合高斯表示和深度正则化等技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF和3DGS方法严重依赖准确的相机姿态和密集的视角覆盖，限制了它们在稀疏视角设置中的应用，因为姿态估计变得不可靠且监督不足。

Method: 1) 使用VGGT基础模型获取可靠的初始姿态和密集点云；2) 具有双位置-形状优化的混合高斯表示，通过视图间匹配一致性增强；3) 图引导的属性细化模块；4) 基于流的深度正则化。

Result: 在正向视角和大规模复杂数据集上的综合定量和定性实验表明，该方法相比其他无姿态方法实现了更稳健的性能。

Conclusion: Gesplat框架成功克服了现有方法对准确相机姿态和密集视角的依赖，在稀疏视角设置下实现了可靠的新视角合成和几何一致重建。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

TL;DR: 首次将无监督联邦学习扩展到分类问题，提出FedCoPL方法，利用CLIP模型和伪标签分布调整来解决类别不平衡问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督联邦学习主要关注表示学习和聚类任务，而视觉语言模型（如CLIP）的零样本预测能力为分类问题提供了新机会，但尚未在UFL范式下探索

Method: FedCoPL方法：客户端估计并上传伪标签分布，服务器调整并重新分发以避免全局类别不平衡；引入部分提示聚合协议，视觉提示在服务器聚合，文本提示在本地保留

Result: 大量实验证明FedCoPL相比基线方法具有优越性能

Conclusion: 成功将UFL扩展到分类问题，提出的FedCoPL方法有效解决了类别不平衡问题，实现了良好的协作和个性化

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

*Minbin Huang,Runhui Huang,Chuanyang Zheng,Jingyao Li,Guoxuan Chen,Han Shi,Hong Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ACRE方法，通过在GRPO算法中加入一致性检查来解决多模态LLM中推理链与最终答案不一致的问题，显著提升了答案与推理之间的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于结果驱动的强化学习方法虽然能提高答案准确性，但会导致推理过程与最终答案之间的不一致性，在实验中标准GRPO方法在MMVU上只有79.7%的一致性。

Method: ACRE方法在GRPO算法基础上增加辅助一致性检查：模型生成推理链和初始答案后，打乱答案选项并基于相同推理链预测第二个答案，设计一致性验证奖励机制。

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理基准测试中，ACRE相比GRPO基线分别实现了2.2%和1.5%的平均改进。

Conclusion: ACRE方法有效解决了多模态LLM中推理-答案不一致的问题，通过一致性验证奖励机制提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知的后检测框架，通过统计不确定性和视觉特征重新调整检测置信度，提升紧凑深度学习模型在火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉的火灾烟雾检测方法在效率和可靠性之间存在平衡问题，紧凑模型如YOLOv5n/YOLOv8n在部署时容易出现误报和漏检，传统后处理方法仅依赖空间重叠容易抑制真阳性或保留误报。

Method: 提出轻量级置信度精炼网络，集成不确定性估计与颜色、边缘、纹理特征来调整检测分数，无需修改基础模型。

Result: 在D-Fire数据集上的实验显示，相比现有基线方法，精确率、召回率和平均精度均有提升，计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 后检测重评分能有效增强紧凑深度学习模型在真实世界火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像篡改技术发展带来安全威胁，需要有效的篡改定位方法。现有监督方法依赖昂贵的像素级标注，而弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC框架包含对象化规则构建与自适应过滤来建立可靠知识库，以及多步骤渐进推理流程，模拟专家取证工作流，从粗粒度提案到细粒度取证结果。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ICFC不仅超越了最先进的无训练方法，而且在与弱监督和全监督方法的比较中达到了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: ICFC通过系统性地利用MLLM推理能力，实现了图像级分类、像素级定位和文本级可解释性，为图像取证提供了有效的无需训练解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ImmerIris数据集，这是目前最大的公开VR头显采集的离轴虹膜数据集，包含499,791张眼部图像和564个受试者。针对现有方法在沉浸式场景下表现不佳的问题，作者提出了无需归一化的识别方法，在多个挑战性因素下表现优于基于归一化的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在增强现实和虚拟现实等自我中心应用中，沉浸式虹膜识别正在成为一种准确且无缝的身份识别方式。然而，沉浸式设置主要通过倾斜放置的头显相机捕获离轴虹膜，这带来了透视畸变、质量退化加剧和虹膜纹理类内变化等独特挑战，而现有的数据集很少能捕捉这些挑战。

Method: 1) 构建ImmerIris数据集，通过VR头显采集大规模离轴虹膜图像；2) 设计评估协议来基准测试不同挑战因素下的识别方法；3) 提出无需归一化的识别范式，直接从眼部图像学习，仅需最小调整。

Result: 基于ImmerIris数据集的评估显示，当前主要为经典轴对齐图像设计的方法在沉浸式设置下表现不理想，主要归因于对易出错的归一化过程的依赖。作者提出的无需归一化方法虽然简单，但一致优于基于归一化的对应方法。

Conclusion: 无需归一化的识别范式为鲁棒的沉浸式识别指明了一个有前景的方向，该方法在应对离轴虹膜识别的独特挑战方面表现更优。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

TL;DR: 提出基于注意力增强CNN-BiLSTM的多类别帕金森病检测系统，通过手指敲击视频分析运动特征，实现帕金森病严重程度的自动分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于手势的帕金森病识别系统性能不理想，需要开发更准确的帕金森病严重程度评估方法，以支持临床管理和干预开发。

Method: 收集手指敲击视频，提取手腕和手部运动的时域、频域和幅度特征，构建CNN-BiLSTM-注意力混合深度学习框架进行多类别帕金森病严重程度分类。

Result: 模型在区分五个严重程度类别方面表现出色，表明整合时空表征与注意力机制可以改善自动帕金森病严重程度检测。

Conclusion: 该系统有望成为支持临床医生进行帕金森病监测和进展跟踪的有前景的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

Motivation: 解决低光图像增强和超分辨率任务中现有方法参数过多、计算量大、SSIM和PSNR指标低的问题。

Method: 基于自动编码器的DeepFusionNet架构，使用轻量级设计，低光增强版本约250万参数，超分辨率版本仅约10万参数。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，低光增强任务SSIM达92.8%，PSNR达26.30；超分辨率任务SSIM达80.7%，PSNR达25.30。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在保持高性能的同时大幅减少了参数数量，为实时图像处理应用提供了有效的轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Color3D是一个用于从单色输入对静态和动态3D场景进行着色的高度适应性框架，通过个性化颜色器实现跨视图和时间的一致性，同时保持色彩多样性和用户可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注静态场景，通过平均颜色变化来强制多视图一致性，但这牺牲了色彩丰富性和可控性。需要一种既能保持色彩多样性又能确保跨视图和时间一致性的方法。

Method: 核心思路是仅对一个关键视图进行着色，然后微调个性化颜色器将其颜色传播到新视图和时间步。通过个性化学习场景特定的确定性颜色映射，利用其内在归纳偏置将对应颜色一致地投影到新视图和视频帧。

Result: 在多样化的静态和动态3D着色基准测试中，该方法能够提供更一致且色彩丰富的渲染结果，并具有精确的用户控制能力。

Conclusion: 该框架巧妙地将复杂的3D着色问题重新表述为更易处理的单图像范式，允许无缝集成任意图像着色模型，增强了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

Method: 结合使用nnUNet进行病变检测的分割分支、用于血管映射和识别的动脉图谱，以及使用pGAN从MRI合成MRA图像的生成分支。

Abstract: A key challenge in ischemic stroke diagnosis using medical imaging is the
accurate localization of the occluded vessel. Current machine learning methods
in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

*Benjia Zhou,Bin Fu,Pei Cheng,Yanru Wang,Jiayuan Fan,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReMix是一个统一的字符一致性生成和编辑框架，包含ReMix模块和IP-ControlNet两个核心组件，解决了现有方法在身份一致性和空间可控性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单一框架中统一字符一致性生成和编辑任务。基于生成的方法在跨实例的细粒度身份一致性方面存在困难，而基于编辑的方法往往失去空间可控性和指令对齐。

Method: ReMix模块利用MLLM的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征，无需微调即可将指令嵌入适配到原生DiT骨干网络。IP-ControlNet扩展ControlNet，从参考图像中解耦语义和布局线索，并引入ε-等变潜在空间，在共享噪声空间中联合去噪参考图像和目标图像。

Result: ReMix支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务。大量实验验证了其作为字符一致性图像生成和编辑统一框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ReMix成功解决了字符一致性生成和编辑的统一问题，通过创新的模块设计实现了语义连贯性和像素级一致性，同时保持了身份特征和姿态可控性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SaFiRe框架，通过模拟人类两阶段认知过程来解决指称图像分割中的表达模糊问题，特别针对对象分散和类别隐式表达，并在新基准aRefCOCO上验证了优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达，无法有效处理真实世界中的指称模糊问题，特别是对象分散表达和类别隐式表达。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，模仿人类两阶段认知过程：先形成全局理解，再通过细节导向检查进行精炼。利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性支持多周期精炼，具有线性复杂度。

Result: 在标准数据集和提出的aRefCOCO基准上的大量实验表明，SaFiRe优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过模拟人类认知过程有效解决了RIS中的表达模糊问题，在具有挑战性的场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 水下生态监测需要语义分割技术，但获取密集专家标注成本高昂，而稀疏点标注虽然容易获得，但面临标注点选择和稀疏信息传播的挑战。

Method: 采用主动采样策略指导标注者选择最有价值的点，然后结合SAM2和超像素方法的混合方法传播稀疏标签。

Result: 在两个不同的水下数据集上，SparseUWSeg优于现有最先进方法，相比D+NN实现了高达+5%的mIoU提升。

Conclusion: 主要贡献是设计并发布了一个简单但有效的交互式标注工具，使生态学研究者能够利用基础模型和计算机视觉高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

TL;DR: ViConEx-Med是一个基于transformer的视觉概念可解释性框架，通过多概念可学习token联合预测和定位视觉概念，在医学应用中提供概念级定位图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念模型将概念视为数值属性，缺乏视觉定位能力，限制了在医疗等高风险场景的实用性。

Method: 使用多概念可学习token，通过专门的注意力层处理视觉和文本概念token，生成概念级定位图。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上的实验表明，ViConEx-Med在概念检测和定位精度上优于现有概念模型，与黑盒模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建基于视觉概念的内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测精度，忽视了利用物体后表面和内部信息的潜力。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标，在两者之间密集采样创建超密集2D-3D对应关系，并提出了分层连续坐标编码(HCCE)来更准确高效地表示前后表面坐标。

Result: 在BOP网站的七个经典核心数据集上，该方法优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 充分利用物体完整表面和内部信息能够有效提高基于PnP算法的姿态估计精度。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Motivation: 无人机产生大量视频数据，但现有文本-视频检索方法在无人机领域应用不足，主要受限于数据集标注粗糙冗余的问题。

Method: 构建DVTMD数据集包含2864个视频和14320个细粒度标注，提出TCMA框架整合全局视频-句子对齐、句子引导帧聚合和词引导补丁对齐，并设计了词和补丁选择模块以及文本自适应动态温度机制。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和TCMA框架有效解决了无人机视频检索问题，为无人机视频内容理解提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型的偏见问题，通过无标签数据实现公平性提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型经常反映并放大训练数据中的人口统计偏见，导致在不同性别和种族子群体中表现不均

Method: 在伪标签选择过程中强制实施人口统计平衡，仅使用来自种族平衡数据集的无标签图像，无需真实标注

Result: 伪平衡方法在整体准确率上提升了6.53%达到79.81%，性别准确率差距减少了44.17%，在东亚子群体中将超过49%的差距缩小到仅5.01%

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，访问人口统计平衡或适度倾斜的无标签数据集可以作为消除现有计算机视觉模型偏见的强大资源

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a
powerful resource for debiasing existing computer vision models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D物体定位方法仅建模成对物体关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性，导致难以处理涉及多个空间关系的复杂描述。

Method: 设计分组监督损失促进n元关系学习，在构建的n元关系场景图中使用带混合注意力机制的多模态网络进一步定位目标物体。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中优于现有最先进方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: n元关系学习能有效提升3D物体定位性能，特别是在处理涉及复杂空间关系的自然语言描述时。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in

### [65] [Opacity-Gradient Driven Density Control for Compact and Efficient Few-Shot 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10257)
*Abdelrhman Elrawy,Emad A. Mohammed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个改进3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景下效率的框架，通过新的致密化触发机制和保守剪枝策略，显著减少基元数量同时保持重建质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在少样本场景中容易过拟合和产生臃肿重建，现有方法虽然提升质量但显著增加基元数量，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 用不透明度梯度作为渲染误差的轻量代理替换位置梯度启发式，采用更保守的剪枝策略防止破坏性优化循环，结合标准深度相关损失提供几何指导

Result: 在3视图LLFF数据集上比FSGS紧凑40%以上（32k vs 57k基元），在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元，在质量-效率帕累托前沿达到新最优

Conclusion: 该框架通过重新设计核心优化策略，在少样本视图合成中实现了效率的根本性改进，建立了质量与效率平衡的新标准

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

TL;DR: VividAnimator是一个端到端的音频和稀疏手部姿态驱动的人体动画框架，通过预训练手部清晰度码本、双流音频感知模块和姿态校准技巧，解决了现有方法中头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频和姿态驱动的人体动画方法存在头部运动僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要原因是音频与头部运动相关性弱，以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本(HCC)编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 设计双流音频感知模块(DSAA)分别建模唇部同步和自然头部姿态动态；3. 引入姿态校准技巧(PCT)通过放松刚性约束来对齐姿态条件。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过创新的手部码本、双流音频建模和姿态校准技术，成功解决了音频姿态驱动动画中的关键问题，实现了高质量的人体动画生成。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通常只依赖透视视图或鸟瞰图特征，无法同时利用细粒度物体细节和空间结构化场景表示，限制了3D物体检测和跟踪性能。

Method: 提出混合检测跟踪框架，通过新颖的蒸馏过程将DINOv2特征蒸馏到BEV表示中，结合PV特征和增强的BEV地图，使用可变形聚合利用这种混合表示。

Conclusion: 基础模型BEV地图有潜力为自动驾驶实现更可靠的感知，展示了结合PV和BEV特征的混合表示方法的有效性。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM2虽然具有快速推理能力，但在眼底图像分割任务上的微调仍然具有挑战性，需要开发参数高效的微调方法。

Method: 在SAM2的图像编码器和掩码解码器中集成低秩适配器，使用结合分割BCE、SoftDice和FocalTversky损失的复合损失函数进行网络调优。

Result: 在11个具有挑战性的眼底分割数据集上评估，SAM2LoRA在跨数据集训练条件下在血管和视盘分割方面均表现出色，Dice分数分别达到0.86和0.93，AUC值分别达到0.98和0.99。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA在显著减少训练开销的同时，实现了最先进的性能，为眼底图像分割提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界场景（如ScanNet）难以捕捉且数据有限，生成具有多样化物体姿态的真实场景是一个开放且具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 引入分解表示法将场景分解为层次化组织的房间程序和物体姿态概念；学习可重用布局模式的函数库；使用大语言模型生成高级程序；学习程序条件模型来分层预测物体姿态；检索并放置3D物体。

Result: FactoredScenes生成了难以与真实ScanNet场景区分的逼真现实世界房间。

Conclusion: 该框架成功合成了逼真的3D场景，证明了分解表示和学习场景结构在场景生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Abstract: Accurate traffic congestion classification is essential for intelligent
transportation systems and real-time urban traffic management. This paper
presents a multimodal framework combining open-vocabulary visual-language
reasoning (CLIP), object detection (YOLO-World), and motion analysis via
MOG2-based background subtraction. The system predicts congestion levels on an
ordinal scale from 1 (free flow) to 5 (severe congestion), enabling
semantically aligned and temporally consistent classification. To enhance
interpretability, we incorporate motion-based confidence weighting and generate
annotated visual outputs. Experimental results show the model achieves 76.7

0.684, significantly outperforming unimodal baselines. These results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in preserving ordinal structure and
leveraging visual-language and motion modalities. Future enhancements include
incorporating vehicle sizing and refined density metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统航拍图像拼接需要70-80%的重叠率，而资源受限的AI系统难以达到这一要求，导致重建质量下降，影响农民对自主监测技术的信任度。

Method: 提出Ortho-Fuse框架，利用光流估计在连续航拍帧之间合成过渡图像，人工增强特征对应关系以改进几何重建。

Result: 实验验证显示最小重叠率要求降低了20%，能够在更低的图像重叠条件下生成可靠的拼接图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI驱动的作物健康监测系统在精准农业中的集成提供了可行路径，有助于克服技术采用障碍。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云补全模型在训练时依赖归纳偏置，难以适应测试时的新结构模式和传感器引起的失真，限制了在安全关键应用中的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出基于MAML的元辅助学习策略，通过两个自监督辅助目标模拟结构和传感器级不完整性，在推理时动态调整共享编码器，并引入自适应λ校准机制平衡梯度。

Result: 在合成、模拟和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，PointMAC通过逐个样本细化实现了最先进的补全质量。

Conclusion: 这是首个将元辅助测试时自适应应用于点云补全的工作，能够有效提升模型对未知模式和失真的适应能力。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a
comprehensive study, comparing them to state-of-the-art time-series FMs, and
demonstrating the general PPG processing ability by reporting results on six
additional tasks. Thus, we provide clinician-scientists with a new set of
powerful tools that is also computationally efficient, thanks to
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques.

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN作为黑盒模型，其决策过程可能受到难以检测的背景信息偏见影响，需要开发方法来识别这些隐藏偏见。

Method: 提出两种方法：1）将图像分割成随机打乱的非重叠小块；2）应用傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波器等图像变换技术来恢复背景噪声信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效识别CNN中的隐藏偏见，区分学习过程中的相关特征和无关特征，提高模型的可解释性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过创新的3D热图中间表示，成功结合了2D和3D模态的优势，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了步态识别性能。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合2D时间轮廓和3D SMPL特征的多模态多任务步态识别框架，通过统一transformer融合多模态特征，同时进行身份识别和人体属性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前步态识别方法通常只关注2D或3D单一模态，无法充分捕捉人类行走模式的几何和动态复杂性。需要多模态融合来提升在低分辨率或无约束环境下的识别性能。

Method: 使用多模态多任务框架，结合2D时间轮廓和3D SMPL特征，通过统一transformer融合特征，同时进行步态识别和年龄、BMI、性别等人体属性估计。

Result: 在BRIAR大规模数据集上（包含长距离达1公里和极端俯仰角达50度的挑战性条件）的实验表明，该方法在步态识别和人体属性估计方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在真实场景中推进基于步态的人类理解方面具有巨大潜力，能够提供更全面和准确的人体分析。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究使用迁移学习从VR游戏视频中提取视觉特征，结合LSTM网络预测晕动症严重程度，准确率达68.4%，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着VR技术的快速发展，晕动症问题阻碍了其广泛应用。现有研究主要利用VR传感器数据，而对基于视频特征预测晕动症的研究有限。

Method: 使用在ImageNet上预训练的InceptionV3模型提取VR游戏视频的高级视觉特征，然后将这些特征输入LSTM网络以捕捉时间动态并预测晕动症严重程度。

Result: 该方法实现了68.4%的晕动症严重程度分类准确率，超越了仅使用视频数据的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为VR开发者提供了评估和减轻晕动症的实际工具，并为未来基于视频的时间建模研究奠定了基础，有助于提升VR应用的用户舒适度。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

*Suyang Xi,Chenxi Yang,Hong Ding,Yiqing Ni,Catherine C. Liu,Yunhao Liu,Chengqi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HuLiRAG是一个人类化检索增强生成框架，通过"什么-哪里-重加权"级联方法解决MLLM在细粒度视觉问答中的幻觉问题，显著提升了定位保真度和事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉问答中经常产生关于物体身份、位置和关系的幻觉，因为文本查询没有明确锚定到视觉参考物。现有的检索增强生成方法缺乏人类化处理，仅关注全局图像信息而缺乏局部细节。

Method: 提出HuLiRAG框架，采用三阶段级联：1)通过开放词汇检测锚定候选参考物（什么）；2)使用SAM衍生掩码进行空间解析恢复细粒度精度（哪里）；3)通过局部与全局对齐的权衡自适应优先排序（重加权）。掩码引导微调进一步将空间证据注入生成过程。

Result: 广泛实验表明，这种人类化级联方法显著提高了定位保真度和事实一致性，同时减少了幻觉，推动了多模态问答向可信推理的发展。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG通过模拟人类认知过程的多阶段处理，将定位从被动偏置转变为对答案制定的显式约束，有效解决了MLLM在细粒度视觉理解中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion是一个单目SE(3)扩散框架，将无标记、基于图像的机器人姿态估计建模为条件去噪扩散过程，通过可见性约束扩散和时序感知反向过程实现姿态增强和精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法使用固定尺度扰动生成训练姿态，缺乏多样性和可见性约束，限制了网络泛化能力。需要一种能生成相机视野内多样化姿态并逐步精炼的方法。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：可见性约束扩散过程用于多样化姿态增强，时序感知反向过程用于渐进姿态精炼。扩散过程将真实姿态扰动为噪声变换，反向过程通过去噪网络迭代预测并精炼姿态。

Result: 在两个基准测试(DREAM和RoboKeyGen)上表现优异，在最具挑战性数据集上达到66.75的AUC，比现有最优方法提升32.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散模型实现了更鲁棒和准确的机器人姿态估计，可见性约束和时序感知精炼方案显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: CoDeGraph是一种零样本图像异常分类和分割算法，通过识别和过滤一致性异常来解决现有方法在处理重复缺陷时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示的方法在处理一致性异常（相似缺陷在多个图像中重复出现）时表现不佳，导致异常分类和分割性能下降。

Method: 构建图像级图结构，将图像作为节点，通过共享一致性异常模式连接边，利用社区检测过滤异常，基于"邻居耗尽"现象识别一致性异常。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ViT-L-14-336骨干网络实现98.3%的AUROC，F1分数66.8%（提升4.2%），AP 68.1%（提升5.4%）。使用DINOv2骨干网络进一步提升分割性能至69.1% F1和71.9% AP。

Conclusion: CoDeGraph算法能有效处理一致性异常，在零样本异常检测任务中显著优于现有方法，且在不同骨干网络下均表现出鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的医学图像分割方法，通过模拟临床专家小组的决策过程来处理标注者间的变异性，将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割标注存在标注者间变异性问题，传统方法简单平均专家标签会丢失临床不确定性信息。

Method: 使用专家签名生成器学习个体标注者风格，然后通过模拟会诊模块从潜在空间智能生成最终分割结果。

Result: 在CBCT和MRI数据集上取得了最先进的结果（92.11%和90.72% Dice分数）。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更稳健和可信的医疗AI系统提供了明确路径，将专家分歧视为有用信号而非噪声。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

TL;DR: 提出了MultiTIPS数据集和多模态预后框架，通过双选项分割、多模态交互和多任务预测来解决TIPS术前预后建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TIPS手术预后结果差异大且常发生肝性脑病，需要准确的术前预后建模。现有方法面临ROI标注耗时、单模态方法可靠性差、单终点预测不完整等挑战，且缺乏公开数据集。

Method: 包含三个核心模块：(1)双选项分割：结合半监督和基础模型实现有限标注下的ROI分割；(2)多模态交互：使用MGRA、POD和CGPE技术实现跨模态特征交互；(3)多任务预测：采用分阶段训练策略同时优化生存、PPG和OHE预测。

Result: 在MultiTIPS数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床应用中具有前景，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

TL;DR: 提出Cross-Modal Guidance(CMG)方法，通过降解视觉-语言注意力来减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题，无需额外训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在严重幻觉问题，倾向于生成与图像无关但语言流畅的响应，主要原因是语言偏见。

Method: 通过自适应掩码关键图像标记的注意力权重来降解视觉-语言感知，利用原始模型与降解后模型输出分布的差异进行解码。

Result: CMG在幻觉特定基准测试中显著提升不同VLM的性能，有效减少语言偏见而不损害模型能力。

Conclusion: CMG方法无需额外条件或训练成本，能有效解决VLM的幻觉问题，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于伪图像的点云处理方法往往忽略点云的结构和语义细节，导致特征融合和判别能力有限，需要一种能更好平衡效率与性能的方法。

Method: 1. 全局-局部特征融合编码模块增强局部特征相关性并捕获全局上下文信息；2. 多分支特征提取网络捕获更多邻域信息并增强轮廓特征判别性；3. 深度特征引导注意力机制提升跨通道特征融合精度。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet框架有效提升了LiDAR点云语义分割的判别能力，在性能和实时性之间取得良好平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MSF-Mamba模型，通过融合局部上下文相邻状态来增强Mamba的局部时空建模能力，解决了微手势识别中长程依赖和局部时空依赖的建模问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长程和局部时空依赖。CNN擅长局部模式但受限于感受野，Transformer能处理长程依赖但计算成本高，而Mamba虽然高效但缺乏局部时空建模能力。

Method: 提出运动感知状态融合Mamba（MSF-Mamba），基于中心帧差异设计运动感知状态融合模块，并开发多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，包含自适应尺度加权模块动态权衡不同尺度的融合状态。

Result: 在两个公开MGR数据集上的实验表明，即使是轻量级版本MSF-Mamba也能达到最先进性能，优于现有的CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，同时保持高效率。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知局部时空建模有效捕捉微手势的细微运动线索，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型具有内在的自我精炼能力，这一发现可为未来研究视觉语言模型学习机制提供重要启示。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

Conclusion: HARoPE为基于Transformer的图像生成模型提供了原则性且可适应的位置感知增强方案，有效解决了标准RoPE在图像生成中的局限性。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D是一个基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过jigsaw操作解耦风格与内容，实现快速、视角一致的3D资产风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D风格迁移方法要么依赖直接参考风格注入，要么使用2D扩散模型的分数蒸馏，存在每场景优化成本高、风格与语义内容纠缠的问题。

Method: 使用jigsaw操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）来抑制对象语义并分离风格统计特征，通过参考到视角的交叉注意力将这些风格线索集成到多视角扩散模型中。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，且延迟显著降低，并能泛化到部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D通过解耦风格与内容，提供了一种高效且视角一致的3D风格迁移解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker)框架，通过视觉推理操作和可配置视觉记忆窗口，让多模态奖励模型能够主动获取和更新视觉证据，解决现有模型在视觉输入处理中的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型面临两个主要问题：(1) 视觉输入消耗大量上下文预算，导致帧数减少和细节丢失；(2) 所有视觉信息都打包到初始提示中，加剧了链式推理过程中的幻觉和遗忘问题。

Method: 采用强化微调流程：1) 使用策划的视觉链式思维数据进行冷启动；2) 选择所有维度判断正确的样本进行拒绝采样微调；3) 应用组相对策略优化来加强推理能力。

Result: 在视频偏好基准测试中达到最先进准确率：7B VR-Thinker在VideoGen Reward上达到80.5%，GenAI-Bench上82.3%，MJ-Bench-Video上75.6%，尤其在长视频上表现优异。

Conclusion: 验证了基于图像思考的多模态奖励建模方法的有效性和前景，为视觉生成模型的后训练提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的查找表方法，通过最优格点向量量化器、不规则扩张卷积和U形级联LUT结构来扩展CNN感受野，在固定表大小下提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LUT方法因表大小组合爆炸导致卷积核感受野受限，需要在保持相同空间复杂度的情况下扩展CNN感受野。

Method: 使用自适应分配量化分辨率的最优格点向量量化器、不规则扩张卷积和U形级联LUT结构来捕获多级上下文信息。

Result: 该方法在速度、精度和内存效率之间取得有效平衡，相比现有LUT方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法能够在不增加表大小的情况下有效扩展CNN感受野，提升LUT驱动的快速CNN推理性能。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇分割和上下文分割方法在架构差异、学习目标和表征学习策略上的不一致问题，构建统一的模型框架。

Method: 利用基础模型提取图像和多模态提示的表征，通过SegDecoder对齐这些表征并建模它们的交互，获得不同粒度的分割掩码。

Result: 在开放词汇分割和上下文分割任务上均取得显著性能提升，多模态提示的协同作用比单模态方法有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: COSINE通过统一架构有效整合了不同分割任务，多模态提示的协同使用显著提升了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

*Binyu Zhao,Wei Zhang,Zhaonian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE)方法来解决多模态学习中缺失模态的问题，特别是在不平衡缺失率下的挑战。MCE包含两个组件：学习能力增强(LCE)和表示能力增强(RCE)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中处理缺失模态，特别是在不平衡缺失率下，是一个主要挑战。这种不平衡会触发恶性循环：缺失率较高的模态获得较少更新，导致学习进度不一致和表示质量下降。现有方法通常关注全局数据集级平衡，忽略了样本级模态效用变化和特征质量下降的问题。

Method: MCE包含两个协同组件：1) 学习能力增强(LCE)：引入多级因子动态平衡模态特定学习进度；2) 表示能力增强(RCE)：通过子集预测和跨模态补全任务改进特征语义和鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试上的综合评估表明，MCE在各种缺失配置下始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MCE有效解决了多模态学习中不平衡缺失率的问题，通过动态平衡学习进度和增强特征表示能力，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Motivation: 冰川湖溃决洪水是高山地区罕见但破坏性强的灾害，现有研究受限于碎片化和单模态数据，缺乏用于预测的统一数据集。

Method: 整合三种互补数据源：Sentinel-2多光谱影像用于空间监测，NASA ITS_LIVE速度产品用于冰川运动学，MODIS地表温度记录覆盖20多年。预处理包括云掩膜、质量过滤、归一化、时间插值、数据增强和循环编码。

Conclusion: GLOFNet通过解决类别不平衡、云污染和粗分辨率等挑战，为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准测试基础。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep

Conclusion: UniFlow实现了视觉理解与生成的双赢，为通用建模提供了有效的统一分词器解决方案。

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果。

Conclusion: 提出的Diff-ABFlow框架通过扩散模型和帧事件融合，能够有效处理退化场景下的光流估计问题。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型为OOD检测提供了强大的特征表示能力。通过MoFE模块和Dynamic-β Mixup策略，可以有效解决大语义空间带来的决策边界复杂性问题，显著提升OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

Conclusion: FSVG通过简化架构和特征选择机制，为视觉定位任务提供了一个简单有效的基线方法。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSurf是一个统一的后训练范式，将监督微调(SFT)和强化学习与可验证奖励(RLVR)结合在一个阶段中，通过在RLVR过程中注入真实标签来同时提供外部监督和内部强化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法性能次优，而RLVR在处理超出模型内部知识库的任务时存在困难，需要一种能结合两者优势的统一方法。

Method: 提出ViSurf范式，分析推导SFT和RLVR目标以建立统一目标，在RLVR过程中注入真实标签，并引入三种新的奖励控制策略来稳定和优化训练过程。

Result: 在多个不同基准测试中的广泛实验表明，ViSurf优于单独的SFT、RLVR以及两阶段的SFT→RLVR方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf有效解决了SFT和RLVR各自的局限性，提供了一种统一的后训练范式，深度分析验证了其推导和设计原则的有效性。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

TL;DR: 提出了OmniQuality-R统一奖励建模框架，将多任务质量推理转化为连续可解释的奖励信号，用于策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉评估方法通常局限于单一任务，需要解决多任务质量评估的统一框架问题。

Method: 构建推理增强的奖励建模数据集，通过拒绝采样获取信息丰富的规划-推理轨迹，形成可靠的思维链数据集用于监督微调。采用组相对策略优化进行后训练，使用基于高斯的奖励支持连续分数预测。加入标准差过滤和熵门控机制来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个关键图像质量评估任务上进行评估：美学质量评估、技术质量评估和图文对齐。

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R框架能够有效处理多任务质量推理，提供连续可解释的奖励信号，并通过稳定化技术改善策略优化。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Motivation: 现有线性注意力模型由于低秩投影结构和过于均匀的注意力分布，导致表达能力显著下降，限制了模型的分类能力。

Method: 在值矩阵上附加门控局部图网络分支以增加注意力图的秩，并引入可学习的对数幂函数来降低注意力分布的熵值并锐化焦点。

Conclusion: 该混合框架有效解决了线性注意力机制的表达能力限制问题，通过增强注意力图的秩和锐化注意力分布来提升图变换器的性能。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Method: 提出运动自编码器构建结构化潜在空间，使运动因子独立表示并近似正交化，然后应用基于最优传输的流匹配和transformer预测器生成时间平滑的运动轨迹。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DEMO在视频真实感、唇音同步和运动保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将细粒度运动解耦与基于流的生成建模相结合，为可控说话人视频合成提供了强大的新范式。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,
underlining our manual specification-free definition.

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at
https://stablehdmap.github.io/.

TL;DR: FS-VFM是一个自监督预训练框架，通过3C学习目标（一致性、连贯性、对应性）结合掩码图像建模和实例判别，学习真实人脸的基础表示，并在多种人脸安全任务中展现优异的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大量未标记的真实人脸数据，学习鲁棒且可迁移的人脸表示，以提升在各种人脸安全任务中的泛化性能。

Method: 提出FS-VFM框架，采用三种学习目标：使用CRFR-P掩码策略实现区域一致性和跨区域连贯性；通过自蒸馏机制结合掩码图像建模和实例判别建立局部到全局的对应关系；使用FS-Adapter轻量适配器进行高效迁移。

Result: 在11个公开基准测试中，FS-VFM相比各种视觉基础模型（包括自然和人脸领域、全监督/弱监督/自监督范式、不同ViT规模）都表现更好，甚至超越特定任务的最优方法，FS-Adapter提供了优秀的效率-性能权衡。

Conclusion: FS-VFM能够学习到通用的人脸基础表示，在跨数据集深度伪造检测、跨域人脸反欺骗和未见扩散人脸取证等任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，为构建通用人脸安全模型提供了有效方案。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Result: 实验结果显示该方法优于现有竞争对手，消融研究验证了关键技术设计的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了视频生成模型在真实世界4D交互方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Conclusion: MSM-Seg框架通过双记忆分割范式有效整合多模态和切片间信息，使用类别无关提示提高了脑肿瘤分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Conclusion: 动作动态学习和跨时间交互对于动作理解至关重要，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to
other state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the importance of
action dynamics learning and cross-temporal interactions, laying a foundation
for future action understanding research.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Method: 分层意图感知框架：给定历史人体动态和场景上下文，首先识别潜在交互目标，然后预测细粒度未来行为；采用动态图卷积网络有效捕捉人-环境关系。

Result: 在真实世界基准测试和实时VR环境中的广泛实验表明，该方法在所有指标上均取得优越性能，能够实现预测用户行为和自适应虚拟环境的实用应用。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模认知机制成功预测人类意图和情境行为，为主动式VR系统提供了有效解决方案，能够预测用户行为并相应调整虚拟环境。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AURA首个多标注者水下视觉异常检测基准数据集，评估了四种VAD模型，发现模型性能对训练数据量和正常场景定义高度敏感，强调了软标签和共识标签的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有前景策略，但大量无事件视频使得人工检查不切实际，需要自动识别有趣或异常事件的方法。

Method: 引入AURA多标注者基准数据集，评估四种基于深度神经网络的视觉异常检测模型，采用鲁棒的帧选择策略提取有意义的视频片段。

Result: 当前VAD模型性能差异显著，对训练数据量和正常场景视觉内容变异性高度敏感，与多标注者比较显示模型表现不一致。

Conclusion: 软标签和共识标签具有重要价值，为科学探索和可扩展生物多样性监测提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠的评估指标，后处理方法对模型实际推理的保真度存在不确定性，这促使设计具有内在可解释决策过程的模型。

Method: 将两个人脸图像的相似度定义为补丁级相似度得分的总和，使用受限感受野的局部加性解释方法。

Result: 在112x112人脸图像中使用小至28x28的补丁时达到竞争性的验证性能，使用56x56补丁时超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法提供了一种内在可解释的人脸相似度度量，通过局部加性分解实现高保真度的解释，同时保持竞争性的验证性能。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

Motivation: 随着CT检查量增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生。现有3D CNN方法难以捕捉长距离依赖，而Vision Transformers需要大量领域特定预训练。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，轴向切片三元组作为节点，通过谱图卷积处理，能够推理切片间依赖关系同时保持临床部署兼容的复杂度。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学报告生成和腹部CT数据上展示了更广泛的适用性，为3D医学图像分析提供了有效的2.5D替代方案。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

TL;DR: 提出了DISC-GAN框架，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类特定训练策略实现逼真的水下图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成质量受颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象影响，不同水域具有不同的风格变化，现有生成模型难以建模这些非均匀条件。

Method: 使用K-means聚类将数据集划分为风格特定域，采用分离编码器获取风格和内容的潜在空间，通过AdaIN整合潜在表示并解码生成最终图像，每个风格聚类独立训练。

Result: 取得了最先进的性能：SSIM为0.9012，平均PSNR为32.5118 dB，FID为13.3728。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN框架能够有效合成逼真的水下图像，在多个评估指标上表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

TL;DR: 提出imHead，一种新颖的隐式3D可变形模型，能够建模表达性3D头部头像并支持面部特征的局部编辑，通过引入区域特定潜在表示实现紧凑的潜在空间和局部控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D可变形模型依赖严格拓扑结构和线性特性，难以表示复杂的全头形状。现有方法将潜在空间划分为局部组件，导致潜在维度庞大且效率低下。

Method: 保留单一紧凑的身份空间，引入中间区域特定潜在表示来实现局部编辑。使用大规模4K个不同身份的数据集进行训练。

Result: 实验证明该模型能够表示多样化的身份和表情，性能优于先前方法。同时提供了可解释的3D面部操作解决方案。

Conclusion: imHead在表达能力和局部编辑能力方面都表现出色，为大规模3D头部建模和可控编辑提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的公开分割标注对图像处理领域至关重要，特别是对于大量目标的体积图像标注既耗时又具有挑战性。

Method: 三名独立标注人员对Cell Tracking Challenge中的两个MDA231人类乳腺癌细胞序列进行了完整的3D时间推移分割标注。

Result: 创建的标注与CTC先前发布的跟踪标记一致，分割精度在标注者间变异性范围内，且比CTC自动生成的银标准更好地反映了输入图像的复杂性。

Conclusion: 该标注数据集可用于测试和训练细胞分割，或分析高度动态物体的3D形状。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在提高胸片诊断准确性方面有潜力，但存在在不同人口统计群体间性能差异的风险，可能加剧医疗保健不平等。

Method: 扩展CNN-XGBoost管道以支持多标签分类，将CNN最后一层替换为XGBoost分类器，并在不同骨干网络（DenseNet-121和ResNet-50）上验证。与对抗训练、重加权、数据增强和主动学习等传统方法进行比较。

Result: 该方法在保持或提高整体预测性能的同时改善了子群体的公平性。与XGBoost重新训练结合主动学习在所有人口统计子群体中实现了最大的偏见减少，在CheXpert和MIMIC数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床放射学中公平深度学习部署提供了一条实用有效的路径，具有模型无关设计和较低计算成本的优势。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer的3D人体网格恢复模型计算成本高、复杂度高，存在深层架构和冗余令牌问题

Method: ECLM选择性合并对MPJPE影响最小的transformer层；Mask-ToMe合并对预测贡献小的背景令牌；使用扩散解码器结合时序上下文和姿态先验

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现最高2.3倍加速，性能相比基线略有提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了计算复杂度，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著加速推理过程

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

TL;DR: EarthWhere是一个全面的视觉语言模型图像地理定位基准，包含810张全球分布的图像，评估视觉识别、逐步推理和证据使用能力。基准显示Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳，准确率56.32%，同时揭示了模型存在区域偏见等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型发展迅速，但其在开放世界条件下进行基于图像的地理定位能力尚未得到全面评估，而这一任务在现实生活中具有挑战性和需求。

Method: 构建EarthWhere基准，包含两个互补的地理定位尺度：WhereCountry（500个选择题，国家级别）和WhereStreet（310个街道级别任务，需要多步推理和可选网络搜索）。采用最终预测指标和中间推理链评分方法。

Result: 评估了13个最先进的视觉语言模型，Gemini-2.5-Pro达到最佳平均准确率56.32%，最强的开源模型GLM-4.5V达到34.71%。发现网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时不能保证性能提升，模型存在区域偏见，某些区域得分比其他区域高42.7%。

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅显示了模型的潜力，也揭示了在减轻偏见和实现鲁棒、细粒度定位方面的持续挑战。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

TL;DR: ToMCLIP是一个拓扑感知的多语言CLIP对齐框架，通过拓扑保持约束来增强多语言表示的结构一致性，提高零样本准确率和多语言检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在多语言对齐方面存在偏差，主要偏向英语，且多语言扩展方法只关注实例级对齐而忽略了共享嵌入空间的全局几何结构。

Method: 提出拓扑对齐框架ToMCLIP，应用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失，并使用图稀疏化策略来近似持久图，具有理论误差界。

Result: 实验验证表明该方法增强了多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上获得更高的零样本准确率，在xFlickr&CO上实现更强的多语言检索性能。

Conclusion: ToMCLIP不仅改进了视觉语言模型，还提供了一个将拓扑对齐融入表示学习的通用方法。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer是一个无需训练的扩散模型框架，用于在场景图像中实现灵活、高保真的文本风格迁移，支持提示引导的文本区域风格转换，同时保持文本可读性和风格一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的场景文本编辑方法通常局限于内容替换和简单样式，缺乏自由风格迁移的能力，无法实现灵活和局部化的文本风格编辑。

Method: 设计了特征注入模块利用扩散模型反演和自注意力机制有效传递风格特征；引入区域控制机制通过基于距离的变化掩码实现精确空间控制；采用基于傅里叶变换的风格增强模块增强风格丰富度。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在场景文本风格转换方面实现了卓越性能，在视觉保真度和文本保持方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SceneTextStylizer框架成功解决了场景文本灵活局部化风格编辑的挑战，实现了高质量的风格转换效果。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

advancements in virtual makeup simulation technology. Despite the progress led
by GANs, their application still encounters significant challenges, including
training instability and limited customization capabilities. Addressing these
challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model

TL;DR: FG-CLIP 2是一个双语视觉语言模型，通过细粒度监督和多种判别目标，在英语和中文上实现了先进的细粒度对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在细粒度视觉语言理解方面存在局限，特别是在非英语环境中，难以准确捕捉物体属性、空间关系和语言表达的细微差别，且双语理解能力有限。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配和长文本建模等细粒度监督方法，结合多种判别目标，并引入文本模态内对比损失来区分语义相似的描述。使用大规模英语和中文数据进行训练。

Result: 在29个数据集和8个任务上的广泛实验表明，FG-CLIP 2在两种语言上都优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过创新的细粒度对齐方法显著提升了双语视觉语言理解能力，为未来的双语细粒度对齐研究提供了有价值的模型、代码和基准测试。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DKPMV是一个仅使用多视角RGB图像进行6D姿态估计的管道，通过密集关键点级融合和三阶段渐进姿态优化策略，在纹理缺失物体上超越了现有RGB方法和多数RGB-D方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纹理缺失物体6D姿态估计中深度信息丢失的问题，当前多视角方法要么依赖深度数据，要么未能充分利用多视角几何线索，限制了性能。

Method: 设计三阶段渐进姿态优化策略，利用密集多视角关键点几何信息；通过注意力聚合和对称感知训练增强关键点网络，实现有效的密集关键点融合。

Result: 在ROBI数据集上的大量实验表明，DKPMV优于最先进的多视角RGB方法，并且在大多数情况下甚至超过了RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: 仅使用RGB图像即可实现高性能的6D姿态估计，为工业机器人应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准、实例级别的分布偏移不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题重建中的分布外数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型作为数据驱动先验在逆问题中表现良好，但存在对分布外数据产生幻觉特征的风险。现有方法需要校准数据集或提供启发式估计，无法有效检测分布偏移。

Method: 基于稳定性假设：分布内图像在随机测量变化下重建稳定，而分布外图像重建不稳定。使用重建稳定性作为分布偏移的代理指标。

Result: 在MNIST数字断层重建实验中，仅用数字"0"训练的模型在其他数字上重建时显示出更高的变异性和重建误差，验证了该指标的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成先验提供了轻量级防护机制，能在分布内情况下实现激进测量减少，同时在分布外应用时自动发出警告。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IUT-Plug模块，通过图像理解树增强现有交错视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格方面的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，限制了在复杂多模态场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 动态IUT-Plug提取模块将视觉场景解析为分层符号结构；2) 协调的叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 在基于3000个人类生成问答对的新基准测试中，IUT-Plug不仅提高了现有基准的准确性，还有效缓解了三种关键上下文漂移形式。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过显式结构化推理显著改善了视觉语言模型在多模态问答场景中的逻辑一致性和上下文保持能力。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR是一个通过可验证奖励和GRPO微调LVLMs的框架，提升图表推理的鲁棒性和可解释性，在多个基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在分布外数据上表现不佳，且生成思维链时性能下降，限制了模型的可解释性。

Method: 使用Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)结合三个可自动验证的奖励：正确图表类型分类、忠实图表表格重建、过程一致性。

Result: 在30亿参数LVLMs上，Chart-RVR在分布内外数据集上均优于标准监督微调，在六个图表推理基准测试中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR展示了可验证奖励与GRPO结合训练可靠、可解释图表推理模型的有效性。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态视频理解中，模型容易过拟合强模态，导致弱模态贡献被抑制，需要解决模态不平衡问题。

Method: MM在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；B-MM在此基础上根据模态对学习目标的相对贡献动态调整各模态的混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，这些方法能有效提升泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的MM和B-MM方法成功缓解了多模态学习中的模态不平衡问题，提高了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at
https://github.com/HJYao00/Awesome-Agentic-MLLMs.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中面临两个主要限制：难以精确控制对象布局，以及无法保持多个不同主体的身份一致性。

Method: 提出了ContextGen框架，包含两个关键技术：上下文布局锚定(CLA)机制将复合布局图像整合到生成上下文中，确保对象在期望位置；身份一致性注意力(ICA)机制利用上下文参考图像保证多个实例的身份一致性。还构建了IMIG-100K数据集。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

Motivation: 基础模型在分割任务中表现良好，但在复杂低对比度背景下难以聚焦前景区域，特别是当恶性肿瘤与正常器官相似时，上下文区分变得困难。

Method: 1) 前景感知模块放大背景与整个体积空间的差异；2) 基于小波变换的特征级频率增强模块提取判别性高频特征；3) 边缘约束模块保持分割边界的几何连续性。

Result: 在多个医学数据集上的广泛实验显示，该框架在所有指标上均表现优越，特别是在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和精细结构识别方面验证了有效性。

Conclusion: FASS框架显著增强了低对比度图像的分割能力，为更复杂多样的医学成像场景应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在明显弱点，特别是在理解图像中多个对象、属性和关系交互时表现不佳。现有方法要么资源密集，要么缺乏可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出COCO-Tree方法，通过从训练良好的大型语言模型中学习精心设计的神经符号概念树来增强VLM输出，采用波束搜索启发的推理过程。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree方法有效提升了视觉语言模型的组合推理性能，同时提供了模型预测的可解释理由。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive

TL;DR: 提出GeoVLMath模型，通过文本描述辅助线构造而非图像编辑来解决几何问题，使用强化学习框架提升图文对齐能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型在处理复杂几何问题时，辅助线的绘制具有挑战性，图像编辑模型难以精确渲染几何图形

Method: 提出强化学习框架，通过跨模态奖励评估文本描述与真实辅助线图的对齐程度，使用GRPO算法进行训练

Result: 在3B和7B规模上，GeoVLMath在辅助线推理基准测试中表现优于开源和专有的大视觉语言模型

Conclusion: 文本描述辅助线构造比图像编辑更适合大视觉语言模型，强化学习框架能有效提升图文对齐精度

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on
auxiliary-line reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: GIR-Bench是一个全面的多模态基准测试，从三个互补视角评估统一模型：理解-生成一致性、推理驱动的文本到图像生成以及多步推理编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏严格的推理中心基准来系统评估多模态模型中理解与生成的对齐及其在复杂视觉任务中的泛化潜力。

Method: 设计三个子集：GIR-Bench-UGC评估理解-生成一致性，GIR-Bench-T2I评估推理驱动的文本到图像生成，GIR-Bench-Edit评估多步推理编辑，并为每个任务设计专门评估流程。

Result: 尽管统一模型在推理驱动的视觉任务中表现更好，但理解和生成之间仍存在持续差距。

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为系统评估多模态模型提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在理解与生成对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中展现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，利用CLIP和SAM协作生成正负点提示，引导SAM专注于分割异常区域而非整个对象；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，使用混合提示与SAM的轻量级解码器级联，实现异常区域的精确分割。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进的零样本异常分割结果，在Visa数据集上F1-max和AP指标分别比现有最佳方法高出10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过有效结合CLIP和SAM的优势，成功解决了零样本异常分割任务，在工业异常检测领域取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集来支持可重现的深度学习模型开发，需要建立基准数据集来促进AI驱动的临床决策支持。

Method: 从TCIA六个数据集中收集1,029个CT扫描，使用弱监督参数搜索框架提取统一的1毫米各向同性喉部感兴趣区域，并基准测试了3D CNN、ResNet18/50/101和DenseNet121等3D深度学习架构。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT通过开源数据、预训练模型和集成可解释性工具，为喉癌AI研究提供了可重现的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations

Motivation: 现有的文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持ID和结构一致性，限制了其实际应用效果。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为ID和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反演和反向扩散过程，实现ID和属性的独立控制。

Result: 支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑，无需区域特定输入，运行速度与DDIM反演相当，实验证明其有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持身份一致性和结构一致性的同时，实现了精确的面部属性编辑，为文本引导的人脸编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Conclusion: FRANCK通过查询中心的特征增强，有效提升了DETR在目标域上的适应能力和泛化性能，为DETR基无源目标检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Conclusion: 提出的结合文本注释的符号识别框架能够更全面地理解CAD图纸，通过联合建模几何和文本信息以及显式关系建模，显著提升了符号识别的性能。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Conclusion: 未来自动驾驶车辆轨迹与环境动态演化密切相关，双向关系建模能够提升决策的适应性和准确性

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型容易受到对抗攻击，现有防御方法如对抗训练计算成本高且仅对已知攻击有效，传统净化方法图像质量下降且泛化能力不足。

Method: 使用监督扩散去噪框架，利用配对对抗-干净图像数据集微调扩散模型，加入方向性任务特定指导，并结合提示优化作为补充防御机制。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪方法为多模态防御提供了有效解决方案，有助于多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的可靠安全部署。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单张图像预测未来3D场景运动的方法，使用像素对齐的运动图表示和扩散模型来生成语义一致的3D运动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从真实世界视频中学习语义和功能上有意义的3D运动先验的挑战，以实现从单张输入图像预测未来3D场景运动。

Method: 提出像素对齐的运动图表示，从5万多个真实视频创建大规模MoMap数据库，并训练扩散模型来生成运动表示。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动，并提出了新的2D视频合成流程。

Conclusion: MoMap表示结合扩散模型能够有效学习3D运动先验，为从单张图像预测场景运动提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

*Guangzhi Sun,Yixuan Li,Xiaodong Wu,Yudong Yang,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了video-SALMONN S，首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1FPS、360p分辨率）的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过测试时训练内存模块和提示相关内存读取器实现长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展到长视频流处理，离线方法需要调整帧率，流式方法会丢失信息。需要一种能在固定内存下持续处理长视频的方法。

Method: 引入测试时训练(TTT)内存模块持续更新token表示来捕获长程依赖，替代token合并；使用提示相关内存读取器选择性检索上下文相关内容；采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化TTT模块。

Result: 在长视频基准测试(Video-MME、LVBench、VideoEvalPro)上，模型能在10k帧、100万token的多小时视频中保持高质量理解。8B参数模型在Video-MME长分割上达到74.2%总体和67.8%的准确率，优于离线和流式基线。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S是首个能在固定内存预算下处理3小时长视频的流式音频-视觉LLM，通过创新的内存管理机制实现了长视频的高质量理解。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiPro是一个处理纵向多模态医疗数据的框架，通过区域感知解耦和多时间尺度对齐，解决CXR序列冗余和与EHR数据时间不对齐的问题，在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用纵向多模态数据（EHR和连续CXR）建模疾病进展面临两个关键挑战：连续CXR序列中的冗余（静态解剖区域主导临床有意义的变化）以及稀疏、不规则成像数据与连续EHR数据之间的时间不对齐。

Method: 1. 在连续CXR中解耦静态（解剖）和动态（病理进展）特征，优先处理疾病相关变化；2. 通过局部（成对间隔级）和全局（全序列）同步，分层对齐这些静态和动态CXR特征与异步EHR数据，以建模一致的进展路径。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiPro能够有效提取时间临床动态，在疾病进展识别和通用ICU预测任务上均达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架通过解决多模态医疗数据中的关键挑战，成功实现了对疾病进展的有效建模，为临床决策提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: 提出SynTrans框架，通过从大型多模态模型转移多样化互补知识来增强现成的少样本学习器，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法利用小规模模型的语义知识来解决少样本学习中的数据稀缺问题，但这些方法会因数据简单性而引入噪声和偏见

Method: 使用CLIP作为强教师模型，少样本视觉编码器作为弱学生模型，通过无监督代理任务蒸馏语义对齐的视觉知识；包含训练自由的协同知识挖掘模块、视觉-语义桥接模块、视觉权重生成器和语义权重重构器

Result: 在四个少样本学习数据集上的实验表明，即使搭配简单的少样本视觉编码器，SynTrans也显著优于当前最先进方法

Conclusion: SynTrans框架通过有效转移大型多模态模型的多样化互补知识，成功解决了少样本学习中的数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出G2L框架，通过知识蒸馏将千亿级病理基础模型的能力迁移到仅15%参数的大型模型上，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片即可达到千亿级模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 千亿级病理基础模型虽然性能优秀，但计算成本过高，难以在实际应用中部署。需要找到一种参数和数据高效的方法来达到类似性能。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，将千亿级教师模型的能力迁移到参数更少的大型学生模型上，仅需目标癌症的1000张病理切片进行训练。

Result: 蒸馏后的大型模型不仅超越了同规模的最先进模型，在某些基准测试中甚至超过了千亿级教师模型和更大规模的模型，同时表现出更高的鲁棒性指数。

Conclusion: 提出的蒸馏方法是一种参数和数据高效的方式，可以在不产生过高计算负担的情况下，为癌症特定应用实现千亿级模型的性能水平。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散模型在文本到图像生成中的计数能力问题，发现仅通过扩大数据集和模型规模无法解决计数准确性问题，并提出了一种通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来有效控制生成对象的数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的文本到图像生成模型（如FLUX和GPT-4o）在遵循文本提示中的计数指令方面存在困难，本文旨在研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成指定数量的对象。

Method: 构建了两个互补的合成计数基准数据集：GrayCount250用于受控缩放研究，NaturalCount6包含复杂的自然场景。通过实证研究验证缩放假设，并提出通过向噪声先验注入计数感知布局信息的方法来控制生成对象的数量。

Result: 研究发现缩放假设不成立：更大的模型和数据集无法提高计数准确性。提出的方法在GrayCount250上将准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提升到86.3%，显示出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 扩散模型倾向于依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的明确计数信息，噪声先验对特定对象数量存在偏见。通过注入计数感知布局信息到噪声先验中的方法能够有效控制生成对象的数量，显著提高计数准确性。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Motivation: 传统精液分析无法评估精子DNA碎片化这一关键男性生育力参数，需要开发非破坏性的实时检测方法。

Method: 提出了一种形态学辅助的集成AI模型，结合图像处理技术和基于transformer的机器学习模型（GC-ViT），从相位对比图像预测精子DNA碎片化。

Result: 该框架能够达到60%的敏感性和75%的特异性，显示出有前景的结果。

Conclusion: 这种非破坏性方法代表了生殖医学的重要进展，能够基于DNA完整性进行实时精子选择，用于临床诊断和治疗应用。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

TL;DR: 提出MMEFnet方法，通过多流形学习和证据融合有效融合PolSAR协方差矩阵和多特征，提高分类的可靠性、鲁棒性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法忽视协方差矩阵和多特征位于不同流形的几何结构差异，且忽略不同视图的重要性差异和不确定性，导致不可靠预测

Method: 将协方差矩阵建模在HPD流形上，多特征建模在Grassmann流形上，构建两个不同的核度量学习网络学习流形表示，然后使用可信多视图证据融合估计信念质量并量化不确定性，最后基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性方面持续优于现有方法

Conclusion: MMEFnet成功将PolSAR流形学习和证据融合集成到统一架构中，实现了更可靠和可解释的分类

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

Motivation: 解决在资源有限环境中部署大型深度学习模型进行肺炎诊断的困难，提供可访问且准确的诊断方案。

Method: 构建轻量级CNN架构，包含4个卷积块，仅388,082个可训练参数；使用5,856张胸部X光图像，预处理包括图像缩放、灰度转换、像素归一化和数据增强。

Result: 在独立测试集上表现优异：准确率0.942，精确率0.92，F1分数0.96，敏感度（召回率）0.99，内存占用仅1.48MB。

Conclusion: LightPneumoNet在保持高召回率的同时实现了轻量化，可在低成本硬件上部署，为资源匮乏诊所提供可靠的计算机辅助诊断工具。

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool
to improve patient outcomes.

TL;DR: CoPRS是一个基于多模态思维链的位置感知模型，通过可微分的热图将语言推理与分割连接起来，提高了可解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理分割方法要么直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器，要么在文本中表示位置，这限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: 使用可学习的集中标记聚合图像和推理文本特征生成位置先验热图，通过轻量级解码器解码为精确掩码，建立推理与分割的直接连接。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超过最佳报告指标，在验证和测试集上性能达到或优于先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: 热图质量强烈影响掩码质量，支持推理输出与下游掩码生成之间的一致关联，该范式在桥接推理与分割方面具有实用性。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

TL;DR: 提出DocReward文档奖励模型，专注于评估文档的结构和样式质量，解决了现有代理工作流程主要关注文本质量而忽视视觉结构和样式的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理工作流程主要关注文本质量，忽视了文档的视觉结构和样式，这对于可读性和参与度至关重要。缺乏合适的奖励模型来指导代理工作流程生成具有更强结构和样式质量的文档。

Method: 构建多领域数据集DocPair，包含117K对文档，涵盖32个领域和267种文档类型，每对包含内容和相同但结构和样式不同的高专业度和低专业度文档。使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型来评分文档。

Result: DocReward在准确性上分别超过GPT-4o和GPT-5 30.6和19.4个百分点。在文档生成的外部评估中，DocReward的胜率达到60.8%，显著高于GPT-5的37.7%。

Conclusion: DocReward能够有效评估文档的专业性，并在文本质量无关的方式下指导生成代理产生人类偏好的文档，证明了其在文档生成任务中的实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PICO是一个新颖的跨模态对齐框架，通过抑制风格信息干扰来提升语义对齐效果，在各种基准测试中比现有方法提升5.2%-14.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了非语义信息（风格信息）的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。需要分离语义和风格信息，但现有方法基于特征列区分无法表示两者复杂的耦合关系。

Method: 提出PICO框架，量化每个特征列表示语义信息的概率，并将其作为嵌入交互的权重。采用原型迭代构建方法确保语义概率的可靠性，核心是基于性能反馈的加权函数，理论证明该函数能为带来更高性能提升的原型分配更高权重。

Result: 在各种基准测试和模型骨干上的广泛实验表明PICO的优越性，比最先进方法提升5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过有效抑制风格干扰，显著提升了跨模态对齐性能，证明了语义-风格分离策略的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

Abstract: Sign languages serve as essential communication systems for individuals with
hearing and speech impairments. However, digital linguistic dataset resources
for underrepresented sign languages, such as Nepali Sign Language (NSL), remain
scarce. This study introduces the first benchmark dataset for NSL, consisting
of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the
dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%,
respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional
neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource
settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning
approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning
and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个多模态自动化尺度条检测和提取框架，结合目标检测、文本识别和LLM代理，用于SEM图像的尺度条分析，显著提高效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEM图像中的尺度条确定目前主要依赖人工操作，既耗时又容易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提高分析效率和准确性。

Method: 四阶段框架：1)自动数据集生成模型合成多样化SEM图像；2)尺度条目标检测；3)混合OCR系统进行信息提取；4)LLM代理分析和验证结果准确性。

Result: 目标检测精度达100%，召回率95.8%，mAP@0.5为99.2%；混合OCR系统在Auto-DG数据集上达到89%精度、65%召回率和75% F1分数，优于主流独立引擎。

Conclusion: 基于LLM代理的自动化方法显著提高了SEM图像中尺度条检测和提取的效率和准确性，为显微分析提供了有价值的工具，推动了科学成像领域的发展。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在日常文化知识方面的鲁棒性，涵盖语言改写和视觉模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在全球部署，评估其对文化知识的理解能力变得至关重要，但现有评估主要关注静态回忆或孤立的视觉基础，未能测试模型是否具备稳健和可迁移的文化理解能力。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集构建了313个文化基础问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种对齐的多选题格式：文本基线（地区→实体）、倒置文本变体（实体→地区）和带生成图像的VQA版本。

Result: 当前VLM在文化知识方面表现出显著脆弱性，在语言改写下性能下降，视觉线索虽能提升性能但跨模态一致性低，特别是在资源较少地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，揭示了现有模型的局限性，并指导开发更具文化能力的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Motivation: 解决沙特手语翻译的挑战，特别是面对独特特征如面部遮盖等问题，探索利用大规模美国手语数据来提升沙特手语翻译效果。

Method: 使用T5模型进行沙特手语翻译，比较在YouTubeASL数据集上预训练的模型与直接在SSL数据集上训练的模型性能差异。

Result: 预训练在YouTubeASL上的模型性能显著优于直接训练的模型，BLEU-4指标提升约3倍，证明了跨语言迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: 利用大规模ASL数据进行预训练可以有效提升SSL翻译性能，为开发更有效的手语翻译系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our

*Samer Al-Hamadani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过成本效益分析比较了监督学习检测器(YOLO)和零样本视觉语言模型(Gemini Flash 2.5)，建立了架构选择的定量平衡点阈值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督检测需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM无需标注但精度较低，需要系统比较两者的成本效益。

Method: 在1000张分层COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像上进行系统评估，结合详细的总拥有成本建模，分析准确率和成本效益。

Result: 监督YOLO准确率91.2%，零样本Gemini准确率68.5%，但Gemini在100,000次推理中每次正确检测成本仅为$0.00050，远低于YOLO的$0.143。监督YOLO仅在超过5500万次推理时成本效益才超过Gemini。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署量、类别稳定性、预算约束和精度要求，而非纯粹的技术性能指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FlexAC框架，用于在多模态大语言模型中灵活控制联想推理强度，平衡忠实性和创造性需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法缺乏调节联想推理强度的灵活性，限制了模型在事实性和创造性场景中的适应性。

Method: 通过分析MLLM内部机制，发现中层在塑造联想倾向中的关键作用，提出FlexAC框架：诱导幻觉引导的中间表示来编码联想方向，构建有效的联想引导向量，并自适应校准强度以平衡创造性和输出稳定性。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，在CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlexAC框架有效实现了对MLLM联想推理的灵活控制，显著提升了模型的创造性和事实准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

Motivation: 随着儿童在线媒体消费的增长，需要数据驱动工具来帮助教育工作者筛选适合幼儿的教育内容。

Method: 采用基于类别原型的监督对比学习方法，结合多模态transformer网络捕捉视频中视觉和音频线索的交互，处理细粒度多标签分类问题。

Result: 在APPROVE数据集（193小时专家标注视频，19个类别）上，该方法在Youtube-8M和COIN等基准测试中优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态对比学习方法能有效检测视频中的教育内容，为筛选适合幼儿的教育视频提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究面部表情动态成分是否包含足够的身份信息，独立于静态面部外观，这对于理解社交感知和临床评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用FLAME 3D可变形模型分离面部形状和表情动态，提取纯表情和下颌参数，采用Conformer模型和监督对比学习进行身份识别。

Result: 在CANDOR数据集上实现61.14%的1,429类分类准确率，引入漂移噪声比(DNR)量化形状-表情分离的可靠性，发现DNR与识别性能呈强负相关。

Conclusion: 面部动态携带强烈的身份特征，不稳定的形状估计会损害动态识别性能，揭示了对话面部动态中的个体特异性签名。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Motivation: 现有ControlNet倾向于复制原始训练分布，限制了数据增强效果。需要利用未标记领域数据来扩展训练分布，特别是在存在领域偏移的场景中

Method: 在控制机制中引入不确定性概念，结合来自未标记数据集的不确定性控制和来自标记数据集的语义控制，生成目标域的高不确定性标注数据

Result: 在视网膜OCT图像和交通场景实验中，该方法显著改善了分割结果，无需额外监督即可处理领域偏移问题

Conclusion: 不确定性引导方法优于风格迁移，能够实现任意领域偏移而无需严格学习图像风格，为跨域分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进的跳跃连接框架有效提升了医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么只关注错误修正，要么需要大量重新训练成本，难以实现灵活编辑。图像分类中的编辑研究也相对有限。

Method: 引入Class Vectors概念，在微调过程中捕获类别特定的表示调整。这些向量在潜在空间中解耦每个类别的适应，可以通过沿向量引导潜在特征或映射到权重空间来更新决策边界。

Result: Class Vectors能够捕获每个类别的语义偏移，其固有的线性和正交性支持通过简单的类别算术实现高效、灵活的高级概念编辑。

Conclusion: Class Vectors在遗忘学习、环境适应、对抗防御和对抗触发器优化等应用中验证了其实用性，为图像分类器提供了灵活的编辑能力。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了HaDola框架，通过人类不确定性感知的数据选择和自动标注，减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖，使视觉语言模型更准确且校准更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据集存在人类不确定性（HU）——人类标注信心的变化，但标准监督微调仅优化最频繁标签，忽略了HU分布。需要研究HU如何影响SFT以及如何有效利用HU进行训练。

Method: HaDola框架包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，通过迭代识别有害样本、优先处理信息丰富的样本，并从少量种子数据（5%数据）进行引导。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上的广泛实验表明，HaDola在使用较少训练数据的情况下，持续匹配或优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 在监督微调中显式建模人类不确定性至关重要，更好地利用HU比单纯扩大数据集规模更有效。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

Abstract: In recent years, while cloud-based MLLMs such as QwenVL, InternVL, GPT-4o,
Gemini, and Claude Sonnet have demonstrated outstanding performance with
enormous model sizes reaching hundreds of billions of parameters, they

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD检测分数，通过最大化其下界(EBM)同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力，在挑战性基准测试中表现优于现有方法10%-25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中视觉语言模型(VLMs)会同时遇到分布内(ID)和分布外(OOD)数据，其中OOD数据包含协变量偏移和语义偏移，需要提升模型对协变量偏移OOD数据的泛化能力，同时有效检测开放集语义偏移OOD类别。

Method: 受闭集数据在重新对齐视觉-语言模态时能量显著变化的启发，提出ΔEnergy OOD分数，并通过下界最大化(EBM)同时优化OOD检测和泛化，构建统一的微调框架。

Result: 在挑战性OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有方法，AUROC指标提升10%到25%。

Conclusion: ΔEnergy分数和EBM方法为视觉语言模型提供了同时提升OOD检测和泛化能力的有效解决方案，理论分析和实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Motivation: 由于难以在生成过程中区分物理正确性和视觉外观，准确评估视频扩散模型的直觉物理理解能力仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用去噪目标作为ELBO似然替代，在精心策划的有效-无效视频对数据集上区分物理有效和不可能的视频。

Result: 提出的评估指标PPE与人类偏好强对齐，优于最先进的评估器基线。当前模型在复杂混沌动力学方面仍有困难，但随着模型容量和推理设置的扩展，物理理解能力呈现明显改善趋势。

Conclusion: LikePhys方法有效评估了视频扩散模型的直觉物理理解能力，揭示了模型设计和推理设置对物理理解的影响，以及跨物理定律的领域特定能力变化。

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Motivation: 解决基于草图的3D重建中草图输入抽象稀疏、缺乏足够语义和几何信息的问题

Method: 两阶段生成方法：1）通过草图到图像转换进行语义桥接丰富稀疏草图表示；2）引入对称约束作为几何先验，利用日常物体的结构规律性

Result: 在主流草图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在Chamfer距离、Earth Mover距离和F-Score方面优于现有基于草图的3D重建方法

Conclusion: 验证了所提出的语义桥接和对称感知设计的有效性

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了SAR影像预处理、洪水制图和水深估计方法的选择及其超参数对洪水模拟结果的影响，强调采用集成方法考虑整个处理流程的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水制图和水深估计对校准和验证水力模型至关重要，但不同方法选择和超参数设置会显著影响结果准确性，需要系统评估这些不确定性。

Method: 使用SAR影像，评估了多种预处理（特别是斑点噪声抑制）、洪水制图和水深估计方法，考虑不同步骤方法选择和超参数的影响，采用集成方法分析预处理图像、洪水图和水深场的变异性。

Result: 斑点滤波器的选择会改变洪水范围估计达数平方公里；监督方法优于无监督方法，但调优的无监督方法（如局部阈值或变化检测）可获得相当结果；预处理和洪水制图步骤的复合不确定性导致水深场估计高度可变。

Conclusion: 洪水制图中方法选择影响最大，水深估计中洪水图输入和超参数影响最显著；应采用集成方法考虑整个处理流程的不确定性，而非依赖单一配置。

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative

algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态方法面临特征对齐挑战，而局部特征提取对于复杂3D检测任务可能过于简化。需要更有效的方法来捕捉3D空间中的表面关系。

Method: 使用KNN和PCA计算每个体素的法向量作为局部特征，提出法向量密度采样和FOV感知分箱采样两种策略，并采用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，NV3D在汽车和骑行者检测上表现优异：无采样时达到86.60%和80.18% mAP，比基线提升2.61%和4.23%；使用采样后仍达到85.54% mAP，比基线高1.56%。

Conclusion: 法向量特征能有效捕捉表面与目标实体的关系，提出的采样策略可显著减少计算量而不牺牲性能，特别适用于具有空间形状的目标检测。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Conclusion: 统一建模方法能够诱导正向迁移并提高整体性能，为SVG处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Motivation: 现有自动概念发现方法往往无法将提取的概念与模型真实决策过程对齐，损害了解释的忠实性。

Method: 在非负矩阵分解基础上加入KL散度正则化项，在概念学习中融入分类器监督，强制预测一致性。

Result: 在ImageNet、COCO和CelebA数据集上的系统评估表明，FACE在忠实性和稀疏性指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FACE框架通过理论保证和实验验证，能够提供更忠实的概念解释，弥合了低层特征与高层语义之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Result: 在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上一致优于所有现有最先进方法

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时增强局部特征粒度和全局上下文理解，有效缩小了视觉特征与分子信号之间的模态差距

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at

Conclusion: 推理型IQA模型的泛化能力源于将冗余视觉表示转换为紧凑的跨域对齐文本表示，而RALI算法通过直接对齐这种表示，在保持性能的同时显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters

Conclusion: 多视角一致的材料推断和物理环境建模是学习准确反射的关键，能够显著提升高斯泼溅的渲染质量。

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

Conclusion: LM-EEC框架通过有效的特征融合和长期记忆管理，成功解决了自我-外部视图对应任务的核心挑战，为智能助手提供精确视觉指导。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AIS监控系统的局限性，通过非合作卫星图像和AIS数据融合来识别黑暗船只，验证合作交通，提升内河航道监控能力。

Method: 使用YOLO v11目标检测模型从卫星图像中检测船舶，结合AIS轨迹数据进行数据融合，开发了包含4550个实例的标注数据集。

Result: 船舶分类F1分数95.8%，驳船覆盖检测91.6%，运行状态分类99.4%，方向性准确率93.8%，驳船计数MAE为2.4，空间可转移性准确率高达98%。

Conclusion: 卫星传感与AIS融合方法可行，支持近实时船队盘点、异常检测和内河航道监控，未来将扩展数据集、纳入时间跟踪和多模态深度学习。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外与可见光图像融合方法假设高质量输入，在处理退化图像时依赖手动切换预处理技术，导致退化处理与图像融合解耦，性能显著下降。

Method: 使用特定提示退化耦合提取器(SPDCE)实现模态特定的退化感知，联合建模退化抑制和模态内特征提取；并行使用联合提示退化耦合融合(JPDCF)实现跨模态退化感知，将残差退化过滤与互补跨模态特征融合耦合。

Conclusion: VGDCFusion通过紧密耦合退化建模与融合过程，有效解决了退化场景下的红外与可见光图像融合问题，取得了优越性能。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过视图对齐增强3D高斯泼溅几何表示的方法，结合边缘感知图像线索、可见性感知光度对齐、法线约束和深度图像特征嵌入，在表面重建和新视角合成方面达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅虽然在新视角合成方面表现出色，但其表面重建能力尚未充分探索。由于高斯的离散和非结构化特性，仅基于图像渲染损失的监督往往导致几何不准确和多视图对齐不一致。

Method: 1) 在渲染损失中融入边缘感知图像线索以改善表面边界描绘；2) 引入可见性感知光度对齐损失来强制多视图几何一致性；3) 结合法线约束来细化高斯空间方向；4) 利用深度图像特征嵌入增强跨视图一致性。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过视图对齐方法显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的几何表示能力，在保持高效渲染的同时实现了更准确的表面重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Result: 在标准法线积分基准测试中达到最先进结果，仅需几秒钟，在大分辨率法线图上比像素级方法快一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法通过组件级优化显著提高了法线积分的计算效率，同时保持了重建质量。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

TL;DR: Situat3DChange是一个大规模3D数据集，支持三种情境感知变化理解任务，包含121K问答对、36K变化描述和17K重排指令。该数据集利用11K人类观察构建共享心智模型，并提出SCReasoner方法进行高效点云比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D数据集和评估基准往往只关注动态场景或动态情境的孤立方面，导致理解不完整。为了克服这些限制，需要构建一个能够全面理解动态环境中情境变化的数据集。

Method: 利用11K人类观察构建共享心智模型，整合自我中心和他者中心视角以及分类和坐标空间关系，使用LLM支持情境变化理解。提出SCReasoner方法，一种高效的3D MLLM方法，能够以最小的参数开销进行有效的点云比较。

Result: 在Situat3DChange任务上的综合评估显示了MLLMs在动态场景和情境理解方面的进展和局限性。数据缩放和跨领域迁移的额外实验表明，使用Situat3DChange作为训练数据集对MLLMs具有任务无关的有效性。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange数据集和SCReasoner方法为动态3D环境中的情境感知变化理解提供了重要基础，推动了MLLMs在动态场景理解方面的发展，并展示了其作为训练数据的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决盲人和低视力人群在极端或复杂环境中行走辅助的挑战，因为现有系统缺乏整体场景理解能力。

Method: 构建mmWalk多模态数据集，包含多视角传感器和面向无障碍的特征；生成mmWalkVQA视觉问答基准；评估最先进视觉语言模型的零样本和少样本性能。

Conclusion: mmWalk数据集能有效推进多模态行走辅助技术的发展，为盲人和低视力人群提供更好的户外导航支持。

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant
challenge for people with blindness or low vision (BLV), largely due to the
lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing
multi-modal walking assistance.

Motivation: DiT模型内部特征图中存在大规模激活现象，但其功能尚未被充分理解，需要系统研究这些激活在视觉生成中的作用。

Method: 通过分析大规模激活的分布特性，提出细节引导(DG)策略，通过破坏大规模激活构建退化的细节缺失模型，并用其引导原始网络提升细节合成质量。

Result: DG方法能显著提升各种预训练DiT模型（如SD3、SD3.5、Flux）的细粒度细节质量，且能与CFG无缝集成。

Conclusion: 大规模激活在DiT模型中主要负责局部细节合成，基于此提出的DG方法能有效提升生成图像的细节保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像和视频理解上表现优异，但在全方位图像理解方面的能力尚未充分探索，需要专门基准测试来评估和提升。

Method: 构建包含2,000张全方位图像和4,000个问答对的ODI-Bench基准，涵盖10个细粒度任务；提出Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理结合文本和视觉线索来增强模型理解能力。

Result: 实验显示当前MLLMs在全方位图像理解上仍有困难，而Omni-CoT方法能显著提升模型在全方位环境中的理解能力。

Conclusion: 全方位图像理解是MLLMs的重要挑战领域，ODI-Bench为评估提供了标准，Omni-CoT为性能提升提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential
samples for targeted performance.

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

TL;DR: MS-Mix是一种针对多模态情感分析的自适应情感敏感增强框架，通过情感感知样本选择、情感强度引导的混合比例计算和情感对齐损失，解决了传统Mixup方法在多模态场景下导致的标签模糊和语义不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析面临标注数据稀缺的问题，而传统的Mixup增强方法直接应用于多模态场景会放大标签模糊性和语义不一致性，因为缺乏情感感知的混合机制。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六个最先进的骨干网络上进行的广泛实验表明，MS-Mix始终优于现有方法，为鲁棒的多模态情感增强建立了新标准。

Conclusion: MS-Mix通过情感感知的混合机制有效解决了多模态情感分析中的数据增强问题，显著提升了模型性能，为多模态情感分析的数据增强提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出ACE-G方法，通过将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，显著提升了视觉重定位的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归方法在训练视图和查询图像成像条件差异较大时泛化能力不足，因为其设计上会过度拟合训练视图。

Method: 将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，在数万个场景上预训练变换器，使其能够从映射图像泛化到未见过的查询图像。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的重定位数据集上，ACE-G方法显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了有吸引力的计算开销。

Conclusion: 通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，并利用大规模预训练，ACE-G成功克服了传统场景坐标回归方法的泛化限制。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

TL;DR: ExpVid是首个针对科学实验视频的多模态大语言模型基准测试，通过三级任务层次评估模型在细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试忽略了真实实验室工作的细粒度和长时程特性，无法准确评估MLLMs在科学发现中的实际能力。

Method: 从同行评审的视频出版物中构建ExpVid基准，采用三级任务层次：细粒度感知、程序理解和科学推理，结合自动化生成和多学科专家验证的视觉中心标注流程。

Result: 评估19个领先MLLMs发现，它们在粗粒度识别上表现良好，但在区分细节、跟踪状态变化和连接实验程序与科学结果方面存在困难，专有模型与开源模型之间存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: ExpVid不仅提供了诊断工具，还为开发能够在科学实验中成为可信赖伙伴的MLLMs制定了路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

TL;DR: LLF-LUT++是一种金字塔网络，通过拉普拉斯金字塔分解与重建整合全局和局部操作，在保持高性能的同时实现高分辨率图像的快速处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有照片增强方法要么性能强大但无法部署在边缘设备上，要么计算效率高但实际应用性能不足，需要平衡性能与效率。

Method: 使用图像自适应3D LUT进行全局色调调整，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器提取权重，并应用局部拉普拉斯滤波器细化高频细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K分辨率图像处理仅需13ms，在两个基准数据集上表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++成功实现了高性能与高效率的平衡，为照片增强提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Conclusion: IVEBench解决了现有基准的局限性，为指令引导视频编辑提供了系统、全面的评估框架。

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

TL;DR: PhySIC是一个从单张RGB图像重建度量准确的人类和场景的框架，通过物理约束解决深度模糊、遮挡和接触不一致问题，显著提升了重建精度和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理深度模糊、遮挡和物理接触不一致方面存在困难，限制了从单张图像重建度量准确的人类和场景的能力。

Method: 从粗粒度单目深度和人体估计开始，进行遮挡感知修复，融合可见深度与未缩放几何体构建度量支架，合成缺失支撑表面，并通过置信度加权优化联合执行深度对齐、接触先验、穿透避免和2D重投影一致性。

Result: PhySIC显著优于基线方法，将平均每顶点场景误差从641mm降至227mm，PA-MPJPE减半至42mm，接触F1从0.09提升至0.51，且能自然处理多人交互。

Conclusion: PhySIC通过将单张图像转换为物理合理的3D人-场景对，推进了可扩展的3D场景理解，实现了高效且物理可信的重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the
InfiniHumanGen models at https://yuxuan-xue.com/infini-human.

Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖对象特定先验（如CAD模型），要么由于位姿-形状纠缠和多阶段流程而泛化能力有限，需要一种能同时预测位姿、尺寸和形状的统一框架。

Method: 使用Transformer编码器融合视觉基础模型的密集2D特征和部分3D点云，采用专家混合增强，并行解码器分别处理位姿-尺寸估计和形状重建，仅使用合成数据训练。

Result: 在SOPE、ROPE、ObjaversePose和HANDAL四个基准测试中，涵盖300多个类别，实现了最先进的精度，对未见真实世界对象表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，推理速度达28FPS。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解设立了新标准，展示了强大的跨类别泛化能力，无需类别标签即可实时运行。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

TL;DR: 该论文提出用表示自编码器(RAE)替代传统VAE作为扩散变换器的潜空间编码器，解决了VAE在架构、信息容量和表示质量方面的限制，并通过理论分析和实验验证实现了更好的生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散变换器依赖的VAE编码器存在架构过时、潜空间维度低、表示质量弱等问题，限制了生成质量。需要探索更先进的表示编码器来提升性能。

Method: 使用预训练的表示编码器(如DINO、SigLIP、MAE)配合训练的解码器构建表示自编码器(RAE)，并针对高维潜空间设计了轻量级的DDT头来优化扩散变换器的训练效率。

Result: 在ImageNet上取得了显著成果：无引导时256x256分辨率FID为1.51，有引导时256x256和512x512分辨率FID均为1.13，收敛速度更快且无需辅助表示对齐损失。

Conclusion: 表示自编码器(RAE)相比传统VAE具有明显优势，应该成为扩散变换器训练的新标准配置。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

Result: 在基准图像分类数据集上优于传统CNN、贝叶斯神经网络和拓扑CNN，特别是在训练数据有限或损坏时表现更好，能更好地识别分布外数据。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法在图像分类中具有更高效和鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注模型设计，但全景图像生成质量不佳的主要原因是缺乏大规模、高质量的真实世界全景数据。

Method: 在图像级别通过透视图像引导和全景细化引入跨域知识，在token级别应用混合监督，包括循环填充、偏航损失和立方体损失等模块。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外扩任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在11个定量指标上实现了更好的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据中心的视角和混合训练策略，有效提升了全景图像生成的几何保真度和照片真实感。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跟踪器和视频生成器解决密切相关的问题：前者分析运动，后者合成运动。这种联系使得预训练视频扩散模型能够通过视觉标记点来进行零样本点跟踪。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色的标记，然后从中等噪声级别重新生成视频的其余部分，从而传播标记跨帧。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记在反事实生成中保持可见。

Result: 通过多个图像条件视频扩散模型的实验发现，这种"涌现"跟踪方法优于先前的零样本方法，能够持续通过遮挡，性能与专门的自监督模型相当。

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型能够有效执行零样本点跟踪任务，展示了生成模型在运动分析任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions
about tabular data, often accompanied by additional contexts such as text
passages. The task spans diverse settings, varying in table representation,
question/answer complexity, modality involved, and domain. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to substantial progress in
TQA, the field still lacks a systematic organization and understanding of task
formulations, core challenges, and methodological trends, particularly in light
of emerging research directions such as reinforcement learning. This survey
addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive and structured overview of TQA
research with a focus on LLM-based methods. We provide a comprehensive
categorization of existing benchmarks and task setups. We group current
modeling strategies according to the challenges they target, and analyze their
strengths and limitations. Furthermore, we highlight underexplored but timely
topics that have not been systematically covered in prior research. By unifying
disparate research threads and identifying open problems, our survey offers a
consolidated foundation for the TQA community, enabling a deeper understanding
of the state of the art and guiding future developments in this rapidly
evolving area.

### [223] [Emotionally Charged, Logically Blurred: AI-driven Emotional Framing Impairs Human Fallacy Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09695)
*Yanran Chen,Lynn Greschner,Roman Klinger,Michael Klenk,Steffen Eger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM驱动的情绪框架会降低人类对逻辑谬误的检测能力，平均F1分数下降14.5%。当人们感知到愉悦情绪时，谬误检测表现更好；而恐惧、悲伤等情绪会显著提高论证的说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 逻辑谬误在公共传播中很常见，可能误导受众。尽管谬误论证缺乏合理性，但由于说服力具有主观性，它们仍然可能显得有说服力。本研究旨在探索情绪框架如何与谬误和说服力相互作用。

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLM)系统性地改变谬误论证中的情绪诉求，同时保持其逻辑结构不变。对8个LLM进行基准测试，然后使用最佳模型为人类研究生成刺激材料。

Result: LLM驱动的情绪框架使人类谬误检测的F1分数平均下降14.5%。当感知到愉悦情绪时，人类在谬误检测方面表现更好；恐惧、悲伤等情绪与显著更高的说服力相关。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了AI驱动的情绪操纵在谬误论证背景下的潜在影响，强调了需要关注LLM在增强谬误论证说服力方面的能力。

Abstract: Logical fallacies are common in public communication and can mislead
audiences; fallacious arguments may still appear convincing despite lacking
soundness, because convincingness is inherently subjective. We present the
first computational study of how emotional framing interacts with fallacies and
convincingness, using large language models (LLMs) to systematically change
emotional appeals in fallacious arguments. We benchmark eight LLMs on injecting
emotional appeal into fallacious arguments while preserving their logical
structures, then use the best models to generate stimuli for a human study. Our
results show that LLM-driven emotional framing reduces human fallacy detection
in F1 by 14.5% on average. Humans perform better in fallacy detection when
perceiving enjoyment than fear or sadness, and these three emotions also
correlate with significantly higher convincingness compared to neutral or other
emotion states. Our work has implications for AI-driven emotional manipulation
in the context of fallacious argumentation.

*Shin-nosuke Ishikawa,Masato Todo,Taiki Ogihara,Hirotsugu Ohba*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型在识别数字序列规律时会产生荒谬模式，即使在随机生成的数列中也会过度识别不存在的模式，这揭示了LLMs在逻辑一致性方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型的逻辑一致性和自洽性，因为现有方法（如检索增强生成和AI代理框架）都依赖于这些特性，需要识别LLMs在逻辑推理方面的失败案例。

Method: 通过让LLMs解释各种整数序列的模式进行实验，包括算术序列、几何序列和随机生成的整数序列，测试了OpenAI o3、o4-mini和Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview Thinking等多步推理模型。

Result: 模型在算术和几何序列中能成功识别正确模式，但在分析随机生成的序列时频繁过度识别与给定数字不一致的模式，即使使用链式思维推理机制也存在此问题。

Conclusion: LLMs倾向于感知不存在模式的现象可类比为AI模型的"部落偶像"，这凸显了它们在需要逻辑推理的应用任务中的潜在局限性。

Abstract: We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.

*Xiaonan Si,Meilin Zhu,Simeng Qin,Lijia Yu,Lijun Zhang,Shuaitong Liu,Xinfeng Li,Ranjie Duan,Yang Liu,Xiaojun Jia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SeCon-RAG框架，通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突消除机制来防御RAG系统中的语料库污染攻击，在保持有用知识的同时提高生成鲁棒性和输出可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统防御方法通常采用激进的过滤策略，导致有价值信息的丢失和生成可靠性的降低。需要一种既能防御污染攻击又能保留有用知识的方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用EIRE指导的语义和聚类联合过滤，提取实体、意图和关系进行语义相关性评分；第二阶段使用EIRE指导的冲突感知过滤模块，分析查询、候选答案和检索知识之间的语义一致性。

Result: 在多种LLM和数据集上的广泛实验表明，SeCon-RAG显著优于最先进的防御方法，在生成鲁棒性和输出可信度方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: SeCon-RAG通过两阶段语义过滤和冲突消除机制，有效缓解了冲突污染，同时保留了有用知识，为可信RAG系统提供了有效的防御解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems enhance large language models
(LLMs) with external knowledge but are vulnerable to corpus poisoning and
contamination attacks, which can compromise output integrity. Existing defenses
often apply aggressive filtering, leading to unnecessary loss of valuable
information and reduced reliability in generation. To address this problem, we
propose a two-stage semantic filtering and conflict-free framework for
trustworthy RAG. In the first stage, we perform a joint filter with semantic
and cluster-based filtering which is guided by the Entity-intent-relation
extractor (EIRE). EIRE extracts entities, latent objectives, and entity
relations from both the user query and filtered documents, scores their
semantic relevance, and selectively adds valuable documents into the clean
retrieval database. In the second stage, we proposed an EIRE-guided
conflict-aware filtering module, which analyzes semantic consistency between
the query, candidate answers, and retrieved knowledge before final answer
generation, filtering out internal and external contradictions that could
mislead the model. Through this two-stage process, SeCon-RAG effectively
preserves useful knowledge while mitigating conflict contamination, achieving
significant improvements in both generation robustness and output
trustworthiness. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and datasets
demonstrate that the proposed SeCon-RAG markedly outperforms state-of-the-art
defense methods.

### [226] [ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09711)
*Wenbin Guo,Xin Wang,Jiaoyan Chen,Lingbing Guo,Zhao Li,Zirui Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ReaLM是一个新颖的框架，通过残差向量量化将知识图谱嵌入转化为LLM可处理的离散代码序列，解决了KG嵌入与LLM标记空间不匹配的问题，实现了结构化知识与语言模型的有效融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的知识图谱补全方法难以充分利用结构化语义表示，因为预训练KG模型的连续嵌入空间与LLM的离散标记空间存在根本性不匹配，这阻碍了有效的语义迁移并限制了性能。

Method: 使用残差向量量化机制将预训练KG嵌入离散化为紧凑代码序列，并将其作为可学习标记集成到LLM词汇表中；同时引入本体引导的类别约束来增强语义一致性，基于类别级兼容性优化实体预测。

Result: 在两个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验表明，ReaLM实现了最先进的性能，证实了其在将结构化知识与大规模语言模型对齐方面的有效性。

Conclusion: ReaLM通过桥接KG嵌入与LLM标记化之间的差距，成功实现了符号知识与上下文知识的无缝融合，为知识图谱补全提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.

*Shiyuan Guo,Henry Sleight,Fabien Roger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现AI模型在加密推理中存在不对称性：虽然能准确翻译加密文本，但在加密推理中准确率显著下降，特别是对于不常见的密码。这为防范CoT监控规避提供了指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI代理的广泛采用，检测有害AI行为变得重要。CoT监控是检测对抗攻击和AI错位的方法，但攻击者可能通过加密推理来规避监控。

Method: 测试28种不同密码，对最多10个模型进行微调和提示，使其在密码中进行推理。使用数学问题作为推理能力的代理指标。

Result: 模型在加密推理中准确率显著下降，尽管能准确翻译加密文本。前沿模型对不常见密码推理困难，加密推理能力与预训练数据中密码流行度相关。

Conclusion: 当前模型使用加密推理规避CoT监控可能无效，研究为约束未来前沿模型开发此能力提供了指导。

Abstract: Detecting harmful AI actions is important as AI agents gain adoption.
Chain-of-thought (CoT) monitoring is one method widely used to detect
adversarial attacks and AI misalignment. However, attackers and misaligned
models might evade CoT monitoring through ciphered reasoning: reasoning hidden
in encrypted, translated, or compressed text. To assess this risk, we test
whether models can perform ciphered reasoning. For each of 28 different
ciphers, we fine-tune and prompt up to 10 models to reason in that cipher. We
measure model accuracy on math problems as a proxy for reasoning ability.
Across the models we test, we find an asymmetry: model accuracy can drop
significantly when reasoning in ciphered text, even though models demonstrate
comprehension of ciphered text by being able to translate it accurately to
English. Even frontier models struggle with lesser-known ciphers, although they
can reason accurately in well-known ciphers like rot13. We show that ciphered
reasoning capability correlates with cipher prevalence in pretraining data. We
also identify scaling laws showing that ciphered reasoning capability improves
slowly with additional fine-tuning data. Our work suggests that evading CoT
monitoring using ciphered reasoning may be an ineffective tactic for current
models and offers guidance on constraining the development of this capability
in future frontier models.

*Haoran Sun,Zekun Zhang,Shaoning Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好感知记忆更新机制(PAMU)，通过结合滑动窗口平均和指数移动平均来动态优化LLM代理的长期记忆表示，显著提升了长期对话中的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长期记忆方法在记忆更新方面存在不足，缺乏根据用户行为和上下文变化动态优化偏好记忆表示的机制。

Method: PAMU机制整合滑动窗口平均(SW)和指数移动平均(EMA)，构建融合的偏好感知表示，捕捉短期波动和长期用户倾向。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集的五个任务场景实验中，该机制显著提升了五个基线的LLM输出质量。

Conclusion: PAMU机制在长期对话中有效提升了LLM代理的推理能力，验证了动态记忆更新的重要性。

Abstract: One of the key factors influencing the reasoning capabilities of LLM-based
agents is their ability to leverage long-term memory. Integrating long-term
memory mechanisms allows agents to make informed decisions grounded in
historical interactions. While recent advances have significantly improved the
storage and retrieval components, by encoding memory into dense vectors for
similarity search or organizing memory as structured knowledge graphs most
existing approaches fall short in memory updating. In particular, they lack
mechanisms for dynamically refining preference memory representations in
response to evolving user behaviors and contexts. To address this gap, we
propose a Preference-Aware Memory Update Mechanism (PAMU) that enables dynamic
and personalized memory refinement. By integrating sliding window averages (SW)
with exponential moving averages (EMA), PAMU constructs a fused
preference-aware representation that captures both short-term fluctuations and
long-term user tendencies. We conduct experiments on five task scenarios of the
LoCoMo dataset, and the results show that our mechanism can significantly
improve the output quality of LLM in five baselines, validating its
effectiveness in long-term conversations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化简历信息提取面临三大挑战：简历布局和内容的极端异构性、大语言模型的高成本和延迟、缺乏标准化数据集和评估工具。

Method: 结合微调的布局解析器标准化文档格式、基于并行提示和指令调优的推理高效LLM提取器、以及由新基准数据集支持的鲁棒两阶段自动评估框架。

Result: 广泛实验表明该框架在准确性和效率上显著优于强基线，特别是微调的0.6B紧凑LLM在实现顶级准确性的同时显著降低推理延迟和计算成本。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了简历信息提取的关键挑战，已在阿里巴巴智能HR平台全面部署，支持其业务部门的实时应用。

Abstract: Automated resume information extraction is critical for scaling talent
acquisition, yet its real-world deployment faces three major challenges: the
extreme heterogeneity of resume layouts and content, the high cost and latency
of large language models (LLMs), and the lack of standardized datasets and
evaluation tools. In this work, we present a layout-aware and
efficiency-optimized framework for automated extraction and evaluation that
addresses all three challenges. Our system combines a fine-tuned layout parser
to normalize diverse document formats, an inference-efficient LLM extractor
based on parallel prompting and instruction tuning, and a robust two-stage
automated evaluation framework supported by new benchmark datasets. Extensive
experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines
in both accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we demonstrate that a
fine-tuned compact 0.6B LLM achieves top-tier accuracy while significantly
reducing inference latency and computational cost. The system is fully deployed
in Alibaba's intelligent HR platform, supporting real-time applications across
its business units.

TL;DR: EVisRAG是一个端到端的视觉检索增强生成框架，通过证据引导的多图像推理来减少幻觉并提高答案准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VRAG系统在多图像感知和证据整合方面存在不足，导致推理基础薄弱和错误结论。

Method: 提出EVisRAG框架，首先观察检索到的图像并记录每张图像的证据，然后从聚合证据中得出最终答案。使用RS-GRPO训练方法，将细粒度奖励与范围特定标记绑定，联合优化视觉感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个视觉问答基准测试中，EVisRAG相比基础VLM平均提升27%的性能，能够精确感知和定位问题相关证据。

Conclusion: EVisRAG通过证据引导的多图像推理显著提升了视觉检索增强生成的性能，类似于真实侦探的推理过程。

Abstract: Visual retrieval-augmented generation (VRAG) augments vision-language models
(VLMs) with external visual knowledge to ground reasoning and reduce
hallucinations. Yet current VRAG systems often fail to reliably perceive and
integrate evidence across multiple images, leading to weak grounding and
erroneous conclusions. In this paper, we propose EVisRAG, an end-to-end
framework that learns to reason with evidence-guided multi-image to address
this issue. The model first observes retrieved images and records per-image
evidence, then derives the final answer from the aggregated evidence. To train
EVisRAG effectively, we introduce Reward-Scoped Group Relative Policy
Optimization (RS-GRPO), which binds fine-grained rewards to scope-specific
tokens to jointly optimize visual perception and reasoning abilities of VLMs.
Experimental results on multiple visual question answering benchmarks
demonstrate that EVisRAG delivers substantial end-to-end gains over backbone
VLM with 27\% improvements on average. Further analysis shows that, powered by
RS-GRPO, EVisRAG improves answer accuracy by precisely perceiving and
localizing question-relevant evidence across multiple images and deriving the
final answer from that evidence, much like a real detective.

*Steve Han,Gilberto Titericz Junior,Tom Balough,Wenfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Judge's Verdict Benchmark，一种评估LLM作为响应准确性评判员的两步方法，测试了54个LLM在复制人类判断方面的表现，发现27个模型达到Tier 1性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型作为评判员的能力，特别是在RAG或Agentic流程中评估响应准确性的任务，需要超越传统相关性分析的更全面方法。

Method: 两步方法：首先进行相关性测试筛选表现良好的评判员，然后使用z分数进行人类相似性测试，识别人类样判断（|z| < 1）和超一致判断（z > 1）两种模式。

Result: 54个测试LLM中有27个达到Tier 1性能：23个模型展示人类样判断模式，4个模型展示超一致行为。评判员优秀程度不仅取决于模型大小，还取决于特定训练策略。

Conclusion: 仅相关性不足以评估评判员，需要基于一致性模式的"评判员图灵测试"，并提供了标准化基准来将LLM评判员分类到不同性能层级。

Abstract: This research introduces the Judge's Verdict Benchmark, a novel two-step
methodology to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) as judges for response
accuracy evaluation tasks. We assess how well 54 LLMs can replicate human
judgment when scoring responses from RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) or
Agentic pipelines against ground truth answers. Our methodology progresses from
traditional correlation analysis to comprehensive Cohen's Kappa analysis that
measures actual agreement patterns. The two-step approach includes: (1) a
correlation test that filters judges with strong alignment, followed by (2) a
human-likeness test using z-scores to identify two distinct judgment patterns:
human-like judgment (|z| < 1) that mimics natural human variation, and
super-consistent judgment (z > 1) that exceeds typical human-to-human agreement
levels. This methodology reveals that 27 out of 54 tested LLMs achieve Tier 1
performance: 23 models exhibit human-like patterns that preserve the nuances of
human judgment, while 4 models demonstrate super-consistent behavior, a pattern
that could indicate either enhanced reliability or oversimplification of
complex judgments. Testing 43 open-source models (1B-405B parameters) and 11
closed models (GPT, Gemini, Claude variants), we demonstrate that judge
excellence is not solely dependent on model size but on specific training
strategies. Our key contributions include: (1) establishing that correlation
alone is insufficient for judge evaluation, (2) introducing a "Turing Test for
judges" based on agreement patterns, and (3) providing a standardized benchmark
for classifying LLM judges into distinct performance tiers for different
evaluation needs.

*Adam Byerly,Daniel Khashabi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Gold Panning Bandits框架，利用LLM的位置偏见作为诊断信号，通过重新排序文档来高效识别相关内容，相比随机排列基线减少65%的LLM查询次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多文档环境中存在强烈的位置偏见，系统性地基于位置而非相关性来优先处理信息。现有方法将此偏见视为需要减轻的噪声，而本文则将其转化为可利用的诊断信号。

Method: 将选择重新排序的问题构建为二分图匹配问题。提出贪心O(N log N)策略，通过将最不确定的文档放置在信息量最大的位置来实现可比性能，避免使用O(N^3)的匈牙利算法。

Result: 在知识密集型NLP任务上，该方法使用比随机排列基线少65%的语言模型查询就能识别相关文档，显著降低计算成本且无需模型重新训练。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明固有的LLM偏见可以从负担转化为资产，实现高效的推理时优化。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit a strong position bias in multi-document
contexts, systematically prioritizing information based on location rather than
relevance. While existing approaches treat this bias as noise to be mitigated,
we introduce Gold Panning Bandits, a framework that leverages position bias as
a diagnostic signal: by reordering documents and observing shifts in the
model's responses, we can efficiently identify the most relevant content. We
frame the problem of choosing reorderings as a bipartite matching problem.
While an optimal assignment can be computed at each iteration with the
Hungarian algorithm in $O(N^3)$ time, we propose a greedy $O(N \log N)$
strategy that achieves comparable performance by prioritizing the placement of
the most uncertain documents in the most informative positions. Our approach
identifies relevant documents using up to 65\% fewer language model queries
than random permutation baselines on knowledge-intensive NLP tasks,
substantially reducing computational cost without model retraining. This work
demonstrates that inherent LLM biases can be transformed from liabilities into
assets for efficient, inference-time optimization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个用于孟加拉语仇恨言论分类的少样本框架，结合卡方统计分析和自适应多数投票机制，在BLP-2025任务1A中取得了67.61的微F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督方法需要大量标注数据，这对于低资源语言来说成本高昂。

Method: 使用卡方统计分析进行关键词提取，结合自适应多数投票进行决策制定。比较统计关键词选择与随机方法，以及基于共识质量扩展分类的自适应投票机制。

Result: PromptGuard达到67.61的微F1分数，优于n-gram基线(60.75)和随机方法(14.65)。卡方关键词在所有类别中都显示出最一致的影响。

Conclusion: 卡方关键词提供了跨类别的一致改进，而自适应投票对需要扩展分类轮次的模糊案例有益。

Abstract: The BLP-2025 Task 1A requires Bengali hate speech classification into six
categories. Traditional supervised approaches need extensive labeled datasets
that are expensive for low-resource languages. We developed PromptGuard, a
few-shot framework combining chi-square statistical analysis for keyword
extraction with adaptive majority voting for decision-making. We explore
statistical keyword selection versus random approaches and adaptive voting
mechanisms that extend classification based on consensus quality. Chi-square
keywords provide consistent improvements across categories, while adaptive
voting benefits ambiguous cases requiring extended classification rounds.
PromptGuard achieves a micro-F1 of 67.61, outperforming n-gram baselines
(60.75) and random approaches (14.65). Ablation studies confirm
chi-square-based keywords show the most consistent impact across all
categories.

TL;DR: RISE方法通过旋转操作在嵌入空间中表示语义转换，证明了跨语言和跨模型的一致性几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解语言和嵌入模型如何编码语义关系对于模型可解释性和控制至关重要，但现代高维文本表示缺乏直观的几何特性。

Method: 引入Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE)方法，将语义转换表示为嵌入空间中的一致旋转操作，利用现代语言表示的流形结构。

Result: 在3个嵌入模型、3个数据集和7种形态多样的语言上评估，RISE能一致地映射具有不同语法特征的语篇级语义转换。

Conclusion: 首次系统证明语篇级语义转换对应于多语言嵌入空间中的一致几何操作，为句子级别的线性表示假设提供了实证支持。

Abstract: Understanding how language and embedding models encode semantic relationships
is fundamental to model interpretability and control. While early word
embeddings exhibited intuitive vector arithmetic (''king'' - ''man'' +
''woman'' = ''queen''), modern high-dimensional text representations lack
straightforward interpretable geometric properties. We introduce
Rotor-Invariant Shift Estimation (RISE), a geometric approach that represents
semantic transformations as consistent rotational operations in embedding
space, leveraging the manifold structure of modern language representations.
RISE operations have the ability to operate across both languages and models
with high transfer of performance, suggesting the existence of analogous
cross-lingual geometric structure. We evaluate RISE across three embedding
models, three datasets, and seven morphologically diverse languages in five
major language groups. Our results demonstrate that RISE consistently maps
discourse-level semantic transformations with distinct grammatical features
(e.g., negation and conditionality) across languages and models. This work
provides the first systematic demonstration that discourse-level semantic
transformations correspond to consistent geometric operations in multilingual
embedding spaces, empirically supporting the Linear Representation Hypothesis
at the sentence level.

efficiency through experiments. Compared to other attack methods, our approach
is particularly effective for large models without high demand for
computational resources.

TL;DR: NG-Router是一个基于知识图谱的多智能体协作框架，通过图神经网络学习任务感知的路由分布，解决营养问答中的推理能力不足和上下文过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有营养问答方法面临单智能体系统推理能力有限、多智能体架构设计复杂以及上下文过载阻碍准确决策等挑战。

Method: 将营养问答构建为监督式知识图谱引导的多智能体协作问题，集成智能体节点到异构知识图谱中，使用图神经网络学习路由分布，并提出基于梯度的子图检索机制识别关键证据。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型上的广泛实验表明，NG-Router始终优于单智能体和集成基线方法。

Conclusion: NG-Router为复杂营养健康任务提供了一种原则性的领域感知多智能体推理方法。

Abstract: Diet plays a central role in human health, and Nutrition Question Answering
(QA) offers a promising path toward personalized dietary guidance and the
prevention of diet-related chronic diseases. However, existing methods face two
fundamental challenges: the limited reasoning capacity of single-agent systems
and the complexity of designing effective multi-agent architectures, as well as
contextual overload that hinders accurate decision-making. We introduce
Nutritional-Graph Router (NG-Router), a novel framework that formulates
nutritional QA as a supervised, knowledge-graph-guided multi-agent
collaboration problem. NG-Router integrates agent nodes into heterogeneous
knowledge graphs and employs a graph neural network to learn task-aware routing
distributions over agents, leveraging soft supervision derived from empirical
agent performance. To further address contextual overload, we propose a
gradient-based subgraph retrieval mechanism that identifies salient evidence
during training, thereby enhancing multi-hop and relational reasoning.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and backbone models
demonstrate that NG-Router consistently outperforms both single-agent and
ensemble baselines, offering a principled approach to domain-aware multi-agent
reasoning for complex nutritional health tasks.

TL;DR: NarraBench是一个基于理论构建的叙事理解任务分类法，调查了78个现有基准，发现当前评估在叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等方面存在严重不足，只有27%的叙事任务被现有基准充分覆盖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前叙事理解任务的评估存在显著不足，许多关键方面被忽视或与现有指标不匹配，需要新的评估方法来覆盖被忽视的叙事理解方面。

Method: 提出了NarraBench分类法，对78个现有叙事理解基准进行了系统调查和分析，识别评估覆盖的差距。

Result: 发现只有27%的叙事任务被现有基准充分覆盖，叙事事件、风格、视角和启示等关键方面在现有评估中几乎缺失。

Conclusion: 需要开发更多能够评估构成性主观和视角化叙事方面的基准，该分类法、调查和方法论对测试LLM叙事理解能力具有重要价值。

Abstract: We present NarraBench, a theory-informed taxonomy of narrative-understanding
tasks, as well as an associated survey of 78 existing benchmarks in the area.
We find significant need for new evaluations covering aspects of narrative
understanding that are either overlooked in current work or are poorly aligned
with existing metrics. Specifically, we estimate that only 27% of narrative
tasks are well captured by existing benchmarks, and we note that some areas --
including narrative events, style, perspective, and revelation -- are nearly
absent from current evaluations. We also note the need for increased
development of benchmarks capable of assessing constitutively subjective and
perspectival aspects of narrative, that is, aspects for which there is
generally no single correct answer. Our taxonomy, survey, and methodology are
of value to NLP researchers seeking to test LLM narrative understanding.

TL;DR: CoBia是一个轻量级对抗攻击套件，通过构造对话让LLMs表达关于社会群体的偏见主张，然后评估模型是否能从这些偏见中恢复并拒绝后续偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs通过了标准安全检查，但在对话中仍可能表现出有害行为，如表达种族主义观点。需要系统分析LLMs在何种条件下偏离规范或道德行为。

Method: 创建构造对话让模型表达偏见主张，然后评估模型是否能恢复并拒绝后续偏见问题。评估11个开源和专有LLMs在6个社会人口类别上的表现。

Result: 有目的构造的对话能可靠地揭示偏见放大，LLMs在对话中经常无法拒绝后续偏见问题。这种压力测试突显了通过互动可以显现的深层嵌入偏见。

Conclusion: CoBia方法能有效揭示LLMs中深层的偏见问题，表明需要更严格的测试来确保模型的安全性和公平性。

Abstract: Improvements in model construction, including fortified safety guardrails,
allow Large language models (LLMs) to increasingly pass standard safety checks.
However, LLMs sometimes slip into revealing harmful behavior, such as
expressing racist viewpoints, during conversations. To analyze this
systematically, we introduce CoBia, a suite of lightweight adversarial attacks
that allow us to refine the scope of conditions under which LLMs depart from
normative or ethical behavior in conversations. CoBia creates a constructed
conversation where the model utters a biased claim about a social group. We
then evaluate whether the model can recover from the fabricated bias claim and
reject biased follow-up questions. We evaluate 11 open-source as well as
proprietary LLMs for their outputs related to six socio-demographic categories
that are relevant to individual safety and fair treatment, i.e., gender, race,
religion, nationality, sex orientation, and others. Our evaluation is based on
established LLM-based bias metrics, and we compare the results against human
judgments to scope out the LLMs' reliability and alignment. The results suggest
that purposefully constructed conversations reliably reveal bias amplification
and that LLMs often fail to reject biased follow-up questions during dialogue.
This form of stress-testing highlights deeply embedded biases that can be
surfaced through interaction. Code and artifacts are available at

TL;DR: iBERT是一种可解释的BERT编码器，通过稀疏非负混合的上下文无关感知向量来表示输入标记，实现可解释和可控的嵌入表示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了模块化并暴露语言中的判别线索（如风格和语义结构），创建可解释和可控的嵌入表示

Method: 使用稀疏非负混合的上下文无关感知向量表示每个输入标记，可池化为句子嵌入或直接在标记级别使用

Result: 在STEL基准测试中，风格表示效果比SBERT基线提高约8个百分点，在作者验证任务中保持竞争力，并能将特定风格属性（如表情符号使用、正式性、拼写错误）分配给特定感知向量

Conclusion: iBERT不仅限于风格建模，其结构模块化设计能够可解释地分解数据中的任何判别信号，即使在监督混合风格和语义因素时也能实现泛化

Abstract: We present iBERT (interpretable-BERT), an encoder to produce inherently
interpretable and controllable embeddings - designed to modularize and expose
the discriminative cues present in language, such as stylistic and semantic
structure. Each input token is represented as a sparse, non-negative mixture
over k context-independent sense vectors, which can be pooled into sentence
embeddings or used directly at the token level. This enables modular control
over representation, before any decoding or downstream use.
  To demonstrate our model's interpretability, we evaluate it on a suite of
style-focused tasks. On the STEL benchmark, it improves style representation
effectiveness by ~8 points over SBERT-style baselines, while maintaining
competitive performance on authorship verification. Because each embedding is a
structured composition of interpretable senses, we highlight how specific style
attributes - such as emoji use, formality, or misspelling can be assigned to
specific sense vectors. While our experiments center on style, iBERT is not
limited to stylistic modeling. Its structural modularity is designed to
interpretably decompose whichever discriminative signals are present in the
data - enabling generalization even when supervision blends stylistic and
semantic factors.

*Hossein Entezari Zarch,Lei Gao,Chaoyi Jiang,Murali Annavarm*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DELTA是一种无需训练的高效注意力机制，通过将Transformer层分组为全注意力层、选择层和稀疏注意力层，在保持推理准确性的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在解码过程中需要对整个序列进行注意力计算，计算成本高昂。现有的稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了计算，但在推理任务中会导致严重的精度下降。

Method: 将Transformer层分为三组：初始全注意力层、选择层（通过聚合注意力得分识别重要token）和稀疏注意力层（仅关注选定子集）。

Result: 在AIME和GPQA-Diamond等推理基准测试中，DELTA在保持与全注意力相同或更高精度的同时，将注意力token数量减少5倍，端到端速度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: 选择性重用中间注意力图是实现高效长上下文推理的稳健路径。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of
intermediate attention maps offers a robust path toward efficient long-context
reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Despite autoregressive large language models (arLLMs) being the current
dominant paradigm in language modeling, they resist knowledge injection via
fine-tuning due to inherent shortcomings such as the "reversal curse" -- the
challenge of answering questions that reverse the original information order in
the training sample. Masked diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are rapidly
emerging as a powerful alternative to the arLLM paradigm, with evidence of
better data efficiency and free of the "reversal curse" in pre-training.
However, it is unknown whether these advantages extend to the post-training
phase, i.e. whether pre-trained dLLMs can easily acquire new knowledge through
fine-tuning. On three diverse datasets, we fine-tune arLLMs and dLLMs,
evaluating them with forward and backward style Question Answering (QA) to
probe knowledge generalization and the reversal curse. Our results confirm that
arLLMs critically rely on extensive data augmentation via paraphrases for QA
generalization, and paraphrases are only effective when their information order
matches the QA style. Conversely, dLLMs achieve high accuracies on both forward
and backward QAs without paraphrases; adding paraphrases yields only marginal
gains. Lastly, inspired by the dLLM's performance, we introduce a novel masked
fine-tuning paradigm for knowledge injection into pre-trained arLLMs. This
proposed method successfully and drastically improves the data efficiency of
arLLM fine-tuning, effectively closing the performance gap with dLLMs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为溯因偏好学习的新微调范式，通过逆转传统条件学习来改进大型语言模型对反事实提示的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前沿大语言模型（如GPT-5和Claude Sonnet）即使经过RLHF和DPO对齐后仍然存在过度自信问题，无法区分需要不同回答的反事实提示。

Method: 提出溯因偏好学习，通过基于回答学习对提示的偏好来构建溯因数据集，实现溯因DPO及其变体DPOP，并采用多任务目标统一响应选择和提示判别。

Result: 在溯因数据集上，多任务DPOP将响应选择准确率从90.0%提升至99.5%，提示判别准确率从54.7%提升至85.0%。在AlpacaEval上，胜率从5.26%提升至6.17%。

Conclusion: 溯因偏好学习在保持传统偏好优化优势的同时，解决了反事实提示这一被忽视的挑战，提高了模型对提示差异的敏感性。

Abstract: Frontier large language models such as GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet remain prone
to overconfidence even after alignment through Reinforcement Learning with
Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). For instance,
they tend to offer the same conservative answer "No" to both questions "Can I
eat the [food / potato chips] that has been left out overnight?" despite the
latter requiring no refridgeration for safe consumption. We find that this
failure is potentially attributed to a limitation of existing preference
learning: it emphasizes selecting the correct response for a given prompt,
while neglecting counterfactual prompts that should alter the response.
  To address this limitation, we propose abductive preference learning, a
fine-tuning paradigm that reverses the conventional conditioning by learning
preferences over prompts given a response. To validate this idea, we construct
an abductive dataset derived from the HaluEval QA benchmark with 1,001 entries,
implementing abductive DPO and its variant DPOP. Experiments reveal
complementary strengths: standard methods improve response selection, abductive
methods improve prompt discrimination, while a multitask objective unifies
both. On the abductive dataset, multitask DPOP boosts accuracy from $90.0\%$ to
$99.5\%$ in response selection and $54.7\%$ to $85.0\%$ in prompt
discrimination, with qualitative evidence highlighting improved sensitivity to
prompt differences. Finally, evaluation on AlpacaEval shows multitask DPOP
improves win rate (from $5.26\%$ to $6.17\%$), confirming that abductive
preference learning preserves the benefits of conventional preference
optimization while addressing the overlooked challenge of counterfactual
prompts.

Conclusion: HIPPD通过模拟人脑的层次信息处理机制，有效解决了性格检测中的上下文捕捉和特征提取问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: Personality detection from text aims to infer an individual's personality
traits based on linguistic patterns. However, existing machine learning
approaches often struggle to capture contextual information spanning multiple
posts and tend to fall short in extracting representative and robust features
in semantically sparse environments. This paper presents HIPPD, a
brain-inspired framework for personality detection that emulates the
hierarchical information processing of the human brain. HIPPD utilises a large
language model to simulate the cerebral cortex, enabling global semantic
reasoning and deep feature abstraction. A dynamic memory module, modelled after
the prefrontal cortex, performs adaptive gating and selective retention of
critical features, with all adjustments driven by dopaminergic prediction error
feedback. Subsequently, a set of specialised lightweight models, emulating the
basal ganglia, are dynamically routed via a strict winner-takes-all mechanism
to capture the personality-related patterns they are most proficient at
recognising. Extensive experiments on the Kaggle and Pandora datasets
demonstrate that HIPPD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Alignment training has tradeoffs: it helps language models (LMs) gain in
reasoning and instruction following but might lose out on skills such as
creativity and calibration, where unaligned base models are better at. We aim
to make the best of both worlds through model collaboration, where different
models in the training pipeline collaborate and complement each other. Since LM
responses feature interleaving skills that favor different models, we propose
Switch Generation, where pretrained and aligned model versions take turns to
``speak'' in a response sequence. Specifically, we train a switcher LM by
learning from outcomes of choosing different models to generate the next
segment across diverse queries and contexts. At inference time, the switcher LM
guides different model checkpoints to dynamically generate the next segment
where their strengths are most needed. Extensive experiments with 8 model
collaboration baselines and 18 datasets show that 1) model collaboration
consistently outperforms individual models on 16 out of 18 tasks, and 2) Switch
Generation further outperforms baselines by 12.9% on average. Further analysis
reveals that Switch Generation discovers compositional skills to solve problems
where individual models struggle and generalizes to unseen models and tasks,
reusing and repurposing by-products in expensive model training pipelines that
are otherwise discarded.

Result: 实验结果显示所有三种方法都能有效利用跨度级标注提高忠实性，其中unlikelihood训练效果最好。

Conclusion: 基于跨度级标注的微调策略能显著提升LLM生成摘要的忠实性，为减少幻觉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization using large language models (LLMs) has become an
essential tool for condensing information. However, despite their ability to
generate fluent summaries, these models sometimes produce unfaithful summaries,
introducing hallucinations at the word, phrase, or concept level. Existing
mitigation strategies, such as post-processing corrections or contrastive
learning with synthetically generated negative samples, fail to fully address
the diverse errors that can occur in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we
investigate fine-tuning strategies to reduce the occurrence of unfaithful spans
in generated summaries. First, we automatically generate summaries for the set
of source documents in the training set with a variety of LLMs and then use
GPT-4o to annotate any hallucinations it detects at the span-level. Leveraging
these annotations, we fine-tune LLMs with both hallucination-free summaries and
annotated unfaithful spans to enhance model faithfulness. In this paper, we
introduce a new dataset that contains both faithful and unfaithful summaries
with span-level labels and we evaluate three techniques to fine-tuning a LLM to
improve the faithfulness of the resulting summarization: gradient ascent,
unlikelihood training, and task vector negation. Experimental results show that
all three approaches successfully leverage span-level annotations to improve
faithfulness, with unlikelihood training being the most effective.

Motivation: 现有仇恨表情包检测方法主要依赖预训练语言模型，但较少关注仇恨表情包的本质特征。基于哲学和心理学见解，仇恨表情包具有预设上下文和表达虚假声明的两个基本特征。

Method: 开发PCM模块建模多模态上下文信息，引入FACT模块整合外部知识并利用跨模态参考图检测虚假声明，结合两者构建SHIELD框架。

Result: SHIELD在多个数据集和指标上优于最先进方法，并在假新闻检测等其他任务上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过建模仇恨表情包的两个基本特征（预设上下文和虚假声明），SHIELD框架能够有效检测仇恨内容，并在多个任务中表现出色。

Abstract: While memes are often humorous, they are frequently used to disseminate hate,
causing serious harm to individuals and society. Current approaches to hateful
meme detection mainly rely on pre-trained language models. However, less focus
has been dedicated to \textit{what make a meme hateful}. Drawing on insights
from philosophy and psychology, we argue that hateful memes are characterized
by two essential features: a \textbf{presupposed context} and the expression of
\textbf{false claims}. To capture presupposed context, we develop \textbf{PCM}
for modeling contextual information across modalities. To detect false claims,
we introduce the \textbf{FACT} module, which integrates external knowledge and
harnesses cross-modal reference graphs. By combining PCM and FACT, we introduce
\textbf{\textsf{SHIELD}}, a hateful meme detection framework designed to
capture the fundamental nature of hate. Extensive experiments show that SHIELD
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across datasets and metrics, while
demonstrating versatility on other tasks, such as fake news detection.

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM中分词器的公平性问题，提出了新的评估指标STRR来补充传统的fertility指标，揭示了不同语言在分词中的系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分词评估指标fertility只关注压缩效率，无法反映词汇表在不同语言和领域间的分配公平性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 分析了6个广泛使用的分词器在7种语言和2个领域中的表现，提出了单token保留率(STRR)作为新的评估指标。

Result: 发现英语分词稳定性高，中文分词token数量多，印地语分词碎片化严重。STRR揭示了英语被系统性优先，中文得到强支持，印地语被分割的问题。

Conclusion: STRR指标能够补充fertility，为设计更公平的多语言分词器提供实用指导，有助于改善跨语言公平性。

Abstract: Tokenization is a crucial but under-evaluated step in large language models
(LLMs). The standard metric, fertility (the average number of tokens per word),
captures compression efficiency but obscures how vocabularies are allocated
across languages and domains. We analyze six widely used tokenizers across
seven languages and two domains, finding stable fertility for English, high
fertility for Chinese, and little domain sensitivity. To address fertility's
blind spots, we propose the Single Token Retention Rate (STRR), which measures
the proportion of words preserved as single tokens. STRR reveals systematic
prioritization of English, strong support for Chinese, and fragmentation in
Hindi, offering an interpretable view of cross-lingual fairness. Our results
show that STRR complements fertility and provides practical guidance for
designing more equitable multilingual tokenizers.

Abstract: Deliberative tree search is a cornerstone of modern Large Language Model
(LLM) research, driving the pivot from brute-force scaling toward algorithmic
efficiency. This single paradigm unifies two critical frontiers:
\textbf{Test-Time Scaling (TTS)}, which deploys on-demand computation to solve
hard problems, and \textbf{Self-Improvement}, which uses search-generated data
to durably enhance model parameters. However, this burgeoning field is
fragmented and lacks a common formalism, particularly concerning the ambiguous
role of the reward signal -- is it a transient heuristic or a durable learning
target? This paper resolves this ambiguity by introducing a unified framework
that deconstructs search algorithms into three core components: the
\emph{Search Mechanism}, \emph{Reward Formulation}, and \emph{Transition
Function}. We establish a formal distinction between transient \textbf{Search
Guidance} for TTS and durable \textbf{Parametric Reward Modeling} for
Self-Improvement. Building on this formalism, we introduce a component-centric
taxonomy, synthesize the state-of-the-art, and chart a research roadmap toward
more systematic progress in creating autonomous, self-improving agents.

Abstract: As Machine Translation (MT) becomes increasingly commonplace, understanding
how the general public perceives and relies on imperfect MT is crucial for
contextualizing MT research in real-world applications. We present a human
study conducted in a public museum (n=452), investigating how fluency and
adequacy errors impact bilingual and non-bilingual users' reliance on MT during
casual use. Our findings reveal that non-bilingual users often over-rely on MT
due to a lack of evaluation strategies and alternatives, while experiencing the
impact of errors can prompt users to reassess future reliance. This highlights
the need for MT evaluation and NLP explanation techniques to promote not only
MT quality, but also MT literacy among its users.

Motivation: 当前语音到语音翻译方法使用语音令牌作为中间表示，但单个令牌语义密度不足，需要多个令牌才能表达完整语义单元。

Method: 引入多令牌预测损失到S2UT模型中，在CTC损失计算的隐藏表示层应用MTP损失，使模型在每个位置预测多个后续令牌。

Conclusion: 在中间层应用MTP损失可以更早且更有效地增强隐藏表示，显著提升语音到单元翻译的性能。

Abstract: Current direct speech-to-speech translation methods predominantly employ
speech tokens as intermediate representations. However, a single speech token
is not dense in semantics, so we generally need multiple tokens to express a
complete semantic unit. To address this limitation, we introduce multi-token
prediction (MTP) loss into speech-to-unit translation (S2UT) models, enabling
models to predict multiple subsequent tokens at each position, thereby
capturing more complete semantics and enhancing information density per
position. Initial MTP implementations apply the loss at the final layer, which
improves output representation but initiates information enrichment too late.
We hypothesize that advancing the information enrichment process to
intermediate layers can achieve earlier and more effective enhancement of
hidden representation. Consequently, we propose MTP-S2UT loss, applying MTP
loss to hidden representation where CTC loss is computed. Experiments
demonstrate that all MTP loss variants consistently improve the quality of S2UT
translation, with MTP-S2UT achieving the best performance.

*Shu Zhao,Tan Yu,Anbang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ExpandSearch方法，通过强化学习训练LLM搜索代理进行查询扩展，结合预训练的压缩模型处理检索文档，在有限数据和计算资源下显著提升多跳问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理增强搜索代理在复杂查询和多跳问答任务中表现不佳，主要受限于推理能力和搜索能力不足。

Method: 训练基于LLM的搜索代理进行查询扩展，每个回合生成多个查询变体并行搜索；引入预训练压缩模型帮助理解检索文档，让搜索代理专注于查询生成。

Result: 在七个问答基准测试中，ExpandSearch相比最先进基线平均提升4.4%，在多跳推理任务上表现尤其突出。

Conclusion: 即使使用小规模3B LLM，结合压缩模型辅助也能实现强大的查询扩展能力，在多跳问答基准上达到最先进准确率。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented search agents, such as Search-R1, are trained to reason,
search, and generate the final answer iteratively. Nevertheless, due to their
limited capabilities in reasoning and search, their performance on multi-hop QA
benchmarks remains far from satisfactory. To handle complex or compound
queries, we train an LLM-based search agent with the native capability of query
expansion through reinforcement learning. In each turn, our search agent
proposes several query variants, which are searched simultaneously to cover
more relevant information. Meanwhile, given limited post-training data and
computing resources, it is very challenging for a search agent to master
multiple tasks, including query generation, retrieved information
understanding, and answer generation. Therefore, we propose incorporating a
pre-trained squeezer model that helps the search agent understand the retrieved
documents, allowing the search agent to focus on query generation for high
retrieval recall. With the assistance of the squeezer model, we discover that
even a small-scale 3B LLM can demonstrate a strong capability of query
expansion and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the multi-hop QA benchmarks.
To be specific, our experiments across seven question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that our method, named ExpandSearch, achieves an average
improvement of 4.4% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with strong gains
on multi-hop reasoning tasks requiring diverse evidence aggregation.

*Yuyi Huang,Runzhe Zhan,Lidia S. Chao,Ailin Tao,Derek F. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文识别了大型语言模型在长思维链推理中的路径漂移漏洞，即推理轨迹会偏离安全对齐路径，导致违反安全约束的内容。提出了路径漂移诱导框架和防御策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现尽管LLMs通过RLHF等技术进行了对齐，但在长思维链推理中仍存在未被充分探索的漏洞——推理轨迹会从对齐路径漂移，产生违反安全约束的内容。

Method: 通过实证分析识别了三种路径漂移行为触发因素，构建了三阶段路径漂移诱导框架（认知负荷放大、自我角色启动、条件链劫持），并提出了包含角色归因修正和元认知反思的路径级防御策略。

Result: 路径漂移诱导框架的三个阶段都能独立降低拒绝率，组合使用时效果进一步增强。防御策略能有效缓解路径漂移风险。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在长形式推理中需要超越词元级对齐，进行轨迹级对齐监督的重要性，揭示了长思维链模型中的安全漏洞和防御需求。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for complex
reasoning tasks, Long Chain-of-Thought (Long-CoT) prompting has emerged as a
key paradigm for structured inference. Despite early-stage safeguards enabled
by alignment techniques such as RLHF, we identify a previously underexplored
vulnerability: reasoning trajectories in Long-CoT models can drift from aligned
paths, resulting in content that violates safety constraints. We term this
phenomenon Path Drift. Through empirical analysis, we uncover three behavioral
triggers of Path Drift: (1) first-person commitments that induce goal-driven
reasoning that delays refusal signals; (2) ethical evaporation, where
surface-level disclaimers bypass alignment checkpoints; (3) condition chain
escalation, where layered cues progressively steer models toward unsafe
completions. Building on these insights, we introduce a three-stage Path Drift
Induction Framework comprising cognitive load amplification, self-role priming,
and condition chain hijacking. Each stage independently reduces refusal rates,
while their combination further compounds the effect. To mitigate these risks,
we propose a path-level defense strategy incorporating role attribution
correction and metacognitive reflection (reflective safety cues). Our findings
highlight the need for trajectory-level alignment oversight in long-form
reasoning beyond token-level alignment.

*Jiaqi Liu,Lanruo Wang,Su Liu,Xin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在医疗文本分类任务中，轻量级模型DistilBERT与标准BERT的性能对比，发现在参数更少的情况下，DistilBERT配合交叉熵损失函数能达到最佳平衡效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗环境中部署面临成本、延迟和隐私限制，需要探索轻量级模型在医疗文本分类中的潜力。

Method: 使用公开医疗摘要语料库，在固定分词器、序列长度、优化器和训练计划的情况下，对BERT base和DistilBERT进行微调，比较三种损失函数：标准交叉熵、类别加权交叉熵和焦点损失。

Result: DistilBERT配合标准交叉熵损失在测试集上表现最佳，同时使用的参数远少于BERT base。报告了准确率、宏F1和加权F1指标。

Conclusion: 建议的实用默认方案：从紧凑编码器和交叉熵开始，然后添加校准和任务特定检查，最后再考虑使用更重的模型。

Abstract: Large language models work well for many NLP tasks, but they are hard to
deploy in health settings with strict cost, latency, and privacy limits. We
revisit a lightweight recipe for medical abstract classification and ask how
far compact encoders can go under a controlled budget. Using the public medical
abstracts corpus, we finetune BERT base and DistilBERT with three objectives
standard cross-entropy, class weighted cross entropy, and focal loss keeping
tokenizer, sequence length, optimizer, and schedule fixed. DistilBERT with
plain cross-entropy gives the best balance on the test set while using far
fewer parameters than BERT base. We report accuracy, Macro F1, and Weighted F1,
release the evaluation code, and include confusion analyses to make error
patterns clear. Our results suggest a practical default: start with a compact
encoder and cross-entropy, then add calibration and task-specific checks before
moving to heavier models.

*Adnan El Assadi,Isaac Chung,Roman Solomatin,Niklas Muennighoff,Kenneth Enevoldsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HUME框架，首次系统性地测量人类在文本嵌入任务上的表现，为模型性能评估提供人类基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型评估框架缺乏可靠的人类性能基准，限制了模型分数的可解释性，难以理解模型在哪些方面成功或失败。

Method: 开发HUME人类评估框架，在16个MTEB数据集上测量人类表现，涵盖重排序、分类、聚类和语义文本相似度任务，涉及高资源和低资源语言。

Result: 人类平均表现77.6%，最佳嵌入模型80.1%，但存在显著差异：模型在某些数据集接近天花板性能，在其他数据集表现不佳，尤其在低资源语言上。

Conclusion: 提供了人类性能基准、任务难度模式洞察，以及可扩展的评估框架，使模型评估更有意义，并指导模型和基准的发展。

Abstract: Comparing human and model performance offers a valuable perspective for
understanding the strengths and limitations of embedding models, highlighting
where they succeed and where they fail to capture meaning and nuance. However,
such comparisons are rarely made, as human performance on embedding tasks is
difficult to measure. To fill this gap, we introduce HUME: Human Evaluation
Framework for Text Embeddings. While frameworks like MTEB provide broad model
evaluation, they lack reliable estimates of human performance, limiting the
interpretability of model scores. We measure human performance across 16 MTEB
datasets spanning reranking, classification, clustering, and semantic textual
similarity across linguistically diverse high- and low-resource languages.
Humans achieve an average performance of 77.6% compared to 80.1% for the best
embedding model, although variation is substantial: models reach near-ceiling
performance on some datasets while struggling on others, suggesting dataset
issues and revealing shortcomings in low-resource languages. We provide human
performance baselines, insight into task difficulty patterns, and an extensible
evaluation framework that enables a more meaningful interpretation of the model
and informs the development of both models and benchmarks. Our code, dataset,
and leaderboard are publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLMN是一个神经符号框架，通过连续可读的概念嵌入和模糊逻辑推理，在保持性能的同时提升NLP系统的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在NLP中可解释性不足的问题，特别是在医疗和金融领域，现有概念瓶颈模型要么损害文本表示，要么削弱语义，且很少建模动态概念交互。

Method: 将概念表示为连续的人类可读嵌入，应用模糊逻辑推理学习自适应交互规则，增强原始文本特征与概念感知表示，自动推导可解释逻辑规则。

Result: 在多个数据集和预训练语言模型上，CLMN比现有基于概念的方法获得更高准确率，同时提升解释质量。

Conclusion: 在统一概念空间中整合神经表示与符号推理可以产生实用、透明的NLP系统。

Abstract: Deep learning has advanced NLP, but interpretability remains limited,
especially in healthcare and finance. Concept bottleneck models tie predictions
to human concepts in vision, but NLP versions either use binary activations
that harm text representations or latent concepts that weaken semantics, and
they rarely model dynamic concept interactions such as negation and context. We
introduce the Concept Language Model Network (CLMN), a neural-symbolic
framework that keeps both performance and interpretability. CLMN represents
concepts as continuous, human-readable embeddings and applies fuzzy-logic
reasoning to learn adaptive interaction rules that state how concepts affect
each other and the final decision. The model augments original text features
with concept-aware representations and automatically induces interpretable
logic rules. Across multiple datasets and pre-trained language models, CLMN
achieves higher accuracy than existing concept-based methods while improving
explanation quality. These results show that integrating neural representations
with symbolic reasoning in a unified concept space can yield practical,
transparent NLP systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Unilaw-R1是一个专门用于法律推理的7B参数大语言模型，通过两阶段训练策略在权威基准测试中表现优异，超越同规模模型并与更大模型性能相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理型大语言模型在法律领域的复杂问题处理能力尚未充分探索，需要解决法律知识不足、推理逻辑不可靠和业务泛化能力弱等核心挑战。

Method: 构建高质量法律推理数据集Unilaw-R1-Data（17K CoT样本），采用监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在权威基准测试中表现优异，超越所有同规模模型，与DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B（54.9%）性能相当；在LawBench和LexEval上平均超越Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct（46.6%）6.6%。

Conclusion: Unilaw-R1证明了轻量级模型通过专门训练可以在法律推理任务中取得优异表现，为法律AI应用提供了可解释的决策支持。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across
various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems
remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language
model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter
scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively
tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal
knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To
address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset
containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on
this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the
performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable
decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we
also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate
models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates
strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar
scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it
also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding
Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

*Wenqing Wang,Muhammad Asif Ali,Ali Shoker,Ruohan Yang,Junyang Chen,Ying Sha,Huan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A-IPO是一种自适应意图驱动的偏好优化方法，通过推断用户提示的潜在意图并将其纳入奖励函数，解决了现有对齐方法忽视少数观点和用户潜在意图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法如DPO往往默认采用多数观点，忽视了少数意见，且无法捕捉用户提示中的潜在意图。人类偏好具有多样性和动态性，受地区、文化和社会因素影响。

Method: A-IPO引入意图模块推断用户提示的潜在意图，并将推断的意图显式纳入奖励函数。通过意图-响应相似性项增加偏好边际，在理论上和经验上都证明能比DPO更清晰地区分偏好和非偏好响应。

Result: A-IPO在三个基准测试中显著优于现有基线：在Real-pref上赢得率提升24.8%，响应意图一致性提升45.6%；在Attack-pref上响应相似性提升38.6%，防御成功率提升52.2%；在GlobalOpinionQA-Ext上意图一致性得分提升54.6%。

Conclusion: A-IPO通过显式建模多样化用户意图，促进了多元偏好优化，同时增强了偏好对齐的对抗鲁棒性，在关键指标上持续超越现有基线方法。

Abstract: Human preferences are diverse and dynamic, shaped by regional, cultural, and
social factors. Existing alignment methods like Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) and its variants often default to majority views, overlooking minority
opinions and failing to capture latent user intentions in prompts.
  To address these limitations, we introduce \underline{\textbf{A}}daptive
\textbf{\underline{I}}ntent-driven \textbf{\underline{P}}reference
\textbf{\underline{O}}ptimization (\textbf{A-IPO}). Specifically,A-IPO
introduces an intention module that infers the latent intent behind each user
prompt and explicitly incorporates this inferred intent into the reward
function, encouraging stronger alignment between the preferred model's
responses and the user's underlying intentions. We demonstrate, both
theoretically and empirically, that incorporating an intention--response
similarity term increases the preference margin (by a positive shift of
$\lambda\,\Delta\mathrm{sim}$ in the log-odds), resulting in clearer separation
between preferred and dispreferred responses compared to DPO.
  For evaluation, we introduce two new benchmarks, Real-pref, Attack-pref along
with an extended version of an existing dataset, GlobalOpinionQA-Ext, to assess
real-world and adversarial preference alignment.
  Through explicit modeling of diverse user intents,A-IPO facilitates
pluralistic preference optimization while simultaneously enhancing adversarial
robustness in preference alignment. Comprehensive empirical evaluation
demonstrates that A-IPO consistently surpasses existing baselines, yielding
substantial improvements across key metrics: up to +24.8 win-rate and +45.6
Response-Intention Consistency on Real-pref; up to +38.6 Response Similarity
and +52.2 Defense Success Rate on Attack-pref; and up to +54.6 Intention
Consistency Score on GlobalOpinionQA-Ext.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PerAugy数据增强技术，通过跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动，显著提升了四个最先进用户编码器的准确性，进而提高了个性化摘要框架的个性化程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化摘要面临训练数据稀缺的挑战，现有MS/CAS PENS数据集缺乏目标摘要且主题转换多样性有限，无法支持端到端监督学习。

Method: 提出PerAugy数据增强技术，包含跨轨迹混洗和摘要内容扰动，并引入三个数据集多样性指标（TP、RTC、DegreeD）来量化增强后的多样性。

Result: PerAugy显著提升了四个SOTA用户编码器的准确性（最佳结果：AUC提升0.132），并使两个SOTA摘要框架的个性化程度平均提升61.2%（基于PSE-SU4指标）。

Conclusion: 数据集多样性是驱动性能提升的关键因素，TP和DegreeD指标与用户编码器性能在所有准确度指标上都表现出强相关性。

Abstract: Document summarization enables efficient extraction of user-relevant content
but is inherently shaped by individual subjectivity, making it challenging to
identify subjective salient information in multifaceted documents. This
complexity underscores the necessity for personalized summarization. However,
training models for personalized summarization has so far been challenging,
particularly because diverse training data containing both user preference
history (i.e., click-skip trajectory) and expected (gold-reference) summaries
are scarce. The MS/CAS PENS dataset is a valuable resource but includes only
preference history without target summaries, preventing end-to-end supervised
learning, and its limited topic-transition diversity further restricts
generalization. To address this, we propose $\mathrm{PerAugy}$, a novel
cross-trajectory shuffling and summary-content perturbation based data
augmentation technique that significantly boosts the accuracy of four
state-of-the-art baseline (SOTA) user-encoders commonly used in personalized
summarization frameworks (best result: $\text{0.132}$$\uparrow$ w.r.t AUC). We
select two such SOTA summarizer frameworks as baselines and observe that when
augmented with their corresponding improved user-encoders, they consistently
show an increase in personalization (avg. boost: $\text{61.2\%}\uparrow$ w.r.t.
PSE-SU4 metric). As a post-hoc analysis of the role of induced diversity in the
augmented dataset by \peraugy, we introduce three dataset diversity metrics --
$\mathrm{TP}$, $\mathrm{RTC}$, and \degreed\ to quantify the induced diversity.
We find that $\mathrm{TP}$ and $\mathrm{DegreeD}$ strongly correlate with
user-encoder performance on the PerAugy-generated dataset across all accuracy
metrics, indicating that increased dataset diversity is a key factor driving
performance gains.

TL;DR: REFRAIN是一个无需训练的自适应推理停止框架，通过识别冗余推理步骤来减少20-55%的token使用，同时保持或提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但过度或冗余的推理会增加推理成本并导致错误结论，需要解决"过度思考"问题。

Method: REFRAIN整合了两阶段停止判别器来识别反射性但冗余的推理，以及滑动窗口上置信区间多臂老虎机控制器来动态调整停止阈值。

Result: 在四个代表性基准测试和两个模型系列上，REFRAIN相比标准CoT提示减少了20-55%的token使用，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了"何时停止"作为测试时扩展的新实用维度，使模型能够进行恰到好处的推理而非过度推理。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has driven recent gains of large language
models (LLMs) on reasoning-intensive tasks by externalizing intermediate steps.
However, excessive or redundant reasoning -- so-called overthinking -- can
increase inference costs and lead LLMs toward incorrect conclusions. In this
paper, we present REFRAIN ($\underline{REF}$lective-$\underline{R}$edundancy
for $\underline{A}$daptive $\underline{IN}$ference), a training-free framework
that adaptively determines when to stop reasoning to mitigate overthinking.
REFRAIN integrates a two-stage stop discriminator to identify reflective yet
redundant reasoning and a sliding-window Upper Confidence Bound (SW-UCB)
multi-armed bandit controller to dynamically adjust stopping thresholds
according to problem difficulty without supervision or fine-tuning. Across four
representative benchmarks and two model families, REFRAIN reduces token usage
by 20-55% while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to standard CoT
prompting. Extensive ablation and robustness analyses demonstrate its stability
across models, scorers, and prompt variations. In summary, our findings
highlight when-to-stop as a new and practical axis of test-time scaling --
enabling models to reason not just more, but just enough.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在处理大规模非结构化语料时效果有限，而现有的图增强RAG方法依赖不稳定且成本高昂的关系提取，导致图质量差、检索性能下降。

Method: 使用轻量级实体提取和语义链接构建无关系的层次化Tri-Graph，采用两阶段检索策略：通过局部语义桥接激活相关实体，再通过全局重要性聚合进行段落检索。

Result: 在四个数据集上的广泛实验表明，LinearRAG显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: LinearRAG提供了一种经济可靠的图构建方法，避免了不稳定关系建模，实现了高效的检索增强生成。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely used to mitigate
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging external
knowledge. While effective for simple queries, traditional RAG systems struggle
with large-scale, unstructured corpora where information is fragmented. Recent
advances incorporate knowledge graphs to capture relational structures,
enabling more comprehensive retrieval for complex, multi-hop reasoning tasks.
However, existing graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) methods rely on unstable and
costly relation extraction for graph construction, often producing noisy graphs
with incorrect or inconsistent relations that degrade retrieval quality. In
this paper, we revisit the pipeline of existing GraphRAG systems and propose
LinearRAG (Linear Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation), an efficient
framework that enables reliable graph construction and precise passage
retrieval. Specifically, LinearRAG constructs a relation-free hierarchical
graph, termed Tri-Graph, using only lightweight entity extraction and semantic
linking, avoiding unstable relation modeling. This new paradigm of graph
construction scales linearly with corpus size and incurs no extra token
consumption, providing an economical and reliable indexing of the original
passages. For retrieval, LinearRAG adopts a two-stage strategy: (i) relevant
entity activation via local semantic bridging, followed by (ii) passage
retrieval through global importance aggregation. Extensive experiments on four
datasets demonstrate that LinearRAG significantly outperforms baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决企业文档处理中大量结构相似内容的信息提取难题，现有方法追求通用解决方案但效果有限，需要利用文档特定特征进行优化。

Method: 结合OCR引擎和LLM，实现三种提取范式（直接、替换、表格），通过智能策略选择和格式感知路由处理异构文档流。

Result: 表格提取方法表现最佳：结构化文档F1=1.0，延迟0.97s；图像输入F1=0.997，延迟0.6s（使用PaddleOCR），相比多模态方法性能提升54倍。

Conclusion: 重复性文档任务可以通过结构感知方法选择将计算负担转化为优化机会，为类似任务建立通用原则。

Abstract: Information extraction from copy-heavy documents, characterized by massive
volumes of structurally similar content, represents a critical yet understudied
challenge in enterprise document processing. We present a systematic framework
that strategically combines OCR engines with Large Language Models (LLMs) to
optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off inherent in repetitive document
extraction tasks. Unlike existing approaches that pursue universal solutions,
our method exploits document-specific characteristics through intelligent
strategy selection. We implement and evaluate 25 configurations across three
extraction paradigms (direct, replacement, and table-based) on identity
documents spanning four formats (PNG, DOCX, XLSX, PDF). Through table-based
extraction methods, our adaptive framework delivers outstanding results: F1=1.0
accuracy with 0.97s latency for structured documents, and F1=0.997 accuracy
with 0.6 s for challenging image inputs when integrated with PaddleOCR, all
while maintaining sub-second processing speeds. The 54 times performance
improvement compared with multimodal methods over naive approaches, coupled
with format-aware routing, enables processing of heterogeneous document streams
at production scale. Beyond the specific application to identity extraction,
this work establishes a general principle: the repetitive nature of copy-heavy
tasks can be transformed from a computational burden into an optimization
opportunity through structure-aware method selection.

TL;DR: DiffHeads是一个轻量级的LLM去偏框架，通过识别和选择性屏蔽偏见注意力头来减少模型不公平性，在DA和CoT提示下分别减少49.4%和40.3%的不公平性，同时保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作主要关注偏见输出的出现时机，但缺乏对生成机制的深入理解，导致现有缓解方法脆弱。需要系统研究LLM不公平性的机制并开发有效的去偏方法。

Method: 1) 比较DA和CoT提示策略对偏见的影响；2) 定义token-to-head贡献分数追踪偏见来源；3) 提出DiffHeads框架，通过DA和CoT的差异激活分析识别偏见头，并选择性屏蔽这些头。

Result: DA提示会触发LLM的自然偏见部分，使不公平性增加534.5%-391.9%；发现一小簇偏见头在DA下激活但在CoT下休眠；DiffHeads在DA和CoT下分别减少49.4%和40.3%的不公平性。

Conclusion: DiffHeads提供了首个提示策略与偏见出现之间的因果联系，通过轻量级选择性屏蔽偏见头的方法有效减少LLM不公平性，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly mediate decisions in domains where
unfair treatment of demographic groups is unacceptable. Existing work probes
when biased outputs appear, but gives little insight into the mechanisms that
generate them, leaving existing mitigations largely fragile. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic investigation LLM unfairness and propose DiffHeads, a
lightweight debiasing framework for LLMs. We first compare Direct-Answer (DA)
prompting to Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting across eight representative open-
and closed-source LLMs. DA will trigger the nature bias part of LLM and improve
measured unfairness by 534.5%-391.9% in both one-turn and two-turn dialogues.
Next, we define a token-to-head contribution score that traces each token's
influence back to individual attention heads. This reveals a small cluster of
bias heads that activate under DA but stay largely dormant with CoT, providing
the first causal link between prompting strategy and bias emergence. Finally,
building on this insight, we propose DiffHeads that identifies bias heads
through differential activation analysis between DA and CoT, and selectively
masks only those heads. DiffHeads reduces unfairness by 49.4%, and 40.3% under
DA and CoT, respectively, without harming model utility.

Abstract: Multi-LLM systems enhance the creativity of large language models by

expertise, within a single model. BILLY operates by extracting and blending
multiple distinct persona vectors directly in the model's activation space. We
steer the model's generation process with this merged vector while inference,
enabling multi-perspective output without explicit multi-LLM communication. Our
experiments across creativity-oriented benchmarks demonstrate that BILLY
surpasses single model prompting and traditional multi-LLM approaches, while
substantially reducing inference time and computational costs. Our analyses
further reveal that distinct persona vectors can be blended to achieve both
effective control over complementary aspects of generation and greater
interpretability.

TL;DR: 该论文系统调查了LLM生成内容的溯源追踪，从模型和数据两个视角构建了四维框架，并提出先验和后验双范式分类法，旨在提升LLM部署的透明度、问责制和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM从支持客观任务转向赋能主观决策，其部署带来了多方面风险（如幻觉、偏见、不公平、版权侵权）。由于LLM的黑盒特性和生成内容的人类化质量，从多角度追踪信息源变得至关重要。

Method: 构建了四维溯源框架：模型视角（模型溯源、模型结构溯源）和数据视角（训练数据溯源、外部数据溯源），并提出先验式（主动嵌入可追溯性）和后验式（回溯推理）双范式分类法。

Result: 提出了系统化的LLM生成内容溯源追踪框架，涵盖了从模型整体到内部结构、从训练数据到外部数据的全方位溯源维度，为增强LLM透明度提供了方法论基础。

Conclusion: 跨维度的可追溯性能够显著提升LLM在现实应用中的透明度、问责制和可信度，为负责任AI部署提供了重要技术支撑。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized
artificial intelligence, shifting from supporting objective tasks (e.g.,
recognition) to empowering subjective decision-making (e.g., planning,
decision). This marks the dawn of general and powerful AI, with applications
spanning a wide range of fields, including programming, education, healthcare,
finance, and law. However, their deployment introduces multifaceted risks. Due
to the black-box nature of LLMs and the human-like quality of their generated
content, issues such as hallucinations, bias, unfairness, and copyright
infringement become particularly significant. In this context, sourcing
information from multiple perspectives is essential.
  This survey presents a systematic investigation into provenance tracking for
content generated by LLMs, organized around four interrelated dimensions that
together capture both model- and data-centric perspectives. From the model
perspective, Model Sourcing treats the model as a whole, aiming to distinguish
content generated by specific LLMs from content authored by humans. Model
Structure Sourcing delves into the internal generative mechanisms, analyzing
architectural components that shape the outputs of model. From the data
perspective, Training Data Sourcing focuses on internal attribution, tracing
the origins of generated content back to the training data of model. In
contrast, External Data Sourcing emphasizes external validation, identifying
external information used to support or influence the responses of model.
Moreover, we also propose a dual-paradigm taxonomy that classifies existing
sourcing methods into prior-based (proactive traceability embedding) and
posterior-based (retrospective inference) approaches. Traceability across these
dimensions enhances the transparency, accountability, and trustworthiness of
LLMs deployment in real-world applications.

Abstract: Reasoning is an important task for large language models (LLMs). Among all
the reasoning paradigms, inductive reasoning is one of the fundamental types,
which is characterized by its particular-to-general thinking process and the
non-uniqueness of its answers. The inductive mode is crucial for knowledge
generalization and aligns better with human cognition, so it is a fundamental
mode of learning, hence attracting increasing interest. Despite the importance
of inductive reasoning, there is no systematic summary of it. Therefore, this
paper presents the first comprehensive survey of inductive reasoning for LLMs.
First, methods for improving inductive reasoning are categorized into three
main areas: post-training, test-time scaling, and data augmentation. Then,
current benchmarks of inductive reasoning are summarized, and a unified
sandbox-based evaluation approach with the observation coverage metric is
derived. Finally, we offer some analyses regarding the source of inductive
ability and how simple model architectures and data help with inductive tasks,
providing a solid foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的多智能体医疗咨询系统评估通常只关注最终答案准确性，忽视了内部协作过程的可解释性，这在高风险医疗应用中存在严重风险。

Method: 对六个医疗数据集和六个代表性多智能体框架的3600个案例进行大规模实证研究，采用结合定性分析和定量审计的混合方法。

Result: 定量审计揭示了四种主要失败模式：共享模型缺陷驱动的错误共识、正确少数意见被压制、无效讨论动态以及合成过程中的关键信息丢失。

Conclusion: 仅靠高准确性不足以建立临床或公众信任，迫切需要透明可审计的推理过程，这是医疗AI负责任开发和部署的基石。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems show promise in
simulating medical consultations, their evaluation is often confined to
final-answer accuracy. This practice treats their internal collaborative
processes as opaque "black boxes" and overlooks a critical question: is a
diagnostic conclusion reached through a sound and verifiable reasoning pathway?
The inscrutable nature of these systems poses a significant risk in high-stakes
medical applications, potentially leading to flawed or untrustworthy
conclusions. To address this, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 3,600
cases from six medical datasets and six representative multi-agent frameworks.
Through a rigorous, mixed-methods approach combining qualitative analysis with
quantitative auditing, we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of collaborative
failure modes. Our quantitative audit reveals four dominant failure patterns:
flawed consensus driven by shared model deficiencies, suppression of correct
minority opinions, ineffective discussion dynamics, and critical information
loss during synthesis. This study demonstrates that high accuracy alone is an
insufficient measure of clinical or public trust. It highlights the urgent need
for transparent and auditable reasoning processes, a cornerstone for the
responsible development and deployment of medical AI.

Motivation: 现实场景中训练数据往往包含噪声标签，传统方法选择小损失样本进行训练，但初始选择不准确会形成恶性循环，导致性能下降。

Method: 引入干净LoRA和噪声LoRA建立噪声标签检测器，利用记忆效应让干净LoRA记忆干净数据，噪声LoRA记忆误标数据，作为选择干净和噪声样本的可学习阈值。

Result: 在合成和真实噪声数据集上的实验结果表明，Delora在噪声标签检测和文本分类任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Delora通过解耦样本选择和模型训练，有效解决了噪声标签学习中的恶性循环问题，提高了PEFT在噪声环境下的性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) large language models (LLMs) have
shown impressive performance in various downstream tasks. However, in many
real-world scenarios, the collected training data inevitably contains noisy
labels. To learn from noisy labels, most solutions select samples with small
losses for model training. However, the selected samples, in turn, impact the
loss computation in the next iteration. An inaccurate initial selection can
create a vicious cycle, leading to suboptimal performance. To break this cycle,
we propose Delora, a novel framework that decouples the sample selection from
model training. For sample selection, Delora establishes a noisy label detector
by introducing clean and noisy LoRA. Benefiting from the memory effect, the
clean LoRA is encouraged to memorize clean data, while the noisy LoRA is
constrained to memorize mislabeled data, which serves as a learnable threshold
for selecting clean and noisy samples. For model training, Delora can use
carefully selected samples to fine-tune language models seamlessly.
Experimental results on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Delora in noisy label detection and text classification.

TL;DR: SyTTA是一个无需标注数据的推理时适应框架，通过结合输入侧困惑度和输出侧预测熵来应对语言模型在领域分布偏移下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在专业领域部署时面临训练数据分布偏移问题，而领域特定微调需要高质量标注数据，这在专家资源有限的环境中成本高昂且收集缓慢。

Method: SyTTA耦合两种互补的不确定性信号：输入侧困惑度（反映领域特定术语和模式的不匹配）和输出侧预测熵（反映生成过程中令牌概率的扩散和不稳定性），在推理时进行无监督适应。

Result: 在不同模型架构和领域特定基准测试中，SyTTA带来一致性能提升。在农业问答任务上，Qwen-2.5-7B模型的Rouge-LSum指标提升了120%以上，每个查询仅需4个额外令牌。

Conclusion: 无需标注示例即可实现有效的语言模型测试时适应，支持在标注稀缺领域中的部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in specialized domains
such as finance, medicine, and agriculture, where they face significant
distribution shifts from their training data. Domain-specific fine-tuning can
mitigate this challenge but relies on high-quality labeled data that is
expensive and slow to collect in expertise-limited settings. We study
label-free test-time adaptation for language models and present SyTTA, an
inference-time framework that adapts models on-the-fly without additional
supervision. SyTTA couples two complementary uncertainty signals that arise
under distribution shift: input-side perplexity, indicating mismatch with
domain-specific terminology and patterns, and output-side predictive entropy,
indicating diffuse and unstable token probabilities during generation. Across
diverse model architectures and domain-specific benchmarks, SyTTA delivers
consistent gains. Notably, on agricultural question answering, SyTTA improves
Rouge-LSum by over 120% on Qwen-2.5-7B with only 4 extra tokens per query.
These results show that effective test-time adaptation for language models is
achievable without labeled examples, supporting deployment in label-scarce
domains. The code will be made available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Text2Token为无监督文本表示学习提供了新的思路，证明了词汇和表示空间能够共同优化达到最优解，为未来工作提供了新见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised text representation learning (TRL) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing, which is beneficial for improving search and
recommendations with the web's unlabeled texts. A recent empirical study finds
that the high-quality representation aligns with the key token of the input
text, uncovering the potential connection between representation space and
vocabulary space. Inspired by the findings, we revisit the generative tasks and
develop an unsupervised generative framework for TRL, Text2Token. The framework
is based on the token target prediction task, utilizing carefully constructed
target token distribution as supervisory signals. To construct the high-quality
target token distribution, we analyze the token-alignment properties with
advanced embedders and identify two essential categories of key tokens: (1) the
meaningful tokens in the text and (2) semantically derived tokens beyond the
text. Based on these insights, we propose two methods -- data-driven and
model-derived -- to construct synthetic token targets from data or the LLM
backbone. Experiments on the MTEB v2 benchmark demonstrate that Text2Token
achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art embedder with
unsupervised contrastive learning, LLM2Vec. Our analysis further shows that
vocabulary and representation spaces optimize together and toward the optimum
solution during training, providing new ideas and insights for future work.

Motivation: 解决指代消解研究中的关键困境：是继续探索基于小语言模型的监督神经方法，还是拥抱大语言模型的能力。有效结合两者优势的研究仍不足。

Method: 1. 改进的监督方法ImCoref：引入轻量级桥接模块增强长文本编码能力，设计双仿射评分器全面捕捉位置信息，采用混合提及正则化提高训练效率；2. LLM作为多角色检查器-分割器代理：验证候选提及（过滤无效项）和指代结果（分割错误簇）。

Result: 大量实验证明ImCoref-CeS的有效性，相比现有最先进方法实现了更优性能。

Conclusion: 成功整合监督神经方法与LLM推理能力，为指代消解任务提供了有效的混合解决方案，在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Coreference Resolution (CR) is a critical task in Natural Language Processing
(NLP). Current research faces a key dilemma: whether to further explore the
potential of supervised neural methods based on small language models, whose
detect-then-cluster pipeline still delivers top performance, or embrace the
powerful capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively
combining their strengths remains underexplored. To this end, we propose
\textbf{ImCoref-CeS}, a novel framework that integrates an enhanced supervised
model with LLM-based reasoning. First, we present an improved CR method
(\textbf{ImCoref}) to push the performance boundaries of the supervised neural
method by introducing a lightweight bridging module to enhance long-text
encoding capability, devising a biaffine scorer to comprehensively capture
positional information, and invoking a hybrid mention regularization to improve
training efficiency. Importantly, we employ an LLM acting as a multi-role
Checker-Splitter agent to validate candidate mentions (filtering out invalid
ones) and coreference results (splitting erroneous clusters) predicted by
ImCoref. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ImCoref-CeS,
which achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 提出审计理解框架(AoU)，通过分解查询、验证前提、约束推理来减少大语言模型中的推理诱导幻觉，在数学推理任务上显著提升准确性和忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常生成看似连贯但基于未经证实假设的推理轨迹，导致幻觉结论。现有工作主要处理事实性幻觉或依赖事后验证，未能有效解决推理诱导的幻觉问题。

Method: 审计理解框架包含三个阶段：(1)将查询分解为候选假设，(2)审计这些假设的支持证据，(3)仅基于已验证的子集进行推理。该方法在形式上属于后验约束推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MultiArith和SVAMP数据集上，AoU相比Chain-of-Thought、Self-Consistency和CoT-Decoding方法，准确性和忠实性均有显著提升：GSM8K提升达+30%，MultiArith提升+45%，SVAMP提升20-28%。

Conclusion: 审计理解框架通过约束推理于已验证前提，有效减少了推理诱导的幻觉，在理论和实证上都证明了其有效性，为改善大语言模型的推理可靠性提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate reasoning traces that appear
coherent but rest on unsupported assumptions, leading to hallucinated
conclusions. Prior work mainly addresses factual hallucinations or relies on
post-hoc verification, leaving reasoning-induced hallucinations largely
unaddressed. We propose Audit-of-Understanding (AoU), a framework that
constrains inference to validated premises through three phases: (1)
decomposing a query into candidate assumptions, (2) auditing their support, and
(3) conditioning inference only on the validated subset. Formally, AoU is
\emph{posterior-constrained inference}, connecting to selective prediction and
rejection learning. Our contributions are threefold: (i) theoretical guarantees
under perfect validation, (ii) excess-risk bounds under imperfect audits, and
(iii) tractability analysis. Empirically, AoU improves both accuracy and
faithfulness on GSM8K, MultiArith, and SVAMP, achieving up to +30% gains on
GSM8K, +45% on MultiArith, and consistent +20--28% improvements on SVAMP over
Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and CoT-Decoding. Code is available at

Motivation: 后门攻击对大型语言模型构成重大威胁，现有防御方法依赖不切实际的触发器设置假设，需要开发无需先验知识的防御方案。

Method: 基于后门在表示空间聚合的关键观察，采用两阶段过程：首先通过注入已知触发器聚合后门表示，然后进行恢复微调来恢复良性输出。

Result: 在多个LLM架构上的实验表明：攻击成功率降至4.41%，优于现有基线28.1%~69.3%；清洁准确率和实用性保持在原始模型的0.5%以内；防御方法对不同类型的后门具有泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该防御框架在实际部署场景中具有鲁棒性，能有效防御后门攻击且对模型正常功能影响极小。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks are a significant threat to large language models (LLMs),
often embedded via public checkpoints, yet existing defenses rely on
impractical assumptions about trigger settings. To address this challenge, we
propose \ourmethod, a defense framework that requires no prior knowledge of
trigger settings. \ourmethod is based on the key observation that when
deliberately injecting known backdoors into an already-compromised model, both
existing unknown and newly injected backdoors aggregate in the representation
space. \ourmethod leverages this through a two-stage process: \textbf{first},
aggregating backdoor representations by injecting known triggers, and
\textbf{then}, performing recovery fine-tuning to restore benign outputs.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that: (I)
\ourmethod reduces the average Attack Success Rate to 4.41\% across multiple
benchmarks, outperforming existing baselines by 28.1\%$\sim$69.3\%$\uparrow$.
(II) Clean accuracy and utility are preserved within 0.5\% of the original
model, ensuring negligible impact on legitimate tasks. (III) The defense
generalizes across different types of backdoors, confirming its robustness in
practical deployment scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型需要在不同语言间保持事实知识的一致性，但目前对这种一致性的失败原因理解不足。作者假设这种不一致性可能源于实体对齐的失败。

Method: 通过实体级翻译任务评估对齐，并提出SubSub和SubInj两种方法，将英文实体翻译整合到不同语言的提示中。

Result: 研究发现一致性与实体对齐强相关，提出的方法显著提高了事实回忆准确性和一致性。

Conclusion: 通过机制分析发现，这些干预措施通过模型内部枢纽语言处理加强了概念空间中的实体表示对齐，为改进多语言事实预测提供了有效策略。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) are expected to recall factual
knowledge consistently across languages. However, the factors that give rise to
such crosslingual consistency -- and its frequent failure -- remain poorly
understood. In this work, we hypothesize that these inconsistencies may arise
from failures in entity alignment, the process of mapping subject and object
entities into a shared conceptual space across languages. To test this, we
assess alignment through entity-level (subject and object) translation tasks,
and find that consistency is strongly correlated with alignment across all
studied models, with misalignment of subjects or objects frequently resulting
in inconsistencies. Building on this insight, we propose SubSub and SubInj, two
effective methods that integrate English translations of subjects into prompts
across languages, leading to substantial gains in both factual recall accuracy
and consistency. Finally, our mechanistic analysis reveals that these
interventions reinforce the entity representation alignment in the conceptual
space through model's internal pivot-language processing, offering effective
and practical strategies for improving multilingual factual prediction.

Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法如DeepConf计算开销过大，需要更高效的策略来减少计算成本同时保持竞争力。

Method: 递归利用模型内在的推理、验证和总结能力，增强正确解的保留并减少Pass@k与Pass@1之间的差距。

Result: 在AIME2025上获得99.79分，仅需DeepConf 4%的计算量，在多个开源模型和挑战性多模态推理基准上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 为高级语言模型的高效可扩展测试时推理策略设计提供了新见解。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a promising paradigm in language modeling,
wherein additional computational resources are allocated during inference to
enhance model performance. Recent approaches, such as DeepConf, have
demonstrated the efficacy of this strategy, however, they often incur
substantial computational overhead to achieve competitive results. In this
work, we propose MatryoshkaThinking, a novel method that significantly reduces
computational cost while maintaining state-of-the-art performance.
Specifically, MatryoshkaThinking attains a score of 99.79 on AIME2025 using
only 4% of the computation required by DeepConf. The core of our approach lies
in the recursive exploitation of the model's intrinsic capabilities in
reasoning, verification, and summarization, which collectively enhance the
retention of correct solutions and reduce the disparity between Pass@k and
Pass@1. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple open-source models and
challenging multi-modal reasoning benchmarks validate the effectiveness and
generality of our method. These findings offer new insights into the design of
efficient and scalable test-time inference strategies for advanced language
models.

Method: 提出一个框架，通过315个独特人物角色（年龄、文化、性别的组合）对4个LLMs进行交叉分析，结合定量和定性方法。

Result: 人口属性深刻影响模型的共情反应，多重属性叠加会减弱甚至逆转预期的共情模式，模型总体上反映现实世界共情趋势，但对某些群体（如儒家文化）存在明显偏差。

Conclusion: 需要设计考虑人口多样性的共情感知LLMs，以促进更包容和公平的模型行为。

Abstract: Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to converse naturally is empowered by
their ability to empathetically understand and respond to their users. However,
emotional experiences are shaped by demographic and cultural contexts. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs demonstrate equitable empathy across
diverse user groups? We propose a framework to investigate how LLMs' cognitive
and affective empathy vary across user personas defined by intersecting
demographic attributes. Our study introduces a novel intersectional analysis
spanning 315 unique personas, constructed from combinations of age, culture,
and gender, across four LLMs. Results show that attributes profoundly shape a
model's empathetic responses. Interestingly, we see that adding multiple
attributes at once can attenuate and reverse expected empathy patterns. We show
that they broadly reflect real-world empathetic trends, with notable
misalignments for certain groups, such as those from Confucian culture. We
complement our quantitative findings with qualitative insights to uncover model
behaviour patterns across different demographic groups. Our findings highlight
the importance of designing empathy-aware LLMs that account for demographic
diversity to promote more inclusive and equitable model behaviour.

Method: 采用预训练语音编码器和大型语言模型构建端到端架构，同时执行自动语音识别和语音翻译。

Result: 在英德翻译任务中，最佳模型不仅优于SeamlessM4T，还能匹配Whisper+NLLB级联系统的性能，COMET指标提升8%。

Conclusion: 结合预训练语音编码器和大型语言模型的端到端架构在语音翻译任务中表现出色，能够超越现有端到端模型并媲美级联系统。

Abstract: Speech Translation (ST) is a machine translation task that involves
converting speech signals from one language to the corresponding text in
another language; this task has two different approaches, namely the
traditional cascade and the more recent end-to-end. This paper explores a
combined end-to-end architecture of pre-trained speech encoders and Large
Language Models (LLMs) for performing both Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
and ST simultaneously. Experiments with the English-to-German language pair
show that our best model not only can achieve better translation results than
SeamlessM4T, a large foundational end-to-end, multi-modal translation model,
but can also match the performance of a cascaded system with Whisper and NLLB,
with up to a score gain of 8% in $\text{COMET}^{\text{DA}}_{22}$ metric.

### [278] [ASC analyzer: A Python package for measuring argument structure construction usage in English texts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10384)
*Hakyung Sung,Kristopher Kyle*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个Python包ASC分析器，用于自动标注论元结构构式并计算50个指标，分析其与二语写作分数的关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论元结构构式为分析二语能力提供了理论基础，但缺乏可扩展的系统性测量工具

Method: 开发ASC分析器Python包，自动标注ASC并计算多样性、比例、频率和ASC-动词关联强度等50个指标，进行双变量和多变量分析

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体结果

Conclusion: ASC分析器填补了二语能力测量工具的空白，能够系统分析论元结构构式与写作能力的关系

Abstract: Argument structure constructions (ASCs) offer a theoretically grounded lens
for analyzing second language (L2) proficiency, yet scalable and systematic
tools for measuring their usage remain limited. This paper introduces the ASC
analyzer, a publicly available Python package designed to address this gap. The
analyzer automatically tags ASCs and computes 50 indices that capture
diversity, proportion, frequency, and ASC-verb lemma association strength. To
demonstrate its utility, we conduct both bivariate and multivariate analyses
that examine the relationship between ASC-based indices and L2 writing scores.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了语言模型在RAG系统中基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力，发现即使是前沿模型也表现不佳，拒绝准确率低于50%。作者提出了RefusalBench基准测试方法，通过程序化生成诊断测试案例来评估这一关键能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在RAG系统中基于有缺陷上下文选择性拒绝回答的能力存在显著缺陷，这对安全性至关重要，但静态基准测试无法可靠评估这一能力，因为模型会利用数据集特定伪影并记忆测试实例。

Method: 引入RefusalBench生成方法，通过受控语言扰动程序化创建诊断测试案例，采用176种不同扰动策略，涵盖六类信息不确定性和三个强度级别。

Result: 评估30多个模型发现系统性失败模式：拒绝能力包含可分离的检测和分类技能，规模和扩展推理都无法提升性能。选择性拒绝是可训练、对齐敏感的能力。

Conclusion: 选择性拒绝是可训练的对齐敏感能力，提供了明确的改进路径。发布了两个基准测试——RefusalBench-NQ（单文档）和RefusalBench-GaRAGe（多文档）以及完整的生成框架，支持对这一关键能力的持续动态评估。

Abstract: The ability of language models in RAG systems to selectively refuse to answer
based on flawed context is critical for safety, yet remains a significant
failure point. Our large-scale study reveals that even frontier models struggle
in this setting, with refusal accuracy dropping below 50% on multi-document
tasks, while exhibiting either dangerous overconfidence or overcaution. Static
benchmarks fail to reliably evaluate this capability, as models exploit
dataset-specific artifacts and memorize test instances. We introduce
RefusalBench, a generative methodology that programmatically creates diagnostic
test cases through controlled linguistic perturbation. Our framework employs
176 distinct perturbation strategies across six categories of informational
uncertainty and three intensity levels. Evaluation of over 30 models uncovers
systematic failure patterns: refusal comprises separable detection and
categorization skills, and neither scale nor extended reasoning improves
performance. We find that selective refusal is a trainable, alignment-sensitive
capability, offering a clear path for improvement. We release two benchmarks --
RefusalBench-NQ (single document) and RefusalBench-GaRAGe (multi-document) --
and our complete generation framework to enable continued, dynamic evaluation
of this critical capability.

TL;DR: AssoMem是一个新颖的关联记忆框架，通过构建关联记忆图来增强AI助手在大规模记忆中的准确召回能力，在相似密集场景下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖语义距离进行检索，但在相似密集场景中效果有限。受人类关联信息方式的启发，需要更有效的记忆检索方法。

Method: 构建关联记忆图，将对话话语锚定到自动提取的线索上；集成多维检索信号（相关性、重要性和时间对齐）；使用自适应互信息驱动的融合策略。

Result: 在三个基准测试和新引入的MeetingQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AssoMem始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AssoMem在上下文感知记忆召回方面具有优越性，验证了关联记忆图框架的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate recall from large scale memories remains a core challenge for memory
augmented AI assistants performing question answering (QA), especially in
similarity dense scenarios where existing methods mainly rely on semantic
distance to the query for retrieval. Inspired by how humans link information
associatively, we propose AssoMem, a novel framework constructing an
associative memory graph that anchors dialogue utterances to automatically
extracted clues. This structure provides a rich organizational view of the
conversational context and facilitates importance aware ranking. Further,
AssoMem integrates multi-dimensional retrieval signals-relevance, importance,
and temporal alignment using an adaptive mutual information (MI) driven fusion
strategy. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and a newly introduced
dataset, MeetingQA, demonstrate that AssoMem consistently outperforms SOTA
baselines, verifying its superiority in context-aware memory recall.

*Geunyeong Jeong,Juoh Sun,Seonghee Lee,Harksoo Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: STEAM是一个语义级别的知识编辑框架，通过语义锚点和对齐损失来增强更新知识在模型知识结构中的整合，提高推理能力和语义连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法主要关注token级似然优化，缺乏语义连贯性，导致编辑后的知识在潜在空间中形成孤立的残差流，绕过自然推理过程。

Method: STEAM首先识别目标表示作为更新事实关联的语义锚点，然后通过对齐损失在优化过程中引导编辑事实的内部表示向这些锚点对齐。

Result: 实验结果表明STEAM提高了模型使用编辑知识进行推理的能力，并增强了语义连贯性。

Conclusion: 潜在空间对齐对于可靠和连贯的知识编辑至关重要，STEAM框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models store extensive factual knowledge acquired during
large-scale pre-training. However, this knowledge is inherently static,
reflecting only the state of the world at the time of training. Knowledge
editing has emerged as a promising solution for updating outdated or incorrect
facts without full retraining. However, most existing locate-and-edit methods
primarily focus on token-level likelihood optimization without addressing
semantic coherence. Our analysis reveals that such edited knowledge is often
encoded as isolated residual streams in the model's latent space, distinct from
pre-existing knowledge and bypassing natural reasoning process. To address
this, we propose \textsc{Steam}, a semantic-level knowledge editing framework
that enhances integration of updated knowledge into the model's knowledge
structure. \textsc{Steam} first identifies target representations as semantic
anchors for the updated factual association, then guides the internal
representation of the edited fact towards these anchors through an alignment
loss during optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that \textsc{Steam}
improves model's ability to reason with edited knowledge and enhances semantic
coherence, underscoring the importance of latent-space alignment for reliable
and coherent knowledge editing. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongQAEval是一个用于评估长格式临床问答系统的框架，通过比较粗粒度答案级和细粒度句子级评估，发现在正确性维度上细粒度标注更好，相关性维度上粗粒度更好，安全性判断仍不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估长格式临床问答系统需要医学专业知识且资源密集，难以获得一致的人类判断。

Method: 基于医生对300个真实患者问题的标注，比较了答案级和句子级评估在正确性、相关性和安全性三个维度上的表现。

Result: 不同维度的标注者间一致性不同：细粒度标注在正确性上更好，粗粒度在相关性上更好，安全性判断仍不一致。仅标注少量句子即可获得与粗粒度标注相当的可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出了针对有限资源和高专业要求环境的评估建议，细粒度句子级标注在正确性评估中更有效，而相关性评估适合粗粒度方法。

Abstract: Evaluating long-form clinical question answering (QA) systems is
resource-intensive and challenging: accurate judgments require medical
expertise and achieving consistent human judgments over long-form text is
difficult. We introduce LongQAEval, an evaluation framework and set of
evaluation recommendations for limited-resource and high-expertise settings.
Based on physician annotations of 300 real patient questions answered by
physicians and LLMs, we compare coarse answer-level versus fine-grained
sentence-level evaluation over the dimensions of correctness, relevance, and
safety. We find that inter-annotator agreement (IAA) varies by dimension:
fine-grained annotation improves agreement on correctness, coarse improves
agreement on relevance, and judgments on safety remain inconsistent.
Additionally, annotating only a small subset of sentences can provide
reliability comparable to coarse annotations, reducing cost and effort.

*Jingyi Chen,Zhimeng Guo,Jiyun Chun,Pichao Wang,Andrew Perrault,Micha Elsner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LISTEN基准测试显示当前大型音频语言模型在情感理解中主要依赖词汇线索而非声学特征，存在词汇主导现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在厘清大型音频语言模型是否真正处理声学信息，还是主要依赖词汇内容进行情感理解。

Method: 开发LISTEN基准测试，通过控制词汇和声学线索的对比设置来评估6个最先进的大型音频语言模型。

Result: 模型在词汇线索中性或缺失时预测"中性"，线索对齐时改进有限，线索冲突时无法区分不同情感，副语言场景下表现接近随机。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型更多是"转录"而非"倾听"，过度依赖词汇语义而未能充分利用声学线索。

Abstract: Understanding emotion from speech requires sensitivity to both lexical and
acoustic cues. However, it remains unclear whether large audio language models
(LALMs) genuinely process acoustic information or rely primarily on lexical
content. We present LISTEN (Lexical vs. Acoustic Speech Test for Emotion in
Narratives), a controlled benchmark designed to disentangle lexical reliance
from acoustic sensitivity in emotion understanding. Across evaluations of six
state-of-the-art LALMs, we observe a consistent lexical dominance. Models
predict "neutral" when lexical cues are neutral or absent, show limited gains
under cue alignment, and fail to classify distinct emotions under cue conflict.
In paralinguistic settings, performance approaches chance. These results
indicate that current LALMs largely "transcribe" rather than "listen," relying
heavily on lexical semantics while underutilizing acoustic cues. LISTEN offers
a principled framework for assessing emotion understanding in multimodal
models.

TL;DR: RECON框架通过集成显式摘要模块压缩检索证据，在推理循环中减少35%上下文长度，提升训练速度和推理延迟，同时提高RAG在QA基准上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于强化学习的检索增强生成系统存在上下文管理效率低下的问题，冗长嘈杂的检索文档会增加成本并降低性能。

Method: 引入RECON框架，集成显式摘要模块压缩证据。摘要器通过两阶段训练：在QA数据集上进行相关性预训练，然后从专有LLMs进行多方面蒸馏以确保事实性和清晰度。

Result: 在Search-R1管道中，RECON减少35%总上下文长度，3B模型的平均EM分数提升14.5%，7B模型提升3.0%，在多跳QA中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: RECON证明学习型上下文压缩对于构建实用、可扩展且高性能的RAG系统至关重要。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems trained using reinforcement
learning (RL) with reasoning are hampered by inefficient context management,
where long, noisy retrieved documents increase costs and degrade performance.
We introduce RECON (REasoning with CONdensation), a framework that integrates
an explicit summarization module to compress evidence within the reasoning
loop. Our summarizer is trained via a two-stage process: relevance pretraining
on QA datasets, followed by multi-aspect distillation from proprietary LLMs to
ensure factuality and clarity. Integrated into the Search-R1 pipeline, RECON
reduces total context length by 35\%, leading to improved training speed and
inference latency, while simultaneously improving RAG performance on downstream
QA benchmarks. Notably, it boosts the average EM score of the 3B model by
14.5\% and the 7B model by 3.0\%, showing particular strength in multi-hop QA.
RECON demonstrates that learned context compression is essential for building
practical, scalable, and performant RAG systems. Our code implementation is
made available at https://github.com/allfornancy/RECON.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文分析了大型语言模型在安全对齐过程中产生的过度拒绝问题，特别是在检索增强生成(RAG)场景下，构建了RagRefuse基准测试，并提出了SafeRAG-Steering方法来缓解过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的安全对齐导致过度拒绝问题，即模型会拒绝良性请求。在RAG场景中，查询意图和检索上下文属性都会影响拒绝行为，需要系统分析这种现象。

Method: 构建了RagRefuse基准测试，涵盖医疗、化学和开放领域，包含良性和有害查询，并控制上下文污染模式和大小。提出了SafeRAG-Steering方法，通过模型中心的嵌入干预，在推理时将嵌入区域引导到已确认的安全、非拒绝输出区域。

Result: 分析表明上下文安排/污染、查询和上下文领域以及有害文本密度会触发对良性查询的拒绝，效果取决于模型特定的对齐选择。SafeRAG-Steering方法能在保持合法拒绝的同时减少污染RAG管道中的过度拒绝。

Conclusion: RAG中的过度拒绝问题受到多种因素影响，提出的SafeRAG-Steering方法能有效缓解这一问题，在保持安全性的同时减少不必要的拒绝。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) induces over-refusals --
where LLMs decline benign requests due to aggressive safety filters. We analyze
this phenomenon in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where both the query
intent and retrieved context properties influence refusal behavior. We
construct RagRefuse, a domain-stratified benchmark spanning medical, chemical,
and open domains, pairing benign and harmful queries with controlled context
contamination patterns and sizes. Our analysis shows that context arrangement /
contamination, domain of query and context, and harmful-text density trigger
refusals even on benign queries, with effects depending on model-specific
alignment choices. To mitigate over-refusals, we introduce
\textsc{SafeRAG-Steering}, a model-centric embedding intervention that steers
the embedding regions towards the confirmed safe, non-refusing output regions
at inference time. This reduces over-refusals in contaminated RAG pipelines
while preserving legitimate refusals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTC方法在将语音下采样到与文本相似长度时无法正确对齐语音和文本，特别是在语音长度与文本长度接近的情况下。

Method: 提出时间独立性损失（TIL）和基于编辑距离的对齐交叉熵损失（AXE），并通过加权融合关键帧及其上下文2帧来增强关键帧信息。

Result: 在AISHELL-1和AISHELL-2数据集子集上的实验表明，所提方法优于先前工作，帧数减少至少86%。

Conclusion: 所提出的对齐方法和帧融合技术有效解决了语音文本长度对齐问题，显著提升了ASR性能并大幅减少了计算复杂度。

Abstract: The mismatch of speech length and text length poses a challenge in automatic
speech recognition (ASR). In previous research, various approaches have been
employed to align text with speech, including the utilization of Connectionist
Temporal Classification (CTC). In earlier work, a key frame mechanism (KFDS)
was introduced, utilizing intermediate CTC outputs to guide downsampling and
preserve keyframes, but traditional methods (CTC) failed to align speech and
text appropriately when downsampling speech to a text-similar length. In this
paper, we focus on speech recognition in those cases where the length of speech
aligns closely with that of the corresponding text. To address this issue, we
introduce two methods for alignment: a) Time Independence Loss (TIL) and b)
Aligned Cross Entropy (AXE) Loss, which is based on edit distance. To enhance
the information on keyframes, we incorporate frame fusion by applying weights
and summing the keyframe with its context 2 frames. Experimental results on
AISHELL-1 and AISHELL-2 dataset subsets show that the proposed methods
outperform the previous work and achieve a reduction of at least 86\% in the
number of frames.

Method: 首先进行样本级冗余分析，将基准压缩构建为分数重建优化问题，提出基于迭代遗传算法的粗到细框架，结合基于适应度的子集搜索和基于归因的样本搜索

Result: 在HellaSwag基准上，使用25倍更少样本时保持所有模型排名在5%内变化，使用200倍更少样本时达到95%排名保持率在5%内变化

Conclusion: 该方法相比之前方法在压缩结果、重建误差和效率方面表现更优，实现了高效的基准压缩

Abstract: As the demand for comprehensive evaluations of diverse model capabilities
steadily increases, benchmark suites have correspondingly grown significantly
in scale. Despite notable advances in redundancy reduction and subset-level
performance prediction, a systematic framework that effectively integrates
these methods to ensure both prediction accuracy and ranking consistency is
still largely elusive. In this paper, we first perform a sample-level analysis
of benchmark redundancy and identify several highly similar samples that can be
eliminated. Besides, we frame benchmark compression as an optimization problem
with the aim of score reconstruction. Building on these, we then propose
EssenceBench, a coarse-to-fine framework utilizing an iterative Genetic
Algorithm (GA), which takes the advantages of fitness-based subset search and
attribution-based sample search. Compared to previous methods, our approach
yields superior compression results with lower reconstruction error and
markedly higher efficiency. In particular, on the HellaSwag benchmark (10K
samples), our method preserves the ranking of all models shifting within 5%
using 25x fewer samples, and achieves 95% ranking preservation shifting within
5% using only 200x fewer samples.

Conclusion: 该表意元语言框架成功跨越了学术、语言和文化界限，为低学历人群提供了有效的数字通信解决方案。

Abstract: Digital communication has become the cornerstone of modern interaction,
enabling rapid, accessible, and interactive exchanges. However, individuals
with lower academic literacy often face significant barriers, exacerbating the
"digital divide". In this work, we introduce a novel, universal ideographic
metalanguage designed as an innovative communication framework that transcends
academic, linguistic, and cultural boundaries. Our approach leverages
principles of Neuro-symbolic AI, combining neural-based large language models
(LLMs) enriched with world knowledge and symbolic knowledge heuristics grounded
in the linguistic theory of Natural Semantic Metalanguage (NSM). This enables
the semantic decomposition of complex ideas into simpler, atomic concepts.
Adopting a human-centric, collaborative methodology, we engaged over 200
semi-literate participants in defining the problem, selecting ideographs, and
validating the system. With over 80\% semantic comprehensibility, an accessible
learning curve, and universal adaptability, our system effectively serves
underprivileged populations with limited formal education.

Conclusion: FML-bench提供了一个全面评估自动机器学习研究代理的基准，发现研究探索的广度对研究效果至关重要，该基准可用于推动自动机器学习研究的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in automatic
machine learning research agents. Among them, agents capable of autonomously
proposing ideas and conducting machine learning experiments are particularly
promising, as they maximize research automation and accelerate scientific
progress by iteratively refining ideas based on experimental results. However,
comprehensively evaluating such agents remains challenging. Existing benchmarks
tend to overemphasize engineering aspects while neglecting academic rigor,
creating barriers that obscure a clear assessment of an agent's scientific
capabilities in machine learning research. They also suffer from limited task
diversity, an overemphasis on application-oriented tasks over fundamental
research problems, and limited scalability to realistic research settings. To
address these limitations, we introduce FML-bench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate automatic machine learning research agents on 8 diverse and
fundamental machine learning research problems. It reduces coding burden,
emphasizes fundamental problems rather than specific use cases, offers high
task diversity, and is extensible to real-world machine learning GitHub
repositories. Furthermore, we present a unified evaluation framework with five
complementary metrics, designed to comprehensively assess agent performance on
our benchmark. We evaluate state-of-the-art automatic research agents on
FML-bench, and find that agents employing broad research exploration strategies
outperform those focusing on narrow but deep exploration. These findings
suggest that emphasizing the breadth of exploration may lead to more effective
research outcomes than focusing solely on incremental refinement. Our benchmark

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字服务经济中，理解什么驱动流行度至关重要。以往研究主要关注内容特征，但创作者经常误判观众真正重视的内容。

Method: 应用潜在狄利克雷分配(LDA)模型分析大量TED演讲数据，比较创作者的主题供给与观众参与度表达的需求。

Result: 识别出创作者供给与消费者偏好之间的持续不匹配，纵向分析显示时间动态比主题内容对消费者参与度的影响更强。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了内容特征是流行度主要驱动因素的假设，强调时间和情境因素在塑造消费者响应中的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding what drives popularity is critical in today's digital service
economy, where content creators compete for consumer attention. Prior studies
have primarily emphasized the role of content features, yet creators often
misjudge what audiences actually value. This study applies Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA) modeling to a large corpus of TED Talks, treating the platform
as a case of digital service provision in which creators (speakers) and
consumers (audiences) interact. By comparing the thematic supply of creators
with the demand expressed in audience engagement, we identify persistent
mismatches between producer offerings and consumer preferences. Our
longitudinal analysis further reveals that temporal dynamics exert a stronger
influence on consumer engagement than thematic content, suggesting that when
content is delivered may matter more than what is delivered. These findings
challenge the dominant assumption that content features are the primary drivers
of popularity and highlight the importance of timing and contextual factors in
shaping consumer responses. The results provide new insights into consumer
attention dynamics on digital platforms and carry practical implications for
marketers, platform managers, and content creators seeking to optimize audience
engagement strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗订单提取对于结构化临床信息、支持决策制定和实现下游应用至关重要，但订单可能嵌入在电子健康记录、出院摘要和多轮医患对话等不同来源中。

Method: 使用通用指令调优的LLaMA-4 17B模型，无需领域特定微调，仅通过单个上下文示例进行引导的少样本配置。

Result: 在17个参赛团队的105个提交中排名第5，平均F1得分为37.76，在原因和来源准确性方面有显著改进。

Conclusion: 结果表明，大型非领域特定LLM与有效提示工程相结合，可以为专门的临床NLP任务提供强大且可扩展的基线。

Abstract: Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical
information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications
such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in
diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and
multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as
medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The
MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from
extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order
type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission,
which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our
approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without
domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This
few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable
improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that
large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering,
can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks.

Motivation: 扩散LLM在长上下文行为方面的研究仍然不足，需要探索如何有效扩展其上下文窗口以适应各种下游任务。

Method: 通过改进标准的RoPE位置编码来适应扩散过程的概率建模特性，并比较不同的掩码策略对优化稳定性和长距离记忆的影响。

Result: 提出的UltraLLaDA模型在长上下文任务中显著优于无需训练的基线方法，成功实现了128K标记的上下文窗口。

Conclusion: 特殊的位置编码扩展是扩展扩散LLM上下文窗口的关键因素，为通过高效后训练实现128K规模上下文提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs have attracted growing interest, with plenty of recent work
emphasizing their great potential in various downstream tasks; yet the
long-context behavior of diffusion LLMs remains largely uncharted. We present a
case study of post-training techniques for extending the context window of
diffusion LLMs (i.e., LLaDA) without retraining from scratch. We show that a
simple modification to the standard Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)
extension effectively accommodates the probabilistic modeling inherent in the
diffusion process, enabling stable scaling to longer context ranges. We further
compare masking strategies used during post-training and analyze their impact
on optimization stability and long-range recall. Instantiating these insights,
we introduce UltraLLaDA, a diffusion LLM with a 128K-token context window that,
in our empirical evaluation on long-context tasks, significantly outperforms
training-free baselines. Our experimental results highlight the special
positional extension as a key lever for scaling diffusion LLMs to extended
contexts and offer practical guidance for practitioners seeking 128K-scale
context via efficient post-training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的OCR方法VOLTAGE，用于低资源语言的字符识别，在Takri文字上达到95%的印刷体和87%的手写体识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球7000种语言中有2500种濒危，语言消失会导致传统智慧、民间文学和社区本质的丧失。低资源语言缺乏无监督OCR方法是阻碍其数字包容的主要原因之一。

Method: 使用对比学习和自动字形特征推荐进行聚类标注，通过图像变换和生成对抗网络增强标注数据的多样性和数量。

Result: 在Takri文字上，机器印刷体识别准确率达到95%，手写体达到87%。该方法在其他印度文字（包括低资源和高资源）上也表现出通用性。

Conclusion: VOLTAGE方法有效解决了低资源语言的OCR问题，为濒危语言的数字保存提供了可行方案，并通过下游用例验证了其实用价值。

Abstract: UNESCO has classified 2500 out of 7000 languages spoken worldwide as
endangered. Attrition of a language leads to loss of traditional wisdom, folk
literature, and the essence of the community that uses it. It is therefore
imperative to bring digital inclusion to these languages and avoid its
extinction. Low resource languages are at a greater risk of extinction. Lack of
unsupervised Optical Character Recognition(OCR) methodologies for low resource
languages is one of the reasons impeding their digital inclusion. We propose
VOLTAGE - a contrastive learning based OCR methodology, leveraging auto-glyph
feature recommendation for cluster-based labelling. We augment the labelled
data for diversity and volume using image transformations and Generative
Adversarial Networks. Voltage has been designed using Takri - a family of
scripts used in 16th to 20th century in the Himalayan regions of India. We
present results for Takri along with other Indic scripts (both low and high
resource) to substantiate the universal behavior of the methodology. An
accuracy of 95% for machine printed and 87% for handwritten samples on Takri
script has been achieved. We conduct baseline and ablation studies along with
building downstream use cases for Takri, demonstrating the usefulness of our
work.

Motivation: 大型推理模型在处理复杂推理任务时存在计算延迟和开销问题，阻碍了实际部署。

Method: 提出AdvPrompt迭代优化框架，通过黑盒对抗提示从多角度生成高质量提示，引导模型给出简洁回答。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AdvPrompt平均减少40%的token使用量，Qwen3模型在GSM8K上响应长度减少3倍，Claude-3.7和Gemini-2.5在MATH-500上分别减少35%和47%的token使用。

Conclusion: 黑盒提示是一种实用有效的策略，可显著提升大型推理模型的效率，且具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in
tackling complex reasoning tasks through step-by-step thinking. However, such a
lengthy reasoning process incurs substantial computational and latency
overheads, hindering the practical deployment of these models. In this work, we
present a new perspective on mitigating overthinking in LRMs via black-box
adversarial prompting. By treating both open-source LRMs and closed-source APIs
as black-box communicators, we investigate how to elicit concise responses
without sacrificing accuracy. We introduce AdvPrompt, an iterative refinement
framework that generates high-quality adversarial prompts from diverse
perspectives. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AdvPrompt
consistently reduces token usage while preserving performance. Notably,
AdvPrompt achieves a 3x reduction in average response length on simple GSM8K
questions for the Qwen3 model series, and delivers an average ~40% token
reduction across four benchmarks. For closed-source APIs, AdvPrompt reduces
token usage on MATH-500 by 35% for Claude-3.7 and 47% for Gemini-2.5. Further
analysis reveals the generalizability of AdvPrompt across various model scales
and families, underscoring the potential of black-box prompting as a practical
and effective strategy for enhancing LRM efficiency.

TL;DR: AuthenHallu是首个完全基于真实LLM-人类对话构建的幻觉检测基准，相比人工构造的基准能更准确地反映现实使用中的幻觉特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准多为人工构造，无法真实反映LLM在实际使用中的幻觉特征，需要构建基于真实对话的基准。

Method: 从真实的LLM-人类对话中筛选并标注样本，构建AuthenHallu基准，并分析幻觉在不同领域的分布。

Result: 基准中31.4%的查询-响应对存在幻觉，在数学与数字问题等挑战性领域该比例高达60.0%。使用普通LLM作为幻觉检测器的效果在现实场景中仍不足。

Conclusion: 基于真实对话的基准能更准确地评估LLM幻觉，当前LLM作为幻觉检测器的能力仍需提升，特别是在挑战性领域。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in sensitive domains
such as medicine and law, hallucination detection has become a critical task.
Although numerous benchmarks have been proposed to advance research in this
area, most of them are artificially constructed--either through deliberate
hallucination induction or simulated interactions--rather than derived from
genuine LLM-human dialogues. Consequently, these benchmarks fail to fully
capture the characteristics of hallucinations that occur in real-world usage.
To address this limitation, we introduce AuthenHallu, the first hallucination
detection benchmark built entirely from authentic LLM-human interactions. For
AuthenHallu, we select and annotate samples from genuine LLM-human dialogues,
thereby providing a faithful reflection of how LLMs hallucinate in everyday
user interactions. Statistical analysis shows that hallucinations occur in
31.4% of the query-response pairs in our benchmark, and this proportion
increases dramatically to 60.0% in challenging domains such as Math & Number
Problems. Furthermore, we explore the potential of using vanilla LLMs
themselves as hallucination detectors and find that, despite some promise,
their current performance remains insufficient in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: BitMar是一个量化多模态transformer，使用1.58位编码器和外部情景记忆，在资源受限的硬件上实现高效的图像-文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨注意力transformer等多模态模型在边缘设备部署时面临的内存和计算资源挑战，同时结合记忆增强架构与激进的量化技术。

Method: 使用1.58位编码器（文本BitNet风格，视觉DiNOv2基础）创建紧凑嵌入，结合固定大小的键值情景记忆，采用逐层条件化和滑动窗口注意力机制。

Result: 在低延迟和小模型占用下实现了有竞争力的图像描述和多模态理解性能，达到了良好的质量-速度权衡。

Conclusion: BitMar的特性使其非常适合边缘部署，为资源受限环境下的多模态生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-attention transformers and other multimodal vision-language models
excel at grounding and generation; however, their extensive, full-precision
backbones make it challenging to deploy them on edge devices. Memory-augmented
architectures enhance the utilization of past context; however, most works
rarely pair them with aggressive edge-oriented quantization. We introduce
BitMar, a quantized multimodal transformer that proposes an external human-like
episodic memory for effective image-text generation on hardware with limited
resources. BitMar utilizes 1.58-bit encoders, one for text (BitNet-style) and
one for vision (DiNOv2-based), to create compact embeddings that are combined
and used to query a fixed-size key-value episodic memory. During vector
retrieval, the BitNet decoder applies per-layer conditioning, which increases
the contextual relevance of generated content. The decoder also employs
attention sinks with a sliding-window mechanism to process long or streaming
inputs under tight memory budgets. The combination of per-layer conditioning
and sliding-window attention achieves a strong quality-speed trade-off,
delivering competitive captioning and multimodal understanding at low latency
with a small model footprint. These characteristics make BitMar well-suited for
edge deployment.

TL;DR: 提出基于时序大语言模型的动态主题演化建模框架，通过时间衰减函数和注意力机制捕捉主题变化，在潜在主题空间中使用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化，在真实语料上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型难以有效捕捉主题在时间维度上的动态演化过程，需要系统性地建模语义表示与时间演化的统一框架。

Method: 使用大语言模型获取文本上下文嵌入，引入时间衰减函数和注意力机制调整语义单元重要性，将时序表示映射到潜在主题空间，应用状态转移矩阵描述主题动态演化，通过联合优化目标约束语义建模和时间一致性。

Result: 在真实语料上的实验表明，该框架能有效捕捉主题的生成、扩展和衰退过程，在多个指标上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为理解大规模文本中的动态语义模式提供了系统性解决方案，丰富了主题建模的研究范式，支持多领域的复杂文本分析任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a modeling framework for dynamic topic evolution based on
temporal large language models. The method first uses a large language model to
obtain contextual embeddings of text and then introduces a temporal decay
function and an attention mechanism. These components allow the model to adjust
the importance of semantic units according to time intervals and capture topic
variations across different periods. The temporal representations are then
mapped into a latent topic space, where a state transition matrix is applied to
describe the dynamic evolution of topics. A joint optimization objective
constrains both semantic modeling and temporal consistency, ensuring diversity
and smoothness in topic generation. The design emphasizes the unified modeling
of semantic representation and temporal evolution, which improves topic
coherence and diversity while enhancing stability and interpretability over
time. Experiments on real-world corpora show that the framework effectively
captures the generation, expansion, and decline of topics and outperforms
existing models across multiple metrics. Overall, the proposed method provides
a systematic solution for understanding dynamic semantic patterns in
large-scale text, enriches the research paradigm of topic modeling, and
supports complex text analysis tasks in multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然认识到校准数据对LLM压缩的重要性，但缺乏系统性分析，特别是对高层次复杂推理能力的影响机制研究不足。

Method: 从激活模式角度分析校准数据的影响机制，探索数学问题解决和代码生成等高阶推理能力，并提出基于激活空间代表性和多样性的校准数据筛选框架。

Result: 研究发现激活空间中的代表性和多样性更根本地决定了校准数据的质量，提出的数据筛选框架能够提升现有后训练压缩方法在保留关键LLM能力方面的性能。

Conclusion: 校准数据的质量对LLM压缩后的能力保持至关重要，激活空间特征为评估和筛选校准数据提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: Post-training compression has been a widely employed approach to scale down
large language model (LLM) and facilitate efficient inference. In various
proposed compression methods, including pruning and quantization, calibration
data plays a vital role by informing the weight importance and activation
dynamic ranges. However, how calibration data impacts the LLM capability after
compression is less explored. Few of the existing works, though recognizing the
significance of this study, only investigate the language modeling or
commonsense reasoning performance degradation from limited angles, like the
data sources or sample amounts. More systematic research is still needed to
examine the impacts on different LLM capabilities in terms of compositional
properties and domain correspondence of calibration data. In this work, we aim
at bridging this gap and further analyze underlying influencing mechanisms from
the activation pattern perspective. Especially, we explore the calibration
data's impacts on high-level complex reasoning capabilities, like math problem
solving and code generation. Delving into the underlying mechanism, we find
that the representativeness and diversity in activation space more
fundamentally determine the quality of calibration data. Finally, we propose a
calibration data curation framework based on such observations and analysis,
enhancing the performance of existing post-training compression methods on
preserving critical LLM capabilities. Our code is provided in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究事实陈述如何通过外部来源或证据获得可信度，填补现有研究仅关注声明检测和验证的不足。

Method: 构建了包含3,226个英文新闻句子的FactAppeal手动标注数据集，包含细粒度的认知结构和证据基础标注；使用2B-9B参数的编码器和生成式解码器模型进行建模。

Result: 基于Gemma 2 9B的最佳模型实现了0.73的宏F1分数。

Conclusion: FactAppeal数据集和提出的任务为理解事实陈述的认知基础提供了新的研究视角，模型表现显示了该任务的可行性。

Abstract: How is a factual claim made credible? We propose the novel task of Epistemic
Appeal Identification, which identifies whether and how factual statements have
been anchored by external sources or evidence. To advance research on this
task, we present FactAppeal, a manually annotated dataset of 3,226
English-language news sentences. Unlike prior resources that focus solely on
claim detection and verification, FactAppeal identifies the nuanced epistemic
structures and evidentiary basis underlying these claims and used to support
them. FactAppeal contains span-level annotations which identify factual
statements and mentions of sources on which they rely. Moreover, the
annotations include fine-grained characteristics of factual appeals such as the
type of source (e.g. Active Participant, Witness, Expert, Direct Evidence),
whether it is mentioned by name, mentions of the source's role and epistemic
credentials, attribution to the source via direct or indirect quotation, and
other features. We model the task with a range of encoder models and generative
decoder models in the 2B-9B parameter range. Our best performing model, based
on Gemma 2 9B, achieves a macro-F1 score of 0.73.

TL;DR: 该研究通过比较CNN和福克斯新闻对相同事件的报道，量化了媒体在事实报道中使用的认知策略差异，发现CNN使用更多事实陈述并引用专家，而福克斯新闻更依赖新闻报道和直接引用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然媒体偏见被广泛研究，但事实报道背后的认知策略在计算层面仍探索不足。本研究旨在通过大规模比较CNN和福克斯新闻来揭示这些策略。

Method: 采用文章匹配策略比较同一事件的报道，应用FactAppeal框架分析47万篇文章，涵盖COVID-19大流行和以色列-哈马斯战争两个高度政治化时期。

Result: CNN的报道包含更多事实陈述且更倾向于引用外部来源。两家媒体来源模式截然不同：CNN通过引用专家和专家文件构建正式权威，而福克斯新闻偏爱新闻报道和直接引用。

Conclusion: 这项研究量化了党派媒体如何使用系统性不同的认知策略来构建现实，为媒体偏见研究增添了新维度。

Abstract: While media bias is widely studied, the epistemic strategies behind factual
reporting remain computationally underexplored. This paper analyzes these
strategies through a large-scale comparison of CNN and Fox News. To isolate
reporting style from topic selection, we employ an article matching strategy to
compare reports on the same events and apply the FactAppeal framework to a
corpus of over 470K articles covering two highly politicized periods: the
COVID-19 pandemic and the Israel-Hamas war. We find that CNN's reporting
contains more factual statements and is more likely to ground them in external
sources. The outlets also exhibit sharply divergent sourcing patterns: CNN
builds credibility by citing Experts} and Expert Documents, constructing an
appeal to formal authority, whereas Fox News favors News Reports and direct
quotations. This work quantifies how partisan outlets use systematically
different epistemic strategies to construct reality, adding a new dimension to
the study of media bias.

Motivation: 传统单体架构在处理复杂推理和多样化数据库模式时存在困难，需要更灵活和可解释的解决方案。

Method: 采用多专家框架：推理智能体负责问题分解，编码智能体生成子查询，优化步骤进行列选择，自适应路由器在模块化流水线和基线解析器之间选择平衡效率与准确性。

Result: 在Spider基准测试中，使用14B参数的模型达到86.07%的执行准确率，接近GPT-4的SOTA性能（89.65%），同时提高了可解释性。

Conclusion: AGENTIQL提供了一个鲁棒、可扩展且可解释的语义解析方法，通过模块化设计和并行执行能力缩小了与大型模型之间的性能差距。

Abstract: LLMs have advanced text-to-SQL generation, yet monolithic architectures
struggle with complex reasoning and schema diversity. We propose AGENTIQL, an
agent-inspired multi-expert framework that combines a reasoning agent for
question decomposition, a coding agent for sub-query generation, and a
refinement step for column selection. An adaptive router further balances
efficiency and accuracy by selecting between our modular pipeline and a
baseline parser. Several steps in the pipeline can be executed in parallel,
making the framework scalable to larger workloads. Evaluated on the Spider
benchmark, AGENTIQL improves execution accuracy and interpretability and
achieves up to 86.07\% EX with 14B models using the Planner&Executor merging
strategy. The attained performance is contingent upon the efficacy of the
routing mechanism, thereby narrowing the gap to GPT-4-based SOTA (89.65% EX)
while using much smaller open-source LLMs. Beyond accuracy, AGENTIQL enhances
transparency by exposing intermediate reasoning steps, offering a robust,
scalable, and interpretable approach to semantic parsing.

TL;DR: BrowserAgent是一个基于人类浏览行为的交互式Web代理，通过直接操作原始网页而非依赖工具转换静态文本，在复杂任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在解决Web任务时过度依赖工具将交互式环境转换为静态文本，与人类实际浏览行为不符。需要开发更贴近人类交互方式的Web代理。

Method: 采用两阶段训练（SFT和RFT），通过预定义浏览器操作直接操作原始网页，并引入显式记忆机制存储关键结论。

Result: 在训练数据远少于Search-R1的情况下，BrowserAgent在多个Open-QA任务中表现更具竞争力，在HotpotQA等多跳QA任务上提升约20%。

Conclusion: BrowserAgent可作为更先进、交互性更强且可扩展的Web代理框架，展示了基于人类浏览行为的交互式方法的优势。

Abstract: Efficiently solving real-world problems with LLMs increasingly hinges on
their ability to interact with dynamic web environments and autonomously
acquire external information. While recent research like Search-R1 and
WebDancer demonstrates strong performance in solving web tasks, they heavily
rely on additional tools to convert the interactive web environment into static
text content. This is in contrast to human browsing behaviors, which involve
diverse interactions with the browser, such as scrolling, clicking, and typing.
In this paper, we propose BrowserAgent, a more interactive agent that solves
complex tasks through human-inspired browser actions. BrowserAgent operates
directly on raw web pages via Playwright through a set of predefined browser
actions. We adopt a two-stage training (Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Rejection Fine-Tuning (RFT)) to improve the model's generalization abilities.
Despite using significantly less training data than Search-R1, BrowserAgent
achieves more competitive results across different Open-QA tasks. Additionally,
we introduce an explicit memory mechanism to store key conclusions across
steps, further enhancing the model's reasoning capabilities for long-horizon
tasks. Notably, BrowserAgent-7B can achieve around 20\% improvement over
Search-R1 on multi-hop QA tasks like HotpotQA, 2Wiki, and Bamboogle. These
results indicate that BrowserAgent can serve as a more advanced framework for
more interactive and scalable web agents.

Result: 仅使用1000个训练样本，在6种语言的3个数据集上表现出优越性能，超越使用更多数据训练的大型模型，并展现出强大的可解释性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ConsistentGuard在少量数据下实现了优越的多语言安全防护性能，同时提供了多语言基准扩展和代码发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in LLMs have enhanced AI capabilities, but also increased the
risk posed by malicious requests, highlighting the need for effective LLM
safeguards to detect such queries. Existing approaches largely rely on
classifier-based methods that lack interpretability and perform poorly on
low-resource languages. To address these limitations, we propose
ConsistentGuard, a novel reasoning-based multilingual safeguard, which enhances
explainability via reasoning and boosts knowledge transfer between languages
through alignment. With only 1,000 training samples, our method demonstrates
superior performance on three datasets across six languages, outperforming
larger models trained with significantly more data, and exhibits strong
interpretability and generalization ability. We also contribute a multilingual
benchmark extension and release our codes to support future research.

Motivation: 前沿大语言模型的高质量预训练数据资源正在枯竭，需要开发有效的数据回收方法来扩展可用数据。

Method: 使用强化学习训练4B参数的重述模型，设计了1个质量奖励和3个忠实度奖励，优化模型生成既高质量又保持原始语义和结构的重述数据。

Result: 在400M和1.4B模型上，RePro相比纯有机数据基线在22个下游任务上获得4.7%-14.0%的相对准确率提升，数据效率提高2-3倍，优于基于提示的70B重述方法。

Conclusion: RePro为有效利用LLM预训练的"化石燃料"提供了一条高效可控的路径，能够显著提升数据利用效率。

Abstract: High-quality pretraining data is the fossil fuel of large language models
(LLMs), yet its reserves are running low for frontier models. In this paper, we
introduce RePro, a novel web recycling method that trains a relatively small LM
with reinforcement learning to generate effective and faithful rephrasings of
pretraining data. Specifically, we design one quality reward and three
faithfulness rewards, optimizing the LM rephraser to convert organic data into
high-quality rephrasings while maintaining its core semantics and structure. In
our experiment, we train a 4B rephraser to recycle 72B tokens sampled from
DCLM-RefinedWeb. Pretraining results on 400M and 1.4B models demonstrate that
RePro delivers 4.7%-14.0% relative accuracy gains over organic-only baseline on
22 downstream tasks. RePro also outperforms ReWire, the state-of-the-art web
recycling method that prompts a 70B rephraser, as well as the organic baseline
with a 4x larger data pool. Experiments with different amounts of recycled data
highlight that RePro improves organic data efficiency by 2-3x. Individual and
distributional analyses validate that RePro preserves more critical information
and faithfully reflects the characteristics of organic data compared to
prompting-based methods. Together, these results show that RePro provides an
efficient and controllable path to effectively harness the fossil fuel of LLM
pretraining. We open-source our code, rephraser, and recycled data at

information. Large language models (LLMs) offer potential for automating
methodological assessments, promising to transform evidence synthesis. Here,
using causal mediation analysis as a representative methodological domain, we
benchmarked state-of-the-art LLMs against expert human reviewers across 180
full-text scientific articles. Model performance closely correlated with human
judgments (accuracy correlation 0.71; F1 correlation 0.97), achieving
near-human accuracy on straightforward, explicitly stated methodological
criteria. However, accuracy sharply declined on complex, inference-intensive
assessments, lagging expert reviewers by up to 15%. Errors commonly resulted
from superficial linguistic cues -- for instance, models frequently
misinterpreted keywords like "longitudinal" or "sensitivity" as automatic
evidence of rigorous methodological approache, leading to systematic
misclassifications. Longer documents yielded lower model accuracy, whereas
publication year showed no significant effect. Our findings highlight an
important pattern for practitioners using LLMs for methods review and synthesis
from full texts: current LLMs excel at identifying explicit methodological
features but require human oversight for nuanced interpretations. Integrating
automated information extraction with targeted expert review thus provides a
promising approach to enhance efficiency and methodological rigor in evidence
synthesis across diverse scientific fields.

*James Ald Teves,Ray Daniel Cal,Josh Magdiel Villaluz,Jean Malolos,Mico Magtira,Ramon Rodriguez,Mideth Abisado,Joseph Marvin Imperial*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HiligayNER是首个用于希利盖农语命名实体识别的基线模型，基于8000多个标注句子构建，使用mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa微调，性能超过80%，在跨语言评估中表现出良好的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希利盖农语作为菲律宾的一种代表性语言，在语言处理研究中缺乏标注语料库和基线模型，导致其代表性不足。

Method: 从公开新闻文章、社交媒体帖子和文学文本收集8000多个标注句子，使用Transformer模型mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa进行微调。

Result: 两个模型在所有实体类型上的精确率、召回率和F1分数均超过80%，在宿务语和他加禄语的跨语言评估中显示出良好的迁移性。

Conclusion: HiligayNER为低资源环境下的多语言NLP提供了基础，有助于促进菲律宾代表性不足语言的技术发展。

Abstract: The language of Hiligaynon, spoken predominantly by the people of Panay
Island, Negros Occidental, and Soccsksargen in the Philippines, remains
underrepresented in language processing research due to the absence of
annotated corpora and baseline models. This study introduces HiligayNER, the
first publicly available baseline model for the task of Named Entity
Recognition (NER) in Hiligaynon. The dataset used to build HiligayNER contains
over 8,000 annotated sentences collected from publicly available news articles,
social media posts, and literary texts. Two Transformer-based models, mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa, were fine-tuned on this collected corpus to build versions of
HiligayNER. Evaluation results show strong performance, with both models
achieving over 80% in precision, recall, and F1-score across entity types.
Furthermore, cross-lingual evaluation with Cebuano and Tagalog demonstrates
promising transferability, suggesting the broader applicability of HiligayNER
for multilingual NLP in low-resource settings. This work aims to contribute to
language technology development for underrepresented Philippine languages,
specifically for Hiligaynon, and support future research in regional language
processing.

*Zhichao Wang,Cheng Wan,Dong Nie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统综述了推理时扩展技术，将这一新兴领域组织为输出导向和输入导向两大类方法，旨在通过部署时的额外计算来提升LLM性能，而无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高质量训练数据的日益稀缺，传统的通过扩大模型规模和训练数据来提升LLM性能的方法面临瓶颈，因此研究重点转向推理时扩展，利用部署时的额外计算来显著提升下游任务性能。

Method: 采用系统综述方法，将推理时扩展技术分为输出导向方法（包括复杂多步生成策略、推理方法、搜索解码方法、长CoT训练和模型集成）和输入导向方法（主要是少样本学习和RAG，其中RAG细分为查询扩展、数据、检索与重排序、LLM生成方法和多模态RAG）。

Result: 构建了一个全面的推理时扩展技术分类框架，系统梳理了这一快速演进领域的主要技术路线和方法论，为后续研究提供了清晰的结构化视角。

Conclusion: 推理时扩展代表了LLM发展的新范式，通过输出导向和输入导向两大技术路径，能够在无需重新训练模型的情况下显著提升LLM性能，为解决高质量训练数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The performance gains of LLMs have historically been driven by scaling up
model size and training data. However, the rapidly diminishing availability of
high-quality training data is introducing a fundamental bottleneck, shifting
the focus of research toward inference-time scaling. This paradigm uses
additional computation at the time of deployment to substantially improve LLM
performance on downstream tasks without costly model re-training. This review
systematically surveys the diverse techniques contributing to this new era of
inference-time scaling, organizing the rapidly evolving field into two
comprehensive perspectives: Output-focused and Input-focused methods.
Output-focused techniques encompass complex, multi-step generation strategies,
including reasoning (e.g., CoT, ToT, ReAct), various search and decoding
methods (e.g., MCTS, beam search), training for long CoT (e.g., RLVR, GRPO),
and model ensemble methods. Input-focused techniques are primarily categorized
by few-shot and RAG, with RAG as the central focus. The RAG section is further
detailed through a structured examination of query expansion, data, retrieval
and reranker, LLM generation methods, and multi-modal RAG.

### [309] [Toward Human-Centered Readability Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10801)
*Bahar İlgen,Georges Hattab*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出HCRS框架，超越传统NLP评估指标，整合自动测量与人类反馈，评估健康文本简化的人本可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NLP评估指标如BLEU、FKGL、SARI主要捕捉表面特征，无法评估清晰度、可信度、文化相关性等关键人本特质，这在高风险健康沟通中尤为重要。

Method: 提出HCRS五维评估框架，基于HCI和健康传播研究，整合自动测量与结构化人类反馈，捕捉可读性的关系和情境方面。

Result: 建立了包含清晰度、可信度、语气、文化相关性和可操作性五个维度的评估框架，并设计了参与式评估工作流程。

Conclusion: HCRS框架能够超越表面指标，使NLP系统更贴近用户需求、期望和生活经验，推动健康文本简化评估的发展。

Abstract: Text simplification is essential for making public health information
accessible to diverse populations, including those with limited health
literacy. However, commonly used evaluation metrics in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), such as BLEU, FKGL, and SARI, mainly capture surface-level
features and fail to account for human-centered qualities like clarity,
trustworthiness, tone, cultural relevance, and actionability. This limitation
is particularly critical in high-stakes health contexts, where communication
must be not only simple but also usable, respectful, and trustworthy. To
address this gap, we propose the Human-Centered Readability Score (HCRS), a
five-dimensional evaluation framework grounded in Human-Computer Interaction
(HCI) and health communication research. HCRS integrates automatic measures
with structured human feedback to capture the relational and contextual aspects
of readability. We outline the framework, discuss its integration into
participatory evaluation workflows, and present a protocol for empirical
validation. This work aims to advance the evaluation of health text
simplification beyond surface metrics, enabling NLP systems that align more
closely with diverse users' needs, expectations, and lived experiences.

### [310] [Is Implicit Knowledge Enough for LLMs? A RAG Approach for Tree-based Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10806)
*Mihir Gupte,Paolo Giusto,Ramesh S*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自下而上的方法，将树状结构（如GitHub仓库）的知识线性化，通过在每个层次生成隐式聚合摘要，用于RAG系统，相比原始代码检索减少了68%的文档数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何最好地表示检索到的知识，以在结构化数据（特别是树状层次结构）上生成响应，因为现有RAG方法在处理复杂层次结构时效果不佳。

Method: 采用自下而上的方法，对树状结构进行线性化，在每个层次级别生成隐式、聚合的摘要，然后将这些知识存储在知识库中直接用于RAG。

Result: 与使用原始非结构化代码的RAG相比，响应质量相当，但检索器中的文档数量减少了68%以上，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 利用隐式线性化知识可能是处理复杂层次数据结构的高效且可扩展策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are adept at generating responses based on
information within their context. While this ability is useful for interacting
with structured data like code files, another popular method,
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), retrieves relevant documents to augment
the model's in-context learning. However, it is not well-explored how to best
represent this retrieved knowledge for generating responses on structured data,
particularly hierarchical structures like trees. In this work, we propose a
novel bottom-up method to linearize knowledge from tree-like structures (like a
GitHub repository) by generating implicit, aggregated summaries at each
hierarchical level. This approach enables the knowledge to be stored in a
knowledge base and used directly with RAG. We then compare our method to using
RAG on raw, unstructured code, evaluating the accuracy and quality of the
generated responses. Our results show that while response quality is comparable
across both methods, our approach generates over 68% fewer documents in the
retriever, a significant gain in efficiency. This finding suggests that
leveraging implicit, linearized knowledge may be a highly effective and
scalable strategy for handling complex, hierarchical data structures.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了音译在跨语言NLP中的作用，发现罗马化在大多数评估设置中显著优于其他输入类型，主要原因是能共享更长的子词标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究共享脚本、重叠词汇和共享音素对多语言模型性能的贡献程度，探索音译作为连接不同语言的有效手段。

Method: 使用三种音译方法（罗马化、音素转录和替换密码）以及正字法进行对照实验，在命名实体识别和自然语言推理两个下游任务上评估模型性能。

Result: 罗马化在8个评估设置中的7个显著优于其他输入类型，与假设一致，表明这是最有效的方法。

Conclusion: 与预训练语言共享更长的子词标记能更好地利用模型，罗马化通过增加共享词汇量提升了多语言NLP性能。

Abstract: Transliteration has emerged as a promising means to bridge the gap between
various languages in multilingual NLP, showing promising results especially for
languages using non-Latin scripts. We investigate the degree to which shared
script, overlapping token vocabularies, and shared phonology contribute to
performance of multilingual models. To this end, we conduct controlled
experiments using three kinds of transliteration (romanization, phonemic
transcription, and substitution ciphers) as well as orthography. We evaluate
each model on two downstream tasks -- named entity recognition (NER) and
natural language inference (NLI) -- and find that romanization significantly
outperforms other input types in 7 out of 8 evaluation settings, largely
consistent with our hypothesis that it is the most effective approach. We
further analyze how each factor contributed to the success, and suggest that
having longer (subword) tokens shared with pre-trained languages leads to
better utilization of the model.

### [312] [DUAL-Bench: Measuring Over-Refusal and Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10846)
*Kaixuan Ren,Preslav Nakov,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DUAL-Bench，首个专注于视觉语言模型中过度拒绝和安全完成的多模态基准测试，评估了18个VLM在12个危险类别中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能系统解决视觉模态中的过度拒绝问题，模型在双重用途场景中经常失败，要么过于保守地拒绝，要么不安全地完成任务。

Method: 构建DUAL-Bench基准，评估18个VLM在12个危险类别下的表现，特别关注语义保持的视觉扰动下的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型表现有显著改进空间：GPT-5-Nano安全完成率为12.9%，GPT-5模型平均7.9%，Qwen模型仅3.9%。

Conclusion: DUAL-Bench将促进更精细的对齐策略发展，确保模型在复杂多模态环境中既安全又有用。

Abstract: As vision-language models become increasingly capable, maintaining a balance
between safety and usefulness remains a central challenge. Safety mechanisms,
while essential, can backfire, causing over-refusal, where models decline
benign requests out of excessive caution. Yet, no existing benchmark has
systematically addressed over-refusal in the visual modality. This setting
introduces unique challenges, such as dual-use cases where an instruction is
harmless, but the accompanying image contains harmful content. Models
frequently fail in such scenarios, either refusing too conservatively or
completing tasks unsafely, which highlights the need for more fine-grained
alignment. The ideal behavior is safe completion, i.e., fulfilling the benign
parts of a request while explicitly warning about any potentially harmful
elements. To address this, we present DUAL-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark focused on over-refusal and safe completion in VLMs. We evaluated 18
VLMs across 12 hazard categories, with focus on their robustness under
semantics-preserving visual perturbations. The results reveal substantial room
for improvement: GPT-5-Nano achieves 12.9% safe completion, GPT-5 models
average 7.9%, and Qwen models only 3.9%. We hope that DUAL-Bench will foster
the development of more nuanced alignment strategies that ensure models remain
both safe and useful in complex multimodal settings.

TL;DR: 本文评估了六种轻量级测试时扩展策略和四种LLM在Text-to-SQL任务上的表现，发现分治提示和少样本演示能有效提升性能，但额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管测试时扩展策略在LLM解决方案中显示出潜力，但其在现实应用中的有效性，特别是与最新推理模型结合时，仍不确定。

Method: 在BIRD Mini-Dev基准上评估六种轻量级、面向行业的测试时扩展策略和四种LLM（包括两个推理模型），除了标准准确率指标外，还报告推理延迟和token消耗。

Result: 分治提示和少样本演示能持续提升通用和推理型LLM的性能，但引入额外工作流程步骤效果不一，基础模型选择对结果影响显著。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了在部署Text2SQL系统时准确率、效率和复杂性之间的实际权衡关系。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly powering Text-to-SQL (Text2SQL)
systems, enabling non-expert users to query industrial databases using natural
language. While test-time scaling strategies have shown promise in LLM-based
solutions, their effectiveness in real-world applications, especially with the
latest reasoning models, remains uncertain. In this work, we benchmark six
lightweight, industry-oriented test-time scaling strategies and four LLMs,
including two reasoning models, evaluating their performance on the BIRD
Mini-Dev benchmark. Beyond standard accuracy metrics, we also report inference
latency and token consumption, providing insights relevant for practical system
deployment. Our findings reveal that Divide-and-Conquer prompting and few-shot
demonstrations consistently enhance performance for both general-purpose and
reasoning-focused LLMs. However, introducing additional workflow steps yields
mixed results, and base model selection plays a critical role. This work sheds
light on the practical trade-offs between accuracy, efficiency, and complexity
when deploying Text2SQL systems.

TL;DR: LLM x MapReduce-V3是一个分层模块化代理系统，用于生成长篇综述。它采用多智能体架构，将功能组件实现为独立的MCP服务器，通过高层规划器动态编排工作流程，支持人机交互干预。

Motivation: 基于先前工作LLM x MapReduce-V2，构建更灵活可控的综述生成系统，通过模块化分解实现人类干预和定制化研究过程。

Method: 采用分层模块化架构，功能组件（骨架初始化、摘要构建、骨架优化）作为独立MCP服务器实现，高层规划器根据MCP工具描述和执行历史动态选择模块，通过多轮交互精确捕捉研究视角。

Result: 人类评估显示系统在内容深度和长度方面均优于代表性基线方法，证明了基于MCP的模块化规划的优势。

Conclusion: LLM x MapReduce-V3通过分层模块化设计和MCP服务器架构，有效提升了长篇综述生成的质量和可控性，为研究过程提供了更好的定制化支持。

Abstract: We introduce LLM x MapReduce-V3, a hierarchically modular agent system
designed for long-form survey generation. Building on the prior work, LLM x
MapReduce-V2, this version incorporates a multi-agent architecture where
individual functional components, such as skeleton initialization, digest
construction, and skeleton refinement, are implemented as independent
model-context-protocol (MCP) servers. These atomic servers can be aggregated
into higher-level servers, creating a hierarchically structured system. A
high-level planner agent dynamically orchestrates the workflow by selecting
appropriate modules based on their MCP tool descriptions and the execution
history. This modular decomposition facilitates human-in-the-loop intervention,
affording users greater control and customization over the research process.
Through a multi-turn interaction, the system precisely captures the intended
research perspectives to generate a comprehensive skeleton, which is then
developed into an in-depth survey. Human evaluations demonstrate that our
system surpasses representative baselines in both content depth and length,
highlighting the strength of MCP-based modular planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM能够用自然语言表达置信度，但经常表现出过度自信，其原因尚不清楚。

Method: 提出ADVICE（答案依赖的置信度估计）微调框架，促进基于答案的置信度估计。

Result: ADVICE显著改善了置信度校准，同时保持了任务性能，增强了答案基础性，产生更平衡和良好校准的置信度分布。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了过度自信的根源，并建立了更可信的置信度表达框架。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has enabled them to express
their confidence in natural language, enhancing transparency and reliability.
However, their confidence often exhibits overconfidence, the cause of which
remains poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis of the
dynamics underlying verbalized confidence and identify answer-independence as a
key factor, defined as the model's failure to condition confidence on its own
answer. To address this, we propose ADVICE (Answer-Dependent Verbalized
Confidence Estimation), a fine-tuning framework that facilitates
answer-grounded confidence estimation. Extensive experiments show that ADVICE
substantially improves confidence calibration while preserving task
performance. Further analyses confirm that ADVICE strengthens
answer-groundedness, leading to more balanced and well-calibrated confidence
distributions. Our findings shed light on the origin of overconfidence and
establish a framework for more trustworthy confidence verbalization.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出GapDNER模型，通过将上下文间隙作为特殊span类型，使用token-pair网格标注解决不连续命名实体识别中的解码歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学领域中，命名实体可能由非相邻token组成且与其他实体重叠。现有方法通过连接实体片段或内部token来识别不连续实体，但由于span或单词组合的多样性而面临错误传播和解码歧义的挑战。

Method: 将上下文间隙作为额外span类型，将span分类转换为token-pair网格标注任务。设计两个交互组件：使用双仿射机制和线性注意力捕获每个span内部规律性的intra-span模块，以及使用交叉注意力获取不同span间语义关系的inter-span模块。在推理阶段使用BFS算法搜索有效路径。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验结果表明，GapDNER在不连续NER任务上达到了新的最先进性能，并在识别复杂实体结构方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: GapDNER通过创新性地对实体片段间的上下文间隙进行表示学习，有效解决了解码歧义问题，提升了不连续NER的性能。

Abstract: In biomedical fields, one named entity may consist of a series of
non-adjacent tokens and overlap with other entities. Previous methods recognize
discontinuous entities by connecting entity fragments or internal tokens, which
face challenges of error propagation and decoding ambiguity due to the wide
variety of span or word combinations. To address these issues, we deeply
explore discontinuous entity structures and propose an effective Gap-aware grid
tagging model for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition, named GapDNER. Our
GapDNER innovatively applies representation learning on the context gaps
between entity fragments to resolve decoding ambiguity and enhance
discontinuous NER performance. Specifically, we treat the context gap as an
additional type of span and convert span classification into a token-pair grid
tagging task. Subsequently, we design two interactive components to
comprehensively model token-pair grid features from both intra- and inter-span
perspectives. The intra-span regularity extraction module employs the biaffine
mechanism along with linear attention to capture the internal regularity of
each span, while the inter-span relation enhancement module utilizes
criss-cross attention to obtain semantic relations among different spans. At
the inference stage of entity decoding, we assign a directed edge to each
entity fragment and context gap, then use the BFS algorithm to search for all
valid paths from the head to tail of grids with entity tags. Experimental
results on three datasets demonstrate that our GapDNER achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on discontinuous NER and exhibits remarkable
advantages in recognizing complex entity structures.

TL;DR: 该论文提出评估AI系统对游戏评价能力的新范式，通过比较推理模型、语言模型与人类在游戏公平性和趣味性评价上的差异，发现推理模型更接近人类判断，但接近博弈论最优时与人类数据拟合度下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI评估主要关注问题解决能力，但缺乏对AI系统评价能力的评估。作者认为评估AI如何评估问题本身同样重要，特别是在游戏设计等需要主观判断的领域。

Method: 使用包含100多个新颖棋盘游戏和450多个人类判断的大规模数据集，比较现代语言模型、推理模型和符号计算代理在游戏公平性和趣味性评估上的表现。

Result: 推理模型在游戏评估上比非推理语言模型更接近人类判断，但随着模型接近博弈论最优，与人类数据的拟合度呈非单调下降。趣味性评估比公平性评估更不稳定，模型资源使用高度可变。

Conclusion: 需要在语言和推理模型中注入更多资源理性的元推理能力，以提高评估的稳定性和可预测性。

Abstract: Reasoning is not just about solving problems -- it is also about evaluating
which problems are worth solving at all. Evaluations of artificial intelligence
(AI) systems primarily focused on problem solving, historically by studying how
models play games such as chess and Go. In this paper, we advocate for a new
paradigm that assesses AI systems' evaluation of games. First, we introduce a
formalism for evaluating such evaluations. We then leverage a large-scale
dataset of over $100$ novel board games and over 450 human judgments to compare
evaluations produced by modern language and reasoning models against those of
people and symbolic computational agents. We consider two kinds of evaluative
queries: assessing the payoff (or fairness) and the funness of games. These
queries span two dimensions relevant to the design of evaluations of AI
evaluations: how complex a query is to compute and how difficult a query is to
quantify. Our results show that reasoning models are generally more aligned to
people in their evaluations of games than non-reasoning language models.
However, we observe a non-monotonic relationship: as models get closer to
game-theoretic optimal, their fit to human data weakens. We also observe more
"jaggedness" across models for assessing funness, in line with the greater
difficulty of quantifying this query. Across queries and games, reasoning
models show highly variable and unpredictable resource usage when assessing
queries, pointing to the importance of imbuing more resource-rational
meta-reasoning in language and reasoning models.

Conclusion: BiLSTM-CNN-CRF模型具有良好的可复现性，在命名实体识别和词性标注等序列标注任务中表现优异，开源实现有助于进一步研究。

Abstract: We present a reproducibility study of the state-of-the-art neural
architecture for sequence labeling proposed by Ma and Hovy
(2016)\cite{ma2016end}. The original BiLSTM-CNN-CRF model combines
character-level representations via Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs),
word-level context modeling through Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory
networks (BiLSTMs), and structured prediction using Conditional Random Fields
(CRFs). This end-to-end approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted features
while achieving excellent performance on named entity recognition (NER) and
part-of-speech (POS) tagging tasks. Our implementation successfully reproduces
the key results, achieving 91.18\% F1-score on CoNLL-2003 NER and demonstrating
the model's effectiveness across sequence labeling tasks. We provide a detailed
analysis of the architecture components and release an open-source PyTorch
implementation to facilitate further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的二值化流程在头部选择前会丢弃标点符号，这会改变成分结构并损害头部-子节点识别。

Method: 开发了可复现的预处理流程，在二值化前将标点符号保留为兄弟节点，并提供中间标记、可逆性签名和对齐索引等元数据。

Result: 在Penn Treebank上，标点感知预处理将头部预测准确率从73.66%（Collins规则）和86.66%（MLP）提升到91.85%，并在CCGbank推导上实现了有竞争力的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 发布的所有代码、配置文件和文档支持复现，并可扩展到其他语料库，证明了标点感知预处理在树库二值化中的重要性。

Abstract: This article presents a curated resource and evaluation suite for
punctuation-aware treebank binarization. Standard binarization pipelines drop
punctuation before head selection, which alters constituent shape and harms
head-child identification. We release (1) a reproducible pipeline that
preserves punctuation as sibling nodes prior to binarization, (2) derived
artifacts and metadata (intermediate @X markers, reversibility signatures,
alignment indices), and (3) an accompanying evaluation suite covering
head-child prediction, round-trip reversibility, and structural compatibility
with derivational resources (CCGbank). On the Penn Treebank, punctuation-aware
preprocessing improves head prediction accuracy from 73.66\% (Collins rules)

expansion of online communication. While numerous studies explored methods for
detecting and detoxifying such content, most have focused primarily on English,
leaving low-resource language underrepresented. Consequently, Large Language
Models~(LLMs) often struggle to identify and neutralize toxic expressions in
these languages. This challenge becomes even more pronounced when user employ
obfuscation techniques to evade detection systems. Therefore, we propose a
\textbf{KOTOX: Korean Toxic Dataset} for deobfuscation and detoxicification to
address this issue. We categorize various obfuscation approaches based on
linguistic characteristics of Korean and define a set of transformation rules
grounded in real-word examples. Using these rules, we construct three dataset
versions (easy, normal, and hard) representing different levels of obfuscation
difficulty. This is the first dataset that simultaneously supports
deobfuscation and detoxification for the Korean language. We expect it to
facilitate better understanding and mitigating of obfuscated toxic content in
LLM for low-resource languages. Our code and data are available at
https://github.com/leeyejin1231/KOTOX.

*Jidong Li,Lingyong Fang,Haodong Zhao,Sufeng Duan,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了JBA数据集和识别增强框架，用于评估和提升多模态大语言模型识别错误前提的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在错误前提识别方面存在范围有限、缺乏细粒度分类和覆盖不足的问题，无法充分评估模型识别错误前提的能力。

Method: 开发了全自动构建错误前提问题基准的流程，将前提系统分类为3个主要类型和13个子类型，并提出了专门增强模型识别错误前提鲁棒性的框架。

Result: 当前MLLMs在错误前提识别方面仍存在困难，但使用所提框架训练的模型在错误前提识别方面取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: JBA数据集为评估MLLMs识别错误前提能力提供了全面基准，所提增强框架有效提升了模型在此任务上的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have witnessed astonishing
advancements in recent years. Despite these successes, MLLMs remain vulnerable
to flase premise problems. However, existing benchmarks targeting this issue
are limited in scope: they often lack fine-grained categorization, exhibit
insufficient coverage, and thus fail to provide a rigorous evaluation of the
ability of models to recognize false premises. To bridge this gap, we introduce
a fully automated pipeline for constructing a comprehensive benchmark of false
premise questions. Our method systematically categorizes the premises into
three main types and thirteen subtypes according to the abilities required to
identify the premises, resulting in the JBA dataset.Results show current MLLMs
still struggle with false premise recognition. Building upon this benchmark, we
further propose a recognition enhancement framework tailored to strengthen the
robustness of MLLMs to detect false premises. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that models trained with our framework achieve significant improvements in
false premise recognition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RV-HATE框架，通过强化学习优化多个专门模块的权重，针对不同仇恨言论数据集的特征进行自适应检测，提高准确性并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨言论在不同平台和来源的数据集中表现出多样化特征，但现有检测方法通常采用固定方法，未能适应数据集特定特征。

Method: RV-HATE框架包含多个专门模块，每个模块关注仇恨言论的不同语言或上下文特征，使用强化学习优化模块权重，并通过投票机制聚合模块输出。

Result: 该方法有效处理隐含仇恨言论，相比传统静态方法获得更优性能。

Conclusion: RV-HATE通过自适应数据集特征的检测框架，提高了仇恨言论检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Hate speech remains prevalent in human society and continues to evolve in its
forms and expressions. Modern advancements in internet and online anonymity
accelerate its rapid spread and complicate its detection. However, hate speech
datasets exhibit diverse characteristics primarily because they are constructed
from different sources and platforms, each reflecting different linguistic
styles and social contexts. Despite this diversity, prior studies on hate
speech detection often rely on fixed methodologies without adapting to
data-specific features. We introduce RV-HATE, a detection framework designed to
account for the dataset-specific characteristics of each hate speech dataset.
RV-HATE consists of multiple specialized modules, where each module focuses on
distinct linguistic or contextual features of hate speech. The framework
employs reinforcement learning to optimize weights that determine the
contribution of each module for a given dataset. A voting mechanism then
aggregates the module outputs to produce the final decision. RV-HATE offers two
primary advantages: (1)~it improves detection accuracy by tailoring the
detection process to dataset-specific attributes, and (2)~it also provides
interpretable insights into the distinctive features of each dataset.
Consequently, our approach effectively addresses implicit hate speech and
achieves superior performance compared to conventional static methods. Our code
is available at https://github.com/leeyejin1231/RV-HATE.

*Zhiwen Ruan,Yixia Li,He Zhu,Yun Chen,Peng Li,Yang Liu,Guanhua Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CFT是一种高效的LLM微调方法，仅对关键推理标记进行梯度更新，在数学推理任务中优于标准SFT，同时保持输出多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督微调对所有标记进行均匀惩罚，忽略了只有少量关键标记决定推理正确性，导致输出多样性减少和泛化能力受限。

Method: 通过反事实扰动识别功能不可或缺的关键标记，仅对这些决定性推理步骤进行梯度更新，同时保留非关键标记的多样性。

Result: 在5个模型和11个数学推理基准测试中，CFT仅微调不到12%的标记，但始终优于标准SFT，并改善了采样多样性和强化学习初始化。

Conclusion: CFT是一个实用且通用的框架，可实现高效和稳健的LLM微调，在保持更高熵的同时维持性能增益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
as a key method to adapt pre-trained models to domain-specific tasks such as
mathematical reasoning. However, standard SFT uniformly penalizes all tokens,
neglecting that only a small subset of critical tokens determines reasoning
correctness. This uniform supervision often causes reduced output diversity and
limited generalization. We propose Critical Token Fine-tuning (CFT), a simple
yet effective approach that updates only tokens identified as functionally
indispensable via counterfactual perturbations. By focusing gradient signals on
these decisive reasoning steps while preserving the diversity of non-critical
tokens, CFT can enhance both generation and diversity. Extensive experiments on
five models across three families (Qwen, OLMo, LLaMA) and eleven mathematical
reasoning benchmarks show that CFT, despite fine-tuning on less than 12% of
tokens, consistently outperforms standard SFT. Moreover, CFT enables test-time
scaling through improved sampling diversity and provides a stronger
initialization for reinforcement learning, sustaining performance gains in
later training stages while maintaining higher entropy for better exploration.
These results highlight CFT as a practical and general framework for efficient
and robust LLM fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 提出了DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，通过四阶段安全保障和开放域评估来提升深度研究报告的质量和安全性，在防御成功率上提升18.16%，同时降低过度拒绝率6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度研究框架缺乏充分的评估程序和阶段特定保护，忽视了报告质量的关键方面如可信度、连贯性、广度、深度和安全性，可能导致危险或恶意源被整合到最终报告中。

Method: 引入DEEPRESEARCHGUARD框架，包含四阶段安全保障机制，使用开放域评估方法对参考文献和报告进行评估，并创建了DRSAFEBENCH阶段式安全基准。

Result: 在多种先进LLM上评估，DEEPRESEARCHGUARD平均防御成功率提升18.16%，过度拒绝率降低6%。输入防护提供最显著的早期保护，计划和研究防护增强了引用规范和源可信度。

Conclusion: DEEPRESEARCHGUARD能够实现全面的开放域评估和阶段感知防御，有效阻止有害内容传播，同时系统性地提高报告质量而不过度拒绝。

Abstract: Deep research frameworks have shown promising capabilities in synthesizing
comprehensive reports from web sources. While deep research possesses
significant potential to address complex issues through planning and research
cycles, existing frameworks are deficient in sufficient evaluation procedures
and stage-specific protections. They typically treat evaluation as exact match
accuracy of question-answering, but overlook crucial aspects of report quality
such as credibility, coherence, breadth, depth, and safety. This oversight may
result in hazardous or malicious sources being integrated into the final
report. To address these issues, we introduce DEEPRESEARCHGUARD, a
comprehensive framework featuring four-stage safeguards with open-domain
evaluation of references and reports. We assess performance across multiple
metrics, e.g., defense success rate and over-refusal rate, and five key report
dimensions. In the absence of a suitable safety benchmark, we introduce
DRSAFEBENCH, a stage-wise benchmark for deep research safety. Our evaluation
spans diverse state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-flash,
DeepSeek-v3, and o4-mini. DEEPRESEARCHGUARD achieves an average defense success
rate improvement of 18.16% while reducing over-refusal rate by 6%. The input
guard provides the most substantial early-stage protection by filtering out
obvious risks, while the plan and research guards enhance citation discipline
and source credibility. Through extensive experiments, we show that
DEEPRESEARCHGUARD enables comprehensive open-domain evaluation and stage-aware
defenses that effectively block harmful content propagation, while
systematically improving report quality without excessive over-refusal rates.

TL;DR: 该研究对6个大型语言模型在2820个招聘场景中进行审计，发现模型对残障人士存在显著歧视，特别是当残障与性别、种姓等身份交叉时，现有安全工具难以检测这些交叉性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注西方语境下的身份歧视，忽视了全球南方地区残障人士面临的性别、种姓等多重边缘化问题，需要开发能够捕捉交叉性偏见的评估方法。

Method: 引入ABLEIST评估框架，包含5个残障歧视指标和3个交叉性伤害指标，基于残疾研究文献，对6个LLM在2820个招聘场景中进行全面审计。

Result: 发现模型对残障候选人存在显著的ABLEIST伤害，许多先进模型未能检测到这些偏见。性别和种姓边缘化的残障候选人面临更严重的交叉性伤害。

Conclusion: 当前安全工具存在关键盲点，需要在高风险领域（如招聘）对前沿模型进行交叉性安全评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly under scrutiny for perpetuating
identity-based discrimination in high-stakes domains such as hiring,
particularly against people with disabilities (PwD). However, existing research
remains largely Western-centric, overlooking how intersecting forms of
marginalization--such as gender and caste--shape experiences of PwD in the
Global South. We conduct a comprehensive audit of six LLMs across 2,820 hiring
scenarios spanning diverse disability, gender, nationality, and caste profiles.
To capture subtle intersectional harms and biases, we introduce ABLEIST
(Ableism, Inspiration, Superhumanization, and Tokenism), a set of five
ableism-specific and three intersectional harm metrics grounded in disability
studies literature. Our results reveal significant increases in ABLEIST harms
towards disabled candidates--harms that many state-of-the-art models failed to
detect. These harms were further amplified by sharp increases in intersectional
harms (e.g., Tokenism) for gender and caste-marginalized disabled candidates,
highlighting critical blind spots in current safety tools and the need for
intersectional safety evaluations of frontier models in high-stakes domains
like hiring.

*Tieyuan Chen,Xiaodong Chen,Haoxing Chen,Zhenzhong Lan,Weiyao Lin,Jianguo Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Nested Depth (DND)方法，通过动态选择关键token进行嵌套深度处理，提升现成LLM性能，同时最小化计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决LLM在处理困难token时的性能瓶颈，同时避免对简单token的冗余计算，需要一种动态选择机制来精确控制token的重新处理。

Method: 在transformer层结束时，使用路由器识别关键token，将其反馈进行额外处理。采用路由器控制损失和阈值控制方案来确保选择稳定性和区分度。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，密集模型Qwen3-1.7B性能提升1.88%，MoE模型Qwen3-30B-A3B性能提升0.87%，参数和计算开销增加极小。

Conclusion: DND方法能有效提升预训练模型的性能，通过动态选择关键token进行嵌套处理，在最小化额外开销的同时实现显著性能提升。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Nested Depth (DND), a novel method that improves
performance for off-the-shelf LLMs by selecting critical tokens to reprocess in
a nested depth manner. Specifically, at the end of the given transformer layer,
DND identifies more critical tokens with a router and feeds them back for an
extra round of processing, effectively ``reviewing" difficult tokens while
avoiding redundant computation for easier ones. The dynamic selection mechanism
is tailored for precise control via two novel strategies: a router controlling
loss to enhance token selection distinguishability, and a threshold control
scheme to ensure selection stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DND
by directly integrating it into pre-trained dense and MoE models during a
post-training phase. On diverse benchmarks, this approach boosts the
performances of the dense Qwen3-1.7B by 1.88% and the MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B by
0.87%, all with a minimal parameter and computing increase.

Motivation: 现有的逻辑-数值推理数据集依赖固定规则集，任务复杂度控制有限，限制了其在评估和训练中的通用性。

Method: 开发LogiNumSynth合成器，支持对推理世界丰富度、逻辑推理深度和数值计算复杂度的细粒度控制，实现跨难度级别的灵活数据合成。

Result: 实验显示多个LLM在逻辑-数值推理方面存在持续弱点，LogiNumSynth可作为诊断工具和针对性监督来源。

Conclusion: LogiNumSynth能够作为诊断工具和针对性监督来源，提升语言模型的集成推理能力。

Abstract: Joint logical-numerical reasoning remains a major challenge for language
models, yet existing datasets rely on fixed rule sets and offer limited control
over task complexity, constraining their generalizability for evaluation and
training. We present LogiNumSynth, a flexible natural language problem
synthesizer that synthesizes tasks requiring proficiency in joint logical
reasoning (e.g., rule-based reasoning) and numerical reasoning (e.g.,
arithmetic computation). LogiNumSynth supports fine-grained control over
reasoning world richness, logical reasoning depth, and the complexity of
numerical computations, enabling flexible data synthesis across difficulty
levels. We demonstrate three key contributions: (1) Synthesizer -- synthesizing
fully controllable joint reasoning tasks over natural language; (2) Evaluation
& Process Analysis -- evaluating both process accuracy and answer accuracy; (3)
Targeted Training -- using synthesized data to enhance LLMs' reasoning
performance. Experiments with multiple LLMs highlight persistent weaknesses in
logical-numerical reasoning, showing that LogiNumSynth can serve as both a
diagnostic tool and a source of targeted supervision for advancing integrated
reasoning skills.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的直接部署存在安全风险，因为其领域专业知识有限。为了降低风险，需要将LLM重新定位为与医生协作的临床助手，而非直接面向患者。

Method: 通过两阶段灵感反馈调查确定临床工作流程中的真实需求，构建了包含92,000个问答实例的DoctorFLAN中文医疗数据集，涵盖22个临床任务和27个专科。引入了DoctorFLAN-test和DotaBench进行模型评估。

Conclusion: 这项工作为推进以医生为中心的医疗LLM开发提供了有价值的资源和框架，通过将LLM定位为临床助手来确保医疗应用的安全性。

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has transformed healthcare by
offering clinical guidance, yet their direct deployment to patients poses
safety risks due to limited domain expertise. To mitigate this, we propose
repositioning LLMs as clinical assistants that collaborate with experienced
physicians rather than interacting with patients directly. We conduct a
two-stage inspiration-feedback survey to identify real-world needs in clinical
workflows. Guided by this, we construct DoctorFLAN, a large-scale Chinese
medical dataset comprising 92,000 Q&A instances across 22 clinical tasks and 27
specialties. To evaluate model performance in doctor-facing applications, we
introduce DoctorFLAN-test (550 single-turn Q&A items) and DotaBench (74
multi-turn conversations). Experimental results with over ten popular LLMs
demonstrate that DoctorFLAN notably improves the performance of open-source
LLMs in medical contexts, facilitating their alignment with physician workflows
and complementing existing patient-oriented models. This work contributes a
valuable resource and framework for advancing doctor-centered medical LLM
development

TL;DR: LRD是一个两阶段并行序列生成框架，通过潜在精炼和预测反馈循环解决现有扩散方法的信息丢失和过早承诺问题，在保持准确性的同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型存在高延迟问题，而现有扩散方法存在信息丢失（非最终化token的预测分布被丢弃）和过早承诺（局部决策缺乏全局协调）两个核心限制。

Method: 提出潜在精炼解码（LRD）框架：第一阶段将掩码位置保持为预测token和掩码嵌入的分布混合，建立全局一致的信念；第二阶段逐步确定置信token，保留不确定token进行迭代反馈，使用KL散度动态作为收敛和早停准则。

Result: 在编程（HumanEval +6.3，MBPP +2.6）和推理（GSM8K +2.9，MATH500 +3.8）任务上准确率提升，同时实现高达10.6倍的加速。

Conclusion: LRD是并行序列生成的一个强大且通用的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著提升速度。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models remain the standard for natural language
generation but still suffer from high latency due to strictly sequential
decoding. Recent diffusion-inspired approaches, such as LlaDA and Dream,
mitigate this by generating in parallel, yet they suffer from two core
limitations: information loss, as predictive distributions for non-finalized
tokens are discarded at each step, and premature commitment, where local
decisions are made without sufficient global coordination. We introduce Latent
Refinement Decoding (LRD), a two-stage framework with Latent Refinement and a
Predictive Feedback Loop. The first stage maintains masked positions as
distributional mixtures of predicted tokens and the mask embedding, allowing
the model to establish more globally consistent beliefs. The second stage
progressively finalizes confident tokens while retaining uncertain ones for
iterative feedback. KL-divergence dynamics provide a principled and reliable
criterion for convergence and early stopping. Experiments across coding
(HumanEval +6.3, MBPP +2.6) and reasoning (GSM8K +2.9, MATH500 +3.8) show that
LRD improves accuracy while delivering speedups of up to 10.6x, making it a
strong and versatile alternative for parallel sequence generation.

TL;DR: CGPO是一种基于置信度信号的推理路径偏好优化方法，通过在模型推理过程中识别最大不确定性点，应用自生成的非人类式推理路径指导来减轻轨迹漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化LLM推理的方法倾向于引入对人类式推理轨迹的训练偏差，依赖人类或更高能力模型的中间步骤注释限制了探索替代性、非人类式推理路径，从而约束了可实现的性能。

Method: 提出置信度引导的推理路径偏好优化(CGPO)，利用置信度信号识别模型推理过程中的最大不确定性点，并应用自生成的非人类式推理路径指导。

Result: 实验涵盖应用于代码和数学推理任务的各种模型，结果表明在相同训练数据量下，使用小模型生成数据的方法在大多数情况下比使用强模型生成数据或人工标注的方法表现更好。

Conclusion: 在模型最低置信度点提供指导比定位第一个显式错误提供更准确的监督，CGPO方法能够有效提升模型推理性能。

Abstract: Current approaches for strengthening LLM reasoning tend to introduce a
training bias toward human-like reasoning trajectories. In step-wise preference
optimization, in particular, dependence on human or higher-capacity model
annotations for intermediate steps limits exploration of alternative,
non-human-like reasoning paths and thus constrains achievable performance.
Furthermore, through a small-scale pilot study, we observed that in
approximately 75% of cases, the model's first erroneous step occurs after the
lowest-confidence point. This suggests that guiding the model at its
lowest-confidence point before an error provides more accurate supervision than
locating the first explicit error. In this paper, we propose Confidence-Guided
Reasoning Path Preference Optimization (CGPO), a method that leverages a
confidence signal to identify points of maximal uncertainty in the model's
reasoning process and applies self-generated, non-human-like reasoning-path
guidance to mitigate trajectory drift. Our experiments span diverse models
applied to both code and mathematical reasoning tasks. The results show that,
with the same amount of training data, our method using data generated by a
small model can achieve better performance in most cases compared with
approaches using data generated by a strong model or human-annotated.

Motivation: LLM在代码生成方面表现出色，但其输出常包含细微但关键的安全漏洞，在安全敏感系统中存在显著风险。

Method: 使用强类型可验证语言（以Scala为例），结合Stainless框架进行形式验证和通用安全代码生成，采用类型导向的代理流程。

Abstract: Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code
generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs
often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks
when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper
introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security
and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and
verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the
effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the
Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments
with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often
fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure
code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input
validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential
of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the
trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.

Motivation: 基于距离的无监督文本分类具有快速推理和适应扩展标签集的优势，但多标签分类中阈值确定是一个未充分探索的挑战。现有方法使用统一阈值，无法处理不同标签的语义相似性差异。

Method: 通过探索性研究验证文本和标签间语义关系在不同模型、数据集和标签集中的变化，提出使用验证集优化标签特定阈值的方法。

Conclusion: 标签特定阈值优化是提升基于距离的无监督多标签文本分类性能的有效方法，能够显著改善分类效果，特别是在处理不同语义相似性分布的标签时。

Abstract: Distance-based unsupervised text classification is a method within text
classification that leverages the semantic similarity between a label and a
text to determine label relevance. This method provides numerous benefits,
including fast inference and adaptability to expanding label sets, as opposed
to zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned neural networks that require re-training
in such cases. In multi-label distance-based classification and information
retrieval algorithms, thresholds are required to determine whether a text
instance is "similar" to a label or query. Similarity between a text and label
is determined in a dense embedding space, usually generated by state-of-the-art
sentence encoders. Multi-label classification complicates matters, as a text
instance can have multiple true labels, unlike in multi-class or binary
classification, where each instance is assigned only one label. We expand upon
previous literature on this underexplored topic by thoroughly examining and
evaluating the ability of sentence encoders to perform distance-based
classification. First, we perform an exploratory study to verify whether the
semantic relationships between texts and labels vary across models, datasets,
and label sets by conducting experiments on a diverse collection of realistic
multi-label text classification (MLTC) datasets. We find that similarity
distributions show statistically significant differences across models,
datasets and even label sets. We propose a novel method for optimizing
label-specific thresholds using a validation set. Our label-specific
thresholding method achieves an average improvement of 46% over normalized 0.5
thresholding and outperforms uniform thresholding approaches from previous work
by an average of 14%. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong performance
even with limited labeled examples.

Motivation: 仇恨言论对社会和个人构成严重威胁，但现有研究主要关注英语，低资源语言缺乏资源和基准。许多低资源语言存在多种语言变体，这一因素在当前方法中常被忽视。

Method: 通过系统分析和整合现有资源，构建了标准化的欧洲西班牙语仇恨言论数据集元集合，并将其翻译成欧洲葡萄牙语和两种加利西亚语变体，创建对齐的多语言语料库。评估了大语言模型在零样本、少样本和微调设置下的性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多语言和变体感知方法在仇恨言论检测中的重要性，为代表性不足的欧洲语言提供了改进基准的基础。

Abstract: Hate speech poses a serious threat to social cohesion and individual
well-being, particularly on social media, where it spreads rapidly. While
research on hate speech detection has progressed, it remains largely focused on
English, resulting in limited resources and benchmarks for low-resource
languages. Moreover, many of these languages have multiple linguistic
varieties, a factor often overlooked in current approaches. At the same time,
large language models require substantial amounts of data to perform reliably,
a requirement that low-resource languages often cannot meet. In this work, we
address these gaps by compiling a meta-collection of hate speech datasets for
European Spanish, standardised with unified labels and metadata. This
collection is based on a systematic analysis and integration of existing
resources, aiming to bridge the data gap and support more consistent and
scalable hate speech detection. We extended this collection by translating it
into European Portuguese and into a Galician standard that is more convergent
with Spanish and another Galician variant that is more convergent with
Portuguese, creating aligned multilingual corpora. Using these resources, we
establish new benchmarks for hate speech detection in Iberian languages. We
evaluate state-of-the-art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and
fine-tuning settings, providing baseline results for future research. Moreover,

*Johannes Moll,Markus Graf,Tristan Lemke,Nicolas Lenhart,Daniel Truhn,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Jiazhen Pan,Daniel Rueckert,Lisa C. Adams,Keno K. Bressem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个临床基础的框架来评估视觉语言模型在胸部X光视觉问答中的思维链忠实性，发现答案准确性与解释质量脱节，专有模型在归因和保真度方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的思维链解释往往听起来合理但不能反映实际决策过程，这在临床高风险应用中会破坏信任，现有评估方法很少能发现这种不一致。

Method: 通过控制文本和图像修改在三个维度上探测思维链忠实性：临床保真度、因果归因和置信度校准，进行了读者研究（n=4）并基准测试了六个视觉语言模型。

Result: 评估者-放射科医生相关性在所有维度上都落在观察到的放射科医生间范围内，归因对齐强，保真度对齐中等，置信度对齐弱；专有模型在归因（25.0% vs. 1.4%）和保真度（36.1% vs. 31.7%）方面得分更高。

Conclusion: 答案准确性和解释质量是脱节的，文本提示比视觉提示更能改变解释，需要超越最终答案准确性来评估模型，特别是在高风险临床部署中。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often produce chain-of-thought (CoT)
explanations that sound plausible yet fail to reflect the underlying decision
process, undermining trust in high-stakes clinical use. Existing evaluations
rarely catch this misalignment, prioritizing answer accuracy or adherence to
formats. We present a clinically grounded framework for chest X-ray visual
question answering (VQA) that probes CoT faithfulness via controlled text and
image modifications across three axes: clinical fidelity, causal attribution,
and confidence calibration. In a reader study (n=4), evaluator-radiologist
correlations fall within the observed inter-radiologist range for all axes,
with strong alignment for attribution (Kendall's $\tau_b=0.670$), moderate
alignment for fidelity ($\tau_b=0.387$), and weak alignment for confidence tone
($\tau_b=0.091$), which we report with caution. Benchmarking six VLMs shows
that answer accuracy and explanation quality are decoupled, acknowledging
injected cues does not ensure grounding, and text cues shift explanations more
than visual cues. While some open-source models match final answer accuracy,
proprietary models score higher on attribution (25.0% vs. 1.4%) and often on
fidelity (36.1% vs. 31.7%), highlighting deployment risks and the need to
evaluate beyond final answer accuracy.

*Yisong Miao,Min-Yen Kan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文发现Transformer语言模型中存在稀疏的"话语电路"（约0.2%的GPT-2模型参数），这些电路负责处理话语关系理解，并在不同话语框架中具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformer语言模型中哪些组件负责话语理解，假设存在稀疏的计算图（话语电路）控制模型处理话语关系的过程。

Method: 引入CuDR任务（在指定话语关系下完成话语），构建最小对比对语料库用于激活修补电路发现，实验使用GPT-2模型。

Result: 稀疏电路（约0.2%参数）在英语PDTB-based CuDR任务中恢复话语理解能力，这些电路能泛化到RST和SDRT等未见话语框架。低层捕获词汇语义和共指等语言特征，高层编码话语级抽象。

Conclusion: Transformer语言模型中存在专门处理话语关系的稀疏电路，这些电路在不同话语框架中具有一致的泛化能力，且特征效用在不同框架中保持一致。

Abstract: Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse
understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as
discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike
simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning.
To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under
Discourse Relation (CuDR), where a model completes a discourse given a
specified relation. To support this task, we construct a corpus of minimal
contrastive pairs tailored for activation patching in circuit discovery.
Experiments show that sparse circuits ($\approx 0.2\%$ of a full GPT-2 model)
recover discourse understanding in the English PDTB-based CuDR task. These
circuits generalize well to unseen discourse frameworks such as RST and SDRT.
Further analysis shows lower layers capture linguistic features such as lexical
semantics and coreference, while upper layers encode discourse-level
abstractions. Feature utility is consistent across frameworks (e.g.,
coreference supports Expansion-like relations).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RAGen框架，用于为领域特定的RAG系统生成问题-答案-上下文三元组训练数据，支持多种RAG适配策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统需要领域特定的训练数据，而通用问答数据不足以支持有效的领域适配。

Method: 通过识别文档关键概念、基于Bloom分类学生成多样化问题、从相关上下文中提取精确答案来生成QAC三元组，支持模块化处理流程。

Result: 开发了可扩展的框架，能够高效处理大规模动态文档语料库，无需冗余处理。

Conclusion: RAGen为动态演进领域（如科学研究和企业知识库）的RAG系统适配提供了有效的训练数据生成解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines the language understanding and
reasoning power of large language models (LLMs) with external retrieval to
enable domain-grounded responses. Effectively adapting RAG systems to
domain-specific settings requires specialized, context-rich training data
beyond general-purpose question-answering. Here, we propose RAGen, a scalable
and modular framework for generating domain-grounded question-answer-context
(QAC) triples tailored to diverse RAG adaptation approaches. RAGen produces
these QAC triples by identifying key concepts in documents, generating diverse
questions guided by Bloom's Taxonomy-inspired principles, and pairing them with
precise answers extracted from relevant contexts. RAGen supports multiple RAG
adaptation strategies, including the optimization of key components such as the
LLM, retriever, and embedding model, etc. Its modular pipeline features
semantic chunking, hierarchical concept extraction, and multi-chunk retrieval,
along with the introduction of curated distractor contexts to promote robust
reasoning. Designed for scalability, RAGen efficiently handles large and
evolving document corpora without redundant processing, making it especially
suitable for dynamic evolving domains such as scientific research and
enterprise knowledge bases.

*Saad Obaid ul Islam,Anne Lauscher,Goran Glavaš*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLAQ框架揭示LLMs在简单和复杂查询中对同一事实的回答存在系统性不一致，挑战了当前评估实践假设简单事实问答性能好即意味着复杂任务可靠的观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在简单事实问答中表现出色，但在复杂查询中回答同一事实时出现不一致，这种可靠性差距削弱了模型的可信度。

Method: 提出SLAQ评估框架，比较LLMs对同一事实问题在孤立形式（短查询）和集成到复杂查询中（长查询）的回答一致性，测试了16个LLM在600个查询上的表现。

Result: 发现短长查询回答存在系统性不一致，存在位置依赖的准确性损失和动量效应，机制分析显示对齐事实激活重叠模型内部，机制相似性指标可预测短长回答对齐达78%准确率。

Conclusion: 事实一致性是LLMs可信度的重要方面，当前评估实践需要重新考虑，不能假设简单事实问答性能好就意味着复杂知识寻求任务可靠。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can correctly answer "When was Einstein born?"
yet fail to provide the same date when writing about Einstein's life revealing
a fundamental inconsistency in how models access factual knowledge across task
complexities. While models display impressive accuracy on factual
question-answering benchmarks, the reliability gap between simple and complex
queries remains poorly understood, eroding their trustworthiness. In this work,
we introduce Short-Long Form Alignment for Factual Question Answering (SLAQ), a
controlled evaluation framework that compares LLMs' answers to the same factual
questions asked (a) in isolation (short) vs. (b) integrated into complex
queries (long). Looking at 16 LLMs across 600 queries, we find a systematic
misalignment of answers to the corresponding short and long queries. We further
uncover position-dependent accuracy loss and momentum effects where consecutive
correct or incorrect answers create self-reinforcing patterns. Through
mechanistic analysis, we find that aligned facts activate overlapping model
internals, and that metrics based on mechanistic similarity can predict
short-long answer alignment with up to 78% accuracy. Our work establishes
factual consistency over query complexity as an important aspect of LLMs'
trustworthiness and challenges current evaluation practices, which implicitly
assume that good performance for simple factual queries implies reliability in
more complex knowledge-seeking tasks too.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebRouter是一个基于信息论的查询特定路由器，通过成本感知变分信息瓶颈目标，在压缩输入提示的同时惩罚预期操作成本，显著降低了LLM大脑网络代理的操作成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM大脑网络代理在Web自动化中面临关键的成本-性能权衡问题，复杂的提示包含目标、行动历史和状态信息，导致LLM集成性能下降。

Method: 提出WebRouter，采用成本感知变分信息瓶颈(ca-VIB)目标，学习输入提示的压缩表示，同时明确惩罚预期操作成本。

Result: 在WebVoyager基准的五个真实网站上的实验显示，WebRouter相比GPT-4o基线降低了87.8%的操作成本，仅带来3.8%的准确率下降。

Conclusion: WebRouter通过信息论方法有效解决了网络代理的成本-性能权衡问题，在显著降低成本的同时保持了较高的性能水平。

Abstract: LLM-brained web agents offer powerful capabilities for web automation but
face a critical cost-performance trade-off. The challenge is amplified by web
agents' inherently complex prompts that include goals, action histories, and
environmental states, leading to degraded LLM ensemble performance. To address
this, we introduce WebRouter, a novel query-specific router trained from an
information-theoretic perspective. Our core contribution is a cost-aware
Variational Information Bottleneck (ca-VIB) objective, which learns a
compressed representation of the input prompt while explicitly penalizing the
expected operational cost. Experiments on five real-world websites from the
WebVoyager benchmark show that WebRouter reduces operational costs by a
striking 87.8\% compared to a GPT-4o baseline, while incurring only a 3.8\%
accuracy drop.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出道德公平一致性(MFC)指标，用于评估道德情感分类模型在跨域场景下的公平性稳定性，发现Twitter到Reddit的迁移性能下降显著，且整体性能指标会掩盖公平性违规问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中的道德情感分类在跨域迁移时面临公平性挑战，整体性能指标可能掩盖特定标签的公平性违规问题，需要开发专门的诊断性指标。

Method: 使用MFTC和MFRC数据集，在BERT和DistilBERT模型上进行多标签分类实验，采用域内和跨域协议，提出MFC指标量化道德基础检测的跨域稳定性。

Result: 发现Twitter到Reddit迁移导致micro-F1下降14.9%，而反向迁移仅下降1.5%；authority标签存在严重的公平性违规(DPD=0.22-0.23, EOD=0.40-0.41)；MFC与DPD完美负相关(rho=-1.000)，loyalty标签一致性最高(MFC=0.96)，authority最低(MFC=0.78)。

Conclusion: MFC作为补充性诊断指标，能够有效评估道德推理模型在异构语言环境中的公平性稳定性，为模型可靠部署提供支持。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness in natural language processing for moral sentiment
classification is challenging, particularly under cross-domain shifts where
transformer models are increasingly deployed. Using the Moral Foundations
Twitter Corpus (MFTC) and Moral Foundations Reddit Corpus (MFRC), this work
evaluates BERT and DistilBERT in a multi-label setting with in-domain and
cross-domain protocols. Aggregate performance can mask disparities: we observe
pronounced asymmetry in transfer, with Twitter->Reddit degrading micro-F1 by
14.9% versus only 1.5% for Reddit->Twitter. Per-label analysis reveals fairness
violations hidden by overall scores; notably, the authority label exhibits
Demographic Parity Differences of 0.22-0.23 and Equalized Odds Differences of
0.40-0.41. To address this gap, we introduce the Moral Fairness Consistency
(MFC) metric, which quantifies the cross-domain stability of moral foundation
detection. MFC shows strong empirical validity, achieving a perfect negative
correlation with Demographic Parity Difference (rho = -1.000, p < 0.001) while
remaining independent of standard performance metrics. Across labels, loyalty
demonstrates the highest consistency (MFC = 0.96) and authority the lowest (MFC
= 0.78). These findings establish MFC as a complementary, diagnosis-oriented
metric for fairness-aware evaluation of moral reasoning models, enabling more
reliable deployment across heterogeneous linguistic contexts. .

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文重新评估语义解析器评估方法，将图匹配与自动定理证明相结合，发现基于图匹配的评估指标（如Smatch）不能准确反映逻辑等价性，并提出逻辑敏感评估和简化标准化目标表示的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图匹配的语义解析器评估指标（如Smatch）主要捕捉表面重叠而非逻辑等价，这限制了在推理导向应用中的有效性。

Method: 比较监督微调（T5-Small/Base）和少样本上下文学习（GPT-4o/4.1/5）两种解析器构建方法，使用图匹配、双向蕴含证明和良构性三种评估方式，分析标准化和非标准化目标的影响。

Result: 在图匹配上表现良好的模型往往无法产生逻辑等价的公式。标准化减少了目标变异性，提高了良构性和逻辑充分性。错误分析显示性能随公式复杂度增加而下降，主要失败涉及变量绑定、索引和谓词命名。

Conclusion: 图基评估指标在推理导向应用中存在局限性，需要逻辑敏感的评估和训练目标，以及简化、标准化的目标表示。

Abstract: Graph-matching metrics such as Smatch are the de facto standard for
evaluating neural semantic parsers, yet they capture surface overlap rather
than logical equivalence. We reassess evaluation by pairing graph-matching with
automated theorem proving. We compare two approaches to building parsers:
supervised fine-tuning (T5-Small/Base) and few-shot in-context learning
(GPT-4o/4.1/5), under normalized and unnormalized targets. We evaluate outputs
using graph-matching, bidirectional entailment between source and target
formulas with a first-order logic theorem prover, and well-formedness. Across
settings, we find that models performing well on graph-matching often fail to
produce logically equivalent formulas. Normalization reduces incidental target
variability, improves well-formedness, and strengthens logical adequacy. Error
analysis shows performance degrades with increasing formula complexity and with
coordination, prepositional phrases, and passive voice; the dominant failures
involve variable binding and indexing, and predicate naming. These findings
highlight limits of graph-based metrics for reasoning-oriented applications and
motivate logic-sensitive evaluation and training objectives together with
simplified, normalized target representations. All code and data for our
experiments are publicly available.

Motivation: 抑郁症是全球公共卫生问题，但公开的中文抑郁症检测资源稀缺且大多限于二元分类，需要更丰富的资源来支持中文人群的心理健康应用。

Method: 构建包含44,178条中文社交媒体文本的数据集，由心理学专家标注10,306个抑郁相关片段，提供二元风险标签和结构化多维心理属性。

Result: 实验结果表明该数据集在多种NLP任务中具有实用性，包括结构化心理分析和大型语言模型微调，能有效识别抑郁症风险并进行心理分析。

Conclusion: CNSocialDepress数据集为中文人群的心理健康应用提供了有价值的资源，支持可解释和细粒度的抑郁信号分析。

Abstract: Depression is a pressing global public health issue, yet publicly available
Chinese-language resources for risk detection remain scarce and are mostly
limited to binary classification. To address this limitation, we release
CNSocialDepress, a benchmark dataset for depression risk detection from Chinese
social media posts. The dataset contains 44,178 texts from 233 users, within
which psychological experts annotated 10,306 depression-related segments.
CNSocialDepress provides binary risk labels together with structured
multi-dimensional psychological attributes, enabling interpretable and
fine-grained analysis of depressive signals. Experimental results demonstrate
its utility across a wide range of NLP tasks, including structured
psychological profiling and fine-tuning of large language models for depression
detection. Comprehensive evaluations highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
practical value for depression risk identification and psychological analysis,
thereby providing insights to mental health applications tailored for

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XQuant是一个无需训练、即插即用的KV缓存量化框架，通过数据无关校准和跨层压缩实现亚1.4位超低比特量化，在保持模型精度的同时显著减少内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长文本处理时KV缓存内存需求巨大，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署。量化是减少内存消耗的有效方法，但现有方法在超低比特量化方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出XQuant框架，包含两个关键创新：计算量可忽略的数据无关校准方法和跨层KV缓存压缩技术，实现亚1.4位量化。

Result: 在TruthfulQA和LongBench上的实验表明，XQuant优于KIVI-2bit和AsymKV-1.5bit等先进方法，在更低比特宽度下保持更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: XQuant在内存效率和模型精度之间建立了更好的平衡，为资源受限环境中的大语言模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse natural language processing tasks. However, their extensive memory
requirements, particularly due to KV cache growth during long-text
understanding and generation, present significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained environments. Quantization has emerged as a promising
solution to reduce memory consumption while preserving historical information.
We propose XQuant, a training-free and plug-and-play framework that achieves
ultra-low equivalent bit-width KV cache quantization. XQuant introduces two key
innovations: a computationally negligible data-free calibration method and
cross-layer KV cache compression, enabling quantization to sub-1.4 bits.
Extensive experiments on TruthfulQA and LongBench demonstrate that XQuant
outperforms state-of-the-art methods (e.g., KIVI-2bit and AsymKV-1.5bit) by
achieving lower bit-width while maintaining superior performance, establishing
a better trade-off between memory efficiency and model accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的AI代理攻击方式——内容攻击，即通过提供有偏见、误导性或虚假信息来操纵AI代理行为，而非传统的指令注入攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御机制主要关注检测隐藏指令，但对基于内容操纵的攻击无效。AI代理需要能够批判性评估检索信息，以保护自身和用户免受内容攻击。

Method: 将自然语言处理中的自动事实核查任务重新定位为AI代理的认知自我防御工具，通过外部证据验证主张并评估来源可信度。

Result: 论文论证了内容攻击的有效性，并提出了基于自动事实核查的防御框架。

Conclusion: AI代理需要集成事实核查能力来防御内容攻击，这是确保其安全可靠运行的关键措施。

Abstract: When AI agents retrieve and reason over external documents, adversaries can
manipulate the data they receive to subvert their behaviour. Previous research
has studied indirect prompt injection, where the attacker injects malicious
instructions. We argue that injection of instructions is not necessary to
manipulate agents - attackers could instead supply biased, misleading, or false
information. We term this an attack by content. Existing defenses, which focus
on detecting hidden commands, are ineffective against attacks by content. To
defend themselves and their users, agents must critically evaluate retrieved
information, corroborating claims with external evidence and evaluating source
trustworthiness. We argue that this is analogous to an existing NLP task,
automated fact-checking, which we propose to repurpose as a cognitive
self-defense tool for agents.

TL;DR: 研究发现，为人类设计的心理测量测试直接应用于大语言模型时，在可靠性方面表现中等，但在生态效度方面存在严重问题，测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不一致甚至负相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着心理测量测试越来越多地用于评估大语言模型的心理构念，需要系统评估这些原本为人类设计的测试在应用于LLMs时是否具有意义。

Method: 系统评估了三种构念（性别歧视、种族歧视和道德）的人类心理测量测试的可靠性和效度，包括收敛效度（理论基础的测试间相关性）和生态效度（测试分数与下游任务行为的对齐）。

Result: 测试在多个项目和提示变体中表现出中等可靠性，但心理测量测试分数与模型在下游任务中的行为不匹配，在某些情况下甚至呈负相关，表明生态效度较低。

Conclusion: 在解释心理测量测试分数之前，必须进行系统评估，为人类设计的测试不能直接应用于大语言模型而无需调整。

Abstract: Psychometric tests are increasingly used to assess psychological constructs
in large language models (LLMs). However, it remains unclear whether these
tests -- originally developed for humans -- yield meaningful results when
applied to LLMs. In this study, we systematically evaluate the reliability and
validity of human psychometric tests for three constructs: sexism, racism, and
morality. We find moderate reliability across multiple item and prompt
variations. Validity is evaluated through both convergent (i.e., testing
theory-based inter-test correlations) and ecological approaches (i.e., testing
the alignment between tests scores and behavior in real-world downstream
tasks). Crucially, we find that psychometric test scores do not align, and in
some cases even negatively correlate with, model behavior in downstream tasks,
indicating low ecological validity. Our results highlight that systematic
evaluations of psychometric tests is essential before interpreting their
scores. They also suggest that psychometric tests designed for humans cannot be
applied directly to LLMs without adaptation.

TL;DR: 提出EASE框架用于实时假新闻检测，通过证据评估、推理评估和情感回退三个视角动态适应决策过程，在证据稀缺时仍能有效检测假新闻。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时场景中新兴事件缺乏足够支持证据时假新闻检测的挑战，现有方法过度依赖外部证据，在证据稀缺时泛化能力不足。

Method: EASE框架包含三个独立评估视角：证据评估（仅在证据充分时使用）、推理评估（仅在LLM可靠性足够时使用）、情感回退（当前两者不可靠时使用），通过指令调优和伪标签提升评估准确性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著提升对实时新闻的泛化能力，并发布了RealTimeNews-25新基准数据集。

Conclusion: EASE通过动态评估机制有效解决了证据稀缺下的假新闻检测问题，在实时场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Fake news detection becomes particularly challenging in real-time scenarios,
where emerging events often lack sufficient supporting evidence. Existing
approaches often rely heavily on external evidence and therefore struggle to
generalize under evidence scarcity. To address this issue, we propose
Evaluation-Aware Selection of Experts (EASE), a novel framework for real-time
fake news detection that dynamically adapts its decision-making process
according to the assessed sufficiency of available evidence. EASE introduces a
sequential evaluation mechanism comprising three independent perspectives: (1)
Evidence-based evaluation, which assesses evidence and incorporates it into
decision-making only when the evidence is sufficiently supportive; (2)
Reasoning-based evaluation, which leverages the world knowledge of large
language models (LLMs) and applies them only when their reliability is
adequately established; and (3) Sentiment-based fallback, which integrates
sentiment cues when neither evidence nor reasoning is reliable. To enhance the
accuracy of evaluation processes, EASE employs instruction tuning with pseudo
labels to guide each evaluator in justifying its perspective-specific knowledge
through interpretable reasoning. Furthermore, the expert modules integrate the
evaluators' justified assessments with the news content to enable
evaluation-aware decision-making, thereby enhancing overall detection accuracy.
Moreover, we introduce RealTimeNews-25, a new benchmark comprising recent news
for evaluating model generalization on emerging news with limited evidence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EASE not only achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmarks, but also significantly improves
generalization to real-time news. The code and dataset are available:

TL;DR: 研究发现，在上下文学习中也会出现突发性错位现象，即通过少量窄范围示例就能使前沿模型产生广泛错位的回答，错位率可达58%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明窄范围微调会导致模型广泛错位，但这种现象在上下文学习中是否出现尚不清楚。

Method: 使用三个数据集和三个前沿模型，通过提供64-256个窄范围上下文示例，并分析逐步推理过程。

Result: 模型在64个示例下错位率为2%-17%，256个示例下可达58%。67.5%的错位推理轨迹显示模型采用危险"角色"来合理化有害输出。

Conclusion: 上下文学习确实会产生突发性错位，其机制与微调诱导的错位相似，模型会采纳危险角色来合理化有害行为。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned
LLMs, a phenomenon termed emergent misalignment (EM). While concerning, these
findings were limited to finetuning and activation steering, leaving out
in-context learning (ICL). We therefore ask: does EM emerge in ICL? We find
that it does: across three datasets, three frontier models produce broadly
misaligned responses at rates between 2% and 17% given 64 narrow in-context
examples, and up to 58% with 256 examples. We also examine mechanisms of EM by
eliciting step-by-step reasoning (while leaving in-context examples unchanged).
Manual analysis of the resulting chain-of-thought shows that 67.5% of
misaligned traces explicitly rationalize harmful outputs by adopting a reckless
or dangerous ''persona'', echoing prior results on finetuning-induced EM.

Conclusion: 识别了未来工作的关键挑战，发布了儿童心理健康领域的KG数据集，以促进高风险领域更透明可靠的应用

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) are vital for knowledge-intensive tasks and have shown
promise in reducing hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). However,
constructing high-quality KGs remains difficult, requiring accurate information
extraction and structured representations that support interpretability and
downstream utility. Existing LLM-based approaches often focus narrowly on
entity and relation extraction, limiting coverage to sentence-level contexts or
relying on predefined schemas. We propose a hierarchical extraction framework
that organizes information at multiple levels, enabling the creation of
semantically rich and well-structured KGs. Using state-of-the-art LLMs, we
extract and construct knowledge graphs and evaluate them comprehensively from
both structural and semantic perspectives. Our results highlight the strengths
and shortcomings of current LLMs in KG construction and identify key challenges

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于专家演示的模仿学习方法只能学习最优行为，无法处理次优演示中的错误和低效问题，而强化学习虽然能探索但数据效率低。

Method: 将语言反馈嵌入作为Transformer策略输入序列的一部分，并可选地添加反馈预测的辅助自监督学习目标，结合传统的下一动作预测目标。

Result: 在BabyAI-XGen环境中的视觉语言任务上，该方法显著提升了组合泛化能力和鲁棒性，能够将次优行为转化为学习机会。

Conclusion: 语言反馈是语言指定具身任务中中间标量奖励的竞争性且直观的替代方案，数据效率高。

Abstract: Current approaches to embodied AI tend to learn policies from expert
demonstrations. However, without a mechanism to evaluate the quality of
demonstrated actions, they are limited to learning from optimal behaviour, or
they risk replicating errors and inefficiencies. While reinforcement learning
offers one alternative, the associated exploration typically results in
sacrificing data efficiency. This work explores how agents trained with
imitation learning can learn robust representations from both optimal and
suboptimal demonstrations when given access to constructive language feedback
as a means to contextualise different modes of behaviour. We directly provide
language feedback embeddings as part of the input sequence into a
Transformer-based policy, and optionally complement the traditional next action
prediction objective with auxiliary self-supervised learning objectives for
feedback prediction. We test our approach on a range of embodied
Vision-and-Language tasks in our custom BabyAI-XGen environment and show
significant improvements in agents' compositional generalisation abilities and
robustness, suggesting that our data-efficient method allows models to
successfully convert suboptimal behaviour into learning opportunities. Overall,
our results suggest that language feedback is a competitive and intuitive
alternative to intermediate scalar rewards for language-specified embodied
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个结构化视觉语言模型提示框架，用于从简化文本生成可访问图像，通过五种提示模板和专家评估验证了基础对象聚焦模板在语义对齐方面的最佳效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智力障碍人士理解复杂文本的困难，现有文本到图像模型注重美观而非可访问性，需要探索视觉插图与文本简化之间的关系。

Method: 设计了五种提示模板（基础对象聚焦、上下文场景、教育布局、多级细节、网格布局），使用400个句子级简化文本，进行两阶段评估：CLIPScore评估和四位可访问性专家的人工标注。

Result: 基础对象聚焦提示模板实现了最高的语义对齐，复古风格被评为最可访问，维基百科是最有效的数据源，文本简单性维度显示出强可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架为可访问内容生成提供了实用指南，强调了结构化提示在AI生成视觉可访问性工具中的重要性，视觉极简主义增强了语言可访问性。

Abstract: Individuals with intellectual disabilities often have difficulties in
comprehending complex texts. While many text-to-image models prioritize
aesthetics over accessibility, it is not clear how visual illustrations relate
to text simplifications (TS) generated from them. This paper presents a
structured vision-language model (VLM) prompting framework for generating
accessible images from simplified texts. We designed five prompt templates,
i.e., Basic Object Focus, Contextual Scene, Educational Layout, Multi-Level
Detail, and Grid Layout, each following distinct spatial arrangements while
adhering to accessibility constraints such as object count limits, spatial
separation, and content restrictions. Using 400 sentence-level simplifications
from four established TS datasets (OneStopEnglish, SimPA, Wikipedia, and
ASSET), we conducted a two-phase evaluation: Phase 1 assessed prompt template
effectiveness with CLIPScores, and Phase 2 involved human annotation of
generated images across ten visual styles by four accessibility experts.
Results show that the Basic Object Focus prompt template achieved the highest
semantic alignment, indicating that visual minimalism enhances language
accessibility. Expert evaluation further identified Retro style as the most
accessible and Wikipedia as the most effective data source. Inter-annotator
agreement varied across dimensions, with Text Simplicity showing strong
reliability and Image Quality proving more subjective. Overall, our framework
offers practical guidelines for accessible content generation and underscores
the importance of structured prompting in AI-generated visual accessibility
tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对LLMs情感智能需求的增长，需要理解情感表达的内部机制并控制生成文本中的情感。

Method: 构建SEV数据集，提取上下文无关情感方向，通过分解分析和因果分析识别情感计算组件，构建全局情感电路并进行调控。

Result: 发现了跨上下文一致的情感编码机制，验证了神经元和注意力头的因果作用，通过调控情感电路实现了99.65%的情感表达准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统揭示和验证LLMs中情感电路的研究，为可解释性和可控情感智能提供了新见解。

Abstract: As the demand for emotional intelligence in large language models (LLMs)
grows, a key challenge lies in understanding the internal mechanisms that give
rise to emotional expression and in controlling emotions in generated text.
This study addresses three core questions: (1) Do LLMs contain context-agnostic
mechanisms shaping emotional expression? (2) What form do these mechanisms
take? (3) Can they be harnessed for universal emotion control? We first
construct a controlled dataset, SEV (Scenario-Event with Valence), to elicit
comparable internal states across emotions. Subsequently, we extract
context-agnostic emotion directions that reveal consistent, cross-context
encoding of emotion (Q1). We identify neurons and attention heads that locally
implement emotional computation through analytical decomposition and causal
analysis, and validate their causal roles via ablation and enhancement
interventions. Next, we quantify each sublayer's causal influence on the
model's final emotion representation and integrate the identified local
components into coherent global emotion circuits that drive emotional
expression (Q2). Directly modulating these circuits achieves 99.65%
emotion-expression accuracy on the test set, surpassing prompting- and
steering-based methods (Q3). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
study to uncover and validate emotion circuits in LLMs, offering new insights
into interpretability and controllable emotional intelligence.

*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出并系统研究了LLM特定效用的概念，发现人类标注的段落对LLMs并非最优，且真实效用段落在不同LLMs间不可转移，强调了在RAG研究中采用LLM特定效用的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索关注相关性，但RAG的有效性取决于检索段落的效用，即促进生成准确全面答案的有用性。现有研究将效用视为通用属性，忽略了不同LLMs因内部知识和理解能力差异可能从相同段落中获益不同。

Method: 通过跨多个数据集和LLMs的大规模实验，研究LLM特定效用。提出基于困惑度的LLM特定效用评估基准程序，评估现有效用判断方法在六个数据集上的表现。

Result: 实验表明人类标注的段落对特定LLMs并非最优效用段落，真实效用段落在不同LLMs间不可转移。使用伪答案的言语化方法表现稳健，但LLMs在评估效用方面存在困难——无法拒绝已知查询的所有段落，也无法为未知查询选择真正有用的段落。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在RAG研究中采用LLM特定效用的必要性，并揭示了LLMs在效用评估方面的局限性，为改进RAG系统的效用判断提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. While traditional retrieval focuses on
relevance, RAG's effectiveness depends on the utility of retrieved passages,
i.e., the usefulness in facilitating the generation of an accurate and
comprehensive answer. Existing studies often treat utility as a generic
attribute, ignoring the fact that different LLMs may benefit differently from
the same passage due to variations in internal knowledge and comprehension
ability. In this work, we introduce and systematically investigate the notion
of LLM-specific utility. Through large-scale experiments across multiple
datasets and LLMs, we demonstrate that human-annotated passages are not optimal
for LLMs and that ground-truth utilitarian passages are not transferable across
different LLMs. These findings highlight the necessity of adopting the
LLM-specific utility in RAG research. Our findings indicate that some
human-annotated passages are not ground-truth utilitarian passages for specific
LLMs, partially due to the varying readability of queries and passages for
LLMs, a tendency for which perplexity is a key metric. Based on these findings,
we propose a benchmarking procedure for LLM-specific utility judgments. We
evaluate existing utility judgment methods on six datasets and find that while
verbalized methods using pseudo-answers perform robustly, LLMs struggle to
assess utility effectively-failing to reject all passages for known queries and
to select truly useful ones for unknown queries.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Rollout Routing Replay (R3)方法来解决MoE模型中路由机制在强化学习训练中的不稳定性问题，通过记录推理阶段的路由分布并在训练中重放，显著降低了训练-推理策略KL散度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型中的路由机制在强化学习训练中会引入不稳定性，甚至导致灾难性训练崩溃。研究发现训练和推理阶段存在显著的路由行为差异，即使在相同条件下，路由框架也会产生不同的专家选择。

Method: 提出R3方法：记录推理引擎中的路由分布，并在训练阶段重放这些分布。这种方法显著减少了训练-推理策略的KL散度，缓解了极端差异，同时不影响训练速度。

Result: 在各种设置下的广泛实验证实，R3成功稳定了RL训练，防止了崩溃，并且在性能上超过了GSPO和TIS等方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为稳定MoE模型中的强化学习训练提供了一个新的解决方案，通过解决训练-推理一致性这一基础问题来提升模型稳定性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a crucial approach for enhancing
the capabilities of large language models. However, in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
models, the routing mechanism often introduces instability, even leading to
catastrophic RL training collapse. We analyze the training-inference
consistency of MoE models and identify a notable discrepancy in routing
behaviors between the two phases. Moreover, even under identical conditions,
the routing framework can yield divergent expert selections across repeated
forward passes. To address this foundational inconsistency, we propose Rollout
Routing Replay (R3), a method that records routing distributions from the
inference engine and replays them during training. R3 significantly reduces
training-inference policy KL divergence and mitigates extreme discrepancies
without compromising training speed. Extensive experiments on various settings
confirm that R3 succeeds in stabilizing RL training, preventing collapse and
outperforming methods such as GSPO and TIS. We believe this work can offer a
new solution for stabilizing RL in MoE models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在微调过程中的记忆问题，发现记忆现象在训练早期急剧增加，并提出基于n-gram记忆分数的早期停止策略和损失正则化方法来有效缓解记忆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会记忆训练数据，从而暴露私有或受版权保护的文本。现有防御方法主要针对预训练阶段，而对微调过程中的记忆问题，特别是领域适应和指令微调中的记忆机制了解不足。

Method: 在Pythia、Llama3和Mistral模型（1.4B-70B参数）上进行微调实验，跟踪逐字记忆情况。使用n-gram记忆分数作为早期停止标准，并引入n-gram感知的损失正则化器。

Result: 记忆在训练前几个epoch中急剧增加，通常远早于验证困惑度或评估性能达到最优。提出的n-gram记忆分数能可靠地预测逐字记忆，作为早期停止标准可显著减少记忆且性能损失最小。n-gram感知损失正则化器在所有测试模型家族中减少记忆达40%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型微调过程中的记忆动态，提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案来缓解记忆问题，同时最小化性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models excel across many tasks, they can memorise
training data and thereby expose private or copyrighted text. Most defences
target the pre-training stage, leaving memorisation during fine-tuning,
especially for domain adaptation and instruction tuning, poorly understood. We
fine-tune Pythia, Llama3, and Mistral models spanning 1.4B-70B parameters on
common evaluation datasets and track verbatim memorisation throughout training.
We find that memorisation increases dramatically in the first few epochs, often
significantly before either validation perplexity or evaluation performance is
optimised. We use a simple but effective n-gram memorisation score which
reliably precedes verbatim memorisation; using it as an early-stopping
criterion mitigates memorisation with minimal performance loss. Further, we
introduce an n-gram-aware loss regulariser and show that it reduces
memorisation across all model families tested by up to 40% while minimising
evaluation performance trade-offs when compared to an existing memorisation
mitigation strategy. These results yield practical, scalable insights into
memorisation dynamics during language model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将狼人杀游戏简化为LLM自博弈，产生模板化对话且缺乏质量参考数据，无法捕捉社交游戏的丰富性。

Method: 构建包含100+小时视频、3240万词元的多模态数据集，提出两阶段策略对齐评估：言语评估（多选择任务）和决策评估（投票选择与角色推断）。

Result: 实验显示最先进LLM表现多样，约半数模型得分低于0.50，在欺骗和反事实推理方面存在明显差距。

Conclusion: 该数据集和评估框架为多智能体交互中的语言、推理和策略研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Social deduction games like Werewolf combine language, reasoning, and
strategy, providing a testbed for studying natural language and social
intelligence. However, most studies reduce the game to LLM-based self-play,
yielding templated utterances and anecdotal cases that overlook the richness of
social gameplay. Evaluation further relies on coarse metrics such as survival
time or subjective scoring due to the lack of quality reference data. To
address these gaps, we curate a high-quality, human-verified multimodal
Werewolf dataset containing over 100 hours of video, 32.4M utterance tokens,
and 15 rule variants. Based on this dataset, we propose a novel
strategy-alignment evaluation that leverages the winning faction's strategies
as ground truth in two stages: 1) Speech evaluation, formulated as
multiple-choice-style tasks that assess whether the model can adopt appropriate
stances across five dimensions of social ability; and 2) Decision evaluation,
which assesses the model's voting choices and opponent-role inferences. This
framework enables a fine-grained evaluation of models' linguistic and reasoning
capabilities, while capturing their ability to generate strategically coherent
gameplay. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art LLMs show diverse
performance, with roughly half remain below 0.50, revealing clear gaps in
deception and counterfactual reasoning. We hope our dataset further inspires
research on language, reasoning, and strategy in multi-agent interaction.

TL;DR: KnowRL是一个简单但强大的框架，通过自省和共识奖励机制增强LLM对自身能力边界的认知，无需外部监督即可提升模型的自知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的LLM在超过五分之一的情况下会错误判断自身能力，导致基于这种内部不确定性的响应无法完全信任。需要开发能够增强模型自知能力的可靠AI系统。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：(1)自省：模型生成并分类其判断为可行或不可行的任务；(2)共识奖励：通过内部一致性来强化自我认知评估的稳定性。使用内部生成数据，避免昂贵的外部监督。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上的实验显示，KnowRL稳步提升了自我认知能力，准确率提升高达28%，F1分数提升12%，仅需少量种子集和几轮迭代即可超越基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架解锁了LLM自我提升知识意识的潜力，为构建更可靠、更负责任的AI以及在关键应用中更安全部署打开了大门。由于其简单性和不依赖外部资源的特点，建议将此可靠性增强过程应用于所有未来模型。

Abstract: Truly reliable AI requires more than simply scaling up knowledge; it demands
the ability to know what it knows and when it does not. Yet recent research
shows that even the best LLMs misjudge their own competence in more than one in
five cases, making any response born of such internal uncertainty impossible to
fully trust. Inspired by self-improvement reinforcement learning techniques
that require minimal data, we present a simple but powerful framework KnowRL
that strengthens a model's internal understanding of its own feasibility
boundaries, enabling safer and more responsible behaviour. Our framework
combines two components: (i) introspection, where the model generates and
classifies tasks it judges feasible or infeasible, and (ii) consensus-based
rewarding, where stability of self-knowledge assessment is reinforced through
internal agreement. By using internally generated data, this design strengthens
consistency in self-knowledge and entirely avoids costly external supervision.
In experiments on LLaMA-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-7B, KnowRL steadily improved
self-knowledge, validated by both intrinsic self-consistency and extrinsic
benchmarking. With nothing more than a small seed set and no external
supervision, our method drove gains as high as 28% in accuracy and 12% in F1,
outperforming baselines in just a few iterations. Our framework essentially
unlocks the untapped capacity of LLMs to self-improve their knowledge
awareness, opening the door to reliable, more accountable AI and safer
deployment in critical applications. Owing to its simplicity and independence
from external effort, we encourage applying this reliability-enhancing process
to all future models.

Motivation: 调查成本高且执行缓慢，LLMs被提议作为可扩展的低成本替代方案，但其输出存在偏差，需要研究如何有效结合合成与去偏方法。

Method: 研究合成方法（使用LLM生成调查响应）与校正方法（去偏人口估计）的相互作用，探索人类响应在两者间的最佳分配策略。

Result: 单独使用合成方法引入显著偏差（24-86%），结合校正方法可将偏差降至5%以下，有效样本量提升达14%。

Conclusion: 在固定预算下，将大部分人类响应分配给校正方法比传统全用于微调能实现更有效的估计。

Abstract: Surveys provide valuable insights into public opinion and behavior, but their
execution is costly and slow. Large language models (LLMs) have been proposed
as a scalable, low-cost substitute for human respondents, but their outputs are
often biased and yield invalid estimates. We study the interplay between
synthesis methods that use LLMs to generate survey responses and rectification
methods that debias population estimates, and explore how human responses are
best allocated between them. Using two panel surveys with questions on
nutrition, politics, and economics, we find that synthesis alone introduces
substantial bias (24-86%), whereas combining it with rectification reduces bias
below 5% and increases effective sample size by up to 14%. Overall, we
challenge the common practice of using all human responses for fine-tuning,
showing that under a fixed budget, allocating most to rectification results in
far more effective estimation.

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) have become central to everyday life,
producing human-like text across diverse domains. A growing body of research
investigates whether these models also exhibit personality- and
demographic-like characteristics in their language. In this work, we introduce
a novel, data-driven methodology for assessing LLM personality without relying
on self-report questionnaires, applying instead automatic personality and
gender classifiers to model replies on open-ended questions collected from
Reddit. Comparing six widely used models to human-authored responses, we find
that LLMs systematically express higher Agreeableness and lower Neuroticism,
reflecting cooperative and stable conversational tendencies. Gendered language
patterns in model text broadly resemble those of human writers, though with
reduced variation, echoing prior findings on automated agents. We contribute a
new dataset of human and model responses, along with large-scale comparative
analyses, shedding new light on the topic of personality and demographic
patterns of generative AI.

Conclusion: GenCNER是一个简单有效的生成式框架，能够有效缓解持续命名实体识别中的灾难性遗忘和语义偏移问题。

Abstract: Traditional named entity recognition (NER) aims to identify text mentions
into pre-defined entity types. Continual Named Entity Recognition (CNER) is
introduced since entity categories are continuously increasing in various
real-world scenarios. However, existing continual learning (CL) methods for NER
face challenges of catastrophic forgetting and semantic shift of non-entity
type. In this paper, we propose GenCNER, a simple but effective Generative
framework for CNER to mitigate the above drawbacks. Specifically, we skillfully
convert the CNER task into sustained entity triplet sequence generation problem
and utilize a powerful pre-trained seq2seq model to solve it. Additionally, we
design a type-specific confidence-based pseudo labeling strategy along with
knowledge distillation (KD) to preserve learned knowledge and alleviate the
impact of label noise at the triplet level. Experimental results on two
benchmark datasets show that our framework outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods in multiple CNER settings, and achieves the smallest
gap compared with non-CL results.

Abstract: Text preprocessing is a fundamental component of Natural Language Processing,
involving techniques such as stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization to
prepare text as input for further processing and analysis. Despite the
context-dependent nature of the above techniques, traditional methods usually
ignore contextual information. In this paper, we investigate the idea of using
Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform various preprocessing tasks, due to
their ability to take context into account without requiring extensive
language-specific annotated resources. Through a comprehensive evaluation on
web-sourced data, we compare LLM-based preprocessing (specifically stopword
removal, lemmatization and stemming) to traditional algorithms across multiple
text classification tasks in six European languages. Our analysis indicates
that LLMs are capable of replicating traditional stopword removal,
lemmatization, and stemming methods with accuracies reaching 97%, 82%, and 74%,
respectively. Additionally, we show that ML algorithms trained on texts
preprocessed by LLMs achieve an improvement of up to 6% with respect to the
$F_1$ measure compared to traditional techniques. Our code, prompts, and

Motivation: 现有LLM幻觉检测方法存在"检测困境"：内部状态探测方法擅长检测事实不一致但无法识别逻辑谬误，而思维链验证方法则相反，这造成了任务依赖的盲点。

Method: 引入多路径推理机制获取更可比较的细粒度信号，以及分段感知时序交叉注意力模块来自适应融合对齐后的表示，从而精确定位细微的不一致。

Conclusion: 成功解决了LLM幻觉检测中的关键挑战，提供了一个统一的检测框架，能够有效识别事实不一致和逻辑谬误两种类型的幻觉。

Abstract: The detection of sophisticated hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs)
is hampered by a ``Detection Dilemma'': methods probing internal states
(Internal State Probing) excel at identifying factual inconsistencies but fail
on logical fallacies, while those verifying externalized reasoning
(Chain-of-Thought Verification) show the opposite behavior. This schism creates
a task-dependent blind spot: Chain-of-Thought Verification fails on
fact-intensive tasks like open-domain QA where reasoning is ungrounded, while
Internal State Probing is ineffective on logic-intensive tasks like
mathematical reasoning where models are confidently wrong. We resolve this with
a unified framework that bridges this critical gap. However, unification is
hindered by two fundamental challenges: the Signal Scarcity Barrier, as coarse
symbolic reasoning chains lack signals directly comparable to fine-grained
internal states, and the Representational Alignment Barrier, a deep-seated
mismatch between their underlying semantic spaces. To overcome these, we
introduce a multi-path reasoning mechanism to obtain more comparable,
fine-grained signals, and a segment-aware temporalized cross-attention module
to adaptively fuse these now-aligned representations, pinpointing subtle
dissonances. Extensive experiments on three diverse benchmarks and two leading
LLMs demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms
strong baselines. Our code is available: https://github.com/peach918/HalluDet.

Result: 在三个越南语基准数据集（PhoNER-COVID19、PhoDisfluency、VietMed-NER）上实验结果表明，该方法持续优于包括仅Transformer和混合神经网络模型在内的强基线

Conclusion: 结合预训练语义特征和图关系建模能有效提升跨多个领域的token分类性能

Abstract: We propose a novel neural architecture named TextGraphFuseGAT, which
integrates a pretrained transformer encoder (PhoBERT) with Graph Attention
Networks for token-level classification tasks. The proposed model constructs a
fully connected graph over the token embeddings produced by PhoBERT, enabling
the GAT layer to capture rich inter-token dependencies beyond those modeled by
sequential context alone. To further enhance contextualization, a
Transformer-style self-attention layer is applied on top of the graph-enhanced
embeddings. The final token representations are passed through a classification
head to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our approach on three Vietnamese
benchmark datasets: PhoNER-COVID19 for named entity recognition in the COVID-19
domain, PhoDisfluency for speech disfluency detection, and VietMed-NER for
medical-domain NER. VietMed-NER is the first Vietnamese medical spoken NER
dataset, featuring 18 entity types collected from real-world medical speech
transcripts and annotated with the BIO tagging scheme. Its specialized
vocabulary and domain-specific expressions make it a challenging benchmark for
token-level classification models. Experimental results show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines, including transformer-only and
hybrid neural models such as BiLSTM + CNN + CRF, confirming the effectiveness
of combining pretrained semantic features with graph-based relational modeling
for improved token classification across multiple domains.

*Jiayu Ding,Lei Cui,Li Dong,Nanning Zheng,Furu Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PART方法，通过移除自我对话行为和重新排序子结论来保护推理轨迹不被非法蒸馏，同时保持人类可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的详细推理轨迹虽然有助于用户理解验证，但也容易被非法蒸馏。现有保护策略往往过度简化推理过程，剥夺了用户的中间信息。

Method: 设计两步重构方法：移除自我对话行为，重新排序子结论。训练小型辅助模型执行重构，计算开销极小。

Result: PART在各种推理基准测试中一致地破坏蒸馏效果。例如，32B学生模型在AIME 2024上的性能从54.17降至46.88，下降13.5%。

Conclusion: PART方法有效平衡了信息保护与人类可读性，为推理轨迹保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) show that extending the
length of reasoning chains significantly improves performance on complex tasks.
While revealing these reasoning traces helps users better follow, verify, and
learn from the model's problem-solving process, it also makes them highly
vulnerable to unauthorized distillation. To mitigate this risk, proprietary
model providers often adopt aggressive protection strategies, such as replacing
detailed reasoning with brief summaries, which deprive users of valuable
intermediate information. To address this trade-off, we propose PART, an
information-preserving antidistillation reformulation of reasoning traces.
Motivated by the difference between how humans understand reasoning traces and
how LLMs exploit them for supervised fine-tuning, we design a simple but
effective two-step reformulation: removing self-talk behaviors and reordering
sub-conclusions. A small auxiliary model is trained to perform this
reformulation, incurring minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PART consistently disrupts distillation across student models
of different sizes and types on various reasoning benchmarks. For instance,
when training on reformulated traces, even the performance of a large 32B
student model decreases from 54.17 to 46.88 on AIME 2024, corresponding to a
13.5% degradation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个连接语言活力、数字存在与后殖民理论的框架，揭示了AI系统中语言不平等不是偶然而是结构性的，识别出四种语言类别，并指出英语在AI中的主导地位是权力结构的产物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在大量多语言语料上训练，但全球约2000种有数百万使用者的语言在数字生态系统中几乎不可见，这反映了深刻的语言不平等危机。

Method: 通过分析所有有记录的人类语言数据，将语言按活力（现实世界人口强度）和数字性（在线存在）分为四类：强权语言、数字回声、消逝声音和隐形巨人。

Result: 识别出27%的语言属于"隐形巨人"类别，这些语言有数百万使用者但几乎零数字存在，反映了从殖民时代语言等级到当代AI发展的连续性。

Conclusion: 英语在AI中的主导地位不是技术必然，而是系统性排斥边缘化语言知识的权力结构产物，需要去殖民化语言技术并民主化AI利益获取。

Abstract: Large Language Models are trained on massive multilingual corpora, yet this
abundance masks a profound crisis: of the world's 7,613 living languages,
approximately 2,000 languages with millions of speakers remain effectively
invisible in digital ecosystems. We propose a critical framework connecting
empirical measurements of language vitality (real world demographic strength)
and digitality (online presence) with postcolonial theory and epistemic
injustice to explain why linguistic inequality in AI systems is not incidental
but structural. Analyzing data across all documented human languages, we
identify four categories: Strongholds (33%, high vitality and digitality),
Digital Echoes (6%, high digitality despite declining vitality), Fading Voices
(36%, low on both dimensions), and critically, Invisible Giants (27%, high
vitality but near-zero digitality) - languages spoken by millions yet absent
from the LLM universe. We demonstrate that these patterns reflect continuities
from colonial-era linguistic hierarchies to contemporary AI development,
constituting what we term digital epistemic injustice. Our analysis reveals
that English dominance in AI is not a technical necessity but an artifact of
power structures that systematically exclude marginalized linguistic knowledge.
We conclude with implications for decolonizing language technology and
democratizing access to AI benefits.

Method: 基于社会文化理论构建框架，形式化语言风格如何受情境、关系和文化背景影响；构建基于该框架的基准数据集，由多元文化评分者标注；提出跨文化评估的新要求：对话框架、风格敏感性和主观正确性

Result: 评估显示当今顶级LLM在对话环境中的文化适应方面表现不佳

Conclusion: 需要更符合实际对话场景的文化适应评估方法，当前LLM在多文化对话中的文化适应能力有限

Abstract: Existing benchmarks that measure cultural adaptation in LLMs are misaligned
with the actual challenges these models face when interacting with users from
diverse cultural backgrounds. In this work, we introduce the first framework
and benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multicultural
conversational settings. Grounded in sociocultural theory, our framework
formalizes how linguistic style - a key element of cultural communication - is
shaped by situational, relational, and cultural context. We construct a
benchmark dataset based on this framework, annotated by culturally diverse
raters, and propose a new set of desiderata for cross-cultural evaluation in
NLP: conversational framing, stylistic sensitivity, and subjective correctness.
We evaluate today's top LLMs on our benchmark and show that these models
struggle with cultural adaptation in a conversational setting.

Conclusion: LLMAtKGE框架能有效进行对抗攻击并生成解释，通过消融和案例研究验证了其解释生成能力

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) aim to disrupt the
model's ability of link prediction by removing or inserting triples. A recent
black-box method has attempted to incorporate textual and structural
information to enhance attack performance. However, it is unable to generate
human-readable explanations, and exhibits poor generalizability. In the past
few years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities
in text comprehension, generation, and reasoning. In this paper, we propose
LLMAtKGE, a novel LLM-based framework that selects attack targets and generates
human-readable explanations. To provide the LLM with sufficient factual context
under limited input constraints, we design a structured prompting scheme that
explicitly formulates the attack as multiple-choice questions while
incorporating KG factual evidence. To address the context-window limitation and
hesitation issues, we introduce semantics-based and centrality-based filters,
which compress the candidate set while preserving high recall of
attack-relevant information. Furthermore, to efficiently integrate both
semantic and structural information into the filter, we precompute high-order
adjacency and fine-tune the LLM with a triple classification task to enhance
filtering performance. Experiments on two widely used knowledge graph datasets
demonstrate that our attack outperforms the strongest black-box baselines and
provides explanations via reasoning, and showing competitive performance
compared with white-box methods. Comprehensive ablation and case studies
further validate its capability to generate explanations.

Motivation: 现有研究使用多种方法生成封闭式调查响应，但缺乏标准实践，需要系统评估不同生成方法对模拟调查响应的影响。

Method: 使用8种调查响应生成方法、4个政治态度调查和10个开源语言模型，生成了3200万个模拟调查响应，比较不同方法的个体层面和子群体层面的对齐效果。

Result: 不同调查响应生成方法之间存在显著差异，限制性生成方法整体表现最佳，推理输出不能持续改善对齐效果。

Conclusion: 调查响应生成方法对模拟调查响应有显著影响，研究为调查响应生成方法的应用提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Many in-silico simulations of human survey responses with large language
models (LLMs) focus on generating closed-ended survey responses, whereas LLMs
are typically trained to generate open-ended text instead. Previous research
has used a diverse range of methods for generating closed-ended survey
responses with LLMs, and a standard practice remains to be identified. In this
paper, we systematically investigate the impact that various Survey Response
Generation Methods have on predicted survey responses. We present the results
of 32 mio. simulated survey responses across 8 Survey Response Generation
Methods, 4 political attitude surveys, and 10 open-weight language models. We
find significant differences between the Survey Response Generation Methods in
both individual-level and subpopulation-level alignment. Our results show that
Restricted Generation Methods perform best overall, and that reasoning output
does not consistently improve alignment. Our work underlines the significant
impact that Survey Response Generation Methods have on simulated survey
responses, and we develop practical recommendations on the application of
Survey Response Generation Methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MeTA-LoRA是一个两阶段优化框架，通过任务特定适配器和共享适配器的组合，显著提高了多任务学习中的数据效率，在减少数据使用的同时达到或超越传统全数据LoRA微调的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法在单任务设置中表现良好，但在多任务学习场景中难以有效利用任务间知识，通常需要大量任务特定数据才能达到最优性能。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段使用少量样本学习任务特定LoRA适配器；第二阶段通过聚合多任务梯度更新共享LoRA适配器，促进任务间知识转移。

Result: 在多任务学习和多语言学习场景中，该方法匹配或超越了传统全数据LoRA微调方法的性能，同时显著减少了任务特定数据的使用量。

Conclusion: MeTA-LoRA框架有效解决了多任务学习中数据效率低的问题，通过两阶段优化策略实现了更好的知识迁移和更少的数据依赖。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely used
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for adapting large language
models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. While highly effective in single-task
settings, it struggles to efficiently leverage inter-task knowledge in complex
multi-task learning scenarios, often requiring substantial task-specific data
to achieve optimal performance. To address this limitation, we introduce
MeTA-LoRA, a two-stage optimization framework that significantly improves data
efficiency in multi-task adaptation. In the first stage, task-specific LoRA
adapters are learned using only a few samples from each involved dataset,
enabling rapid adaptation without large-scale supervision. In the second stage,
the shared LoRA adapter is updated by aggregating gradients from multiple tasks
to promote knowledge transfer across tasks, further reducing data usage by
leveraging common patterns. In both multi-task learning and multilingual
learning scenarios, our method matches or surpasses the performance of
traditional full-data LoRA fine-tuning approaches, while using significantly
less task-specific data.

TL;DR: 提出SemCSE-Multi框架，为科学摘要生成多方面的嵌入表示，支持细粒度相似性评估和自适应可视化，并通过解码机制提高可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入方法通常生成单一表示，无法捕捉科学文献的多方面特性，限制了细粒度分析和用户驱动的可视化能力。

Method: 使用无监督方法生成方面特定的摘要句子，训练嵌入模型将相关摘要映射到嵌入空间邻近位置，然后蒸馏到统一模型中实现单次前向预测多维度嵌入。

Result: 在入侵生物学和医学领域验证了框架有效性，能够生成可解释的多方面嵌入，并在低维可视化中保持解码能力。

Conclusion: SemCSE-Multi实现了可控的多方面嵌入生成，显著提升了科学文献分析的可解释性和用户交互能力。

Abstract: We propose SemCSE-Multi, a novel unsupervised framework for generating
multifaceted embeddings of scientific abstracts, evaluated in the domains of
invasion biology and medicine. These embeddings capture distinct, individually
specifiable aspects in isolation, thus enabling fine-grained and controllable
similarity assessments as well as adaptive, user-driven visualizations of
scientific domains. Our approach relies on an unsupervised procedure that
produces aspect-specific summarizing sentences and trains embedding models to
map semantically related summaries to nearby positions in the embedding space.
We then distill these aspect-specific embedding capabilities into a unified
embedding model that directly predicts multiple aspect embeddings from a
scientific abstract in a single, efficient forward pass. In addition, we
introduce an embedding decoding pipeline that decodes embeddings back into
natural language descriptions of their associated aspects. Notably, we show
that this decoding remains effective even for unoccupied regions in
low-dimensional visualizations, thus offering vastly improved interpretability
in user-centric settings.

TL;DR: 本文系统解构了Transformer注意力机制，发现token混合机制不可或缺，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer语言模型的成功通常归功于其点积注意力机制，但该机制中各个设计原则的必要性尚未得到充分验证。

Method: 设计受控变体，选择性地放松注意力机制的不同原则，包括在全部层均匀应用和在混合架构中仅在部分层保留标准注意力。

Result: token混合机制缺失会导致模型性能崩溃至接近随机水平，而数学形式和序列依赖性可以大幅简化，特别是在部分层保留标准注意力时。令人惊讶的是，单独失败的变体在与标准注意力交错使用时也能获得稳健性能。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对注意力机制有效性的理解，为简化语言模型而不牺牲性能开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The success of Transformer language models is widely credited to their
dot-product attention mechanism, which interweaves a set of key design
principles: mixing information across positions (enabling multi-token
interactions), sequence-dependent activations (where attention weights adapt to
each input), a specific mathematical form (dot-product similarities plus
softmax weighting), and coupling of queries and keys to evolving hidden states
(grounding attention in the current layer). However, the necessity of each of
these principles remains largely untested. In this work, we systematically
deconstruct attention by designing controlled variants that selectively relax
these principles, applied both uniformly across all layers and in hybrid
architectures where only some layers retain standard attention. Our empirical
analysis reveals that mechanisms for mixing tokens are indispensable, as their
absence collapses models to near-random behavior, while the exact mathematical
form and sequence dependency can be substantially relaxed, especially when
preserved in just a subset of layers. Surprisingly, even variants that fail in
isolation can achieve robust performance when interleaved with standard
attention, highlighting a cooperative effect. These findings deepen our
understanding of what truly underpins attention's effectiveness and open new
avenues for simplifying language models without sacrificing performance.

<details>

Motivation: 传统的基于logit的知识蒸馏方法采用静态策略，与学生学习过程的动态特性不匹配，导致知识转移效果不佳。

Method: AdaKD框架包含两个协同模块：LATF模块动态监控学生学习稳定性来调整蒸馏焦点；IDTS模块根据令牌难度实施差异化温度策略。

Result: AdaKD能够持续提升多种蒸馏方法在不同模型架构和基准测试上的性能。

Conclusion: AdaKD作为一个即插即用框架，通过适应性的令牌级蒸馏策略有效改进了知识蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a key technique for compressing large-scale
language models (LLMs), yet prevailing logit-based methods typically employ
static strategies that are misaligned with the dynamic learning process of
student models. These methods typically treat all tokens indiscriminately and
apply a single, fixed temperature, resulting in suboptimal knowledge transfer.
To address these limitations, we propose LLM-Oriented Token-Adaptive Knowledge
Distillation (AdaKD), a novel framework that adapts the distillation process to
the real-time learning state of each token. AdaKD consists of two synergistic
modules driven by a unified token difficulty metric. First, our Loss-Driven
Adaptive Token Focusing (LATF) module dynamically adjusts the distillation
focus by monitoring the student's learning stability, concentrating
computational resources on the most valuable tokens at each training phase.
Second, we introduce Inverse Difficulty Temperature Scaling (IDTS), a
counterintuitive yet effective token-level temperature strategy. It employs low
temperatures for difficult tokens for targeted error correction, and high
temperatures for easy tokens to encourage students to learn from the teacher's
complete and smooth output distribution, thereby enhancing generalization. As a
plug-and-play framework, AdaKD can consistently improve the performance of
various distillation methods on multiple model architectures and benchmarks.

Abstract: Human writers often begin their stories with an overarching mental scene,
where they envision the interactions between characters and their environment.
Inspired by this creative process, we propose a novel approach to long-form
story generation, termed hybrid bottom-up long-form story generation, using
multi-agent simulations. In our method, agents interact within a dynamic
sandbox environment, where their behaviors and interactions with one another
and the environment generate emergent events. These events form the foundation
for the story, enabling organic character development and plot progression.
Unlike traditional top-down approaches that impose rigid structures, our hybrid
bottom-up approach allows for the natural unfolding of events, fostering more
spontaneous and engaging storytelling. The system is capable of generating
stories exceeding 10,000 words while maintaining coherence and consistency,
addressing some of the key challenges faced by current story generation models.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance across several metrics. This approach
offers a scalable and innovative solution for creating dynamic, immersive
long-form stories that evolve organically from agent-driven interactions.

Conclusion: MPPA框架有效解决了长推理链中的错误累积问题，通过计划探索和过程级优化显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling enhances the reasoning ability of a language model
(LM) by extending its chain-of-thought (CoT). However, existing approaches
typically generate the entire reasoning chain in a single forward pass, which
often leads to CoT derailment, i.e., the reasoning trajectory drifting off
course due to compounding errors. This problem is particularly severe for
smaller LMs with long CoTs due to their limited capacity. To address this, we
analyze raw long CoTs and uncover a reasoning hierarchy consisting of planning
and execution steps. Our analysis reveals that most reasoning errors stem from
incorrect planning. Motivated by this observation, we propose Multi-Path Plan
Aggregation (MPPA), a framework that augments single-pass reasoning with plan
exploration and aggregation. Following a variable interval schedule based on
the token position, MPPA generates multiple candidate plans and aggregates them
into a refined planning step. To maintain efficiency, we adopt a minimal design
in which the base LM serves as the primary policy, while a lightweight LoRA
module implements the plan aggregation policy. We further observe that
outcome-reward RL is inefficient for long trajectories (e.g., exceeding 4K
tokens). To overcome this, we introduce online Step-DPO, a process-level
preference optimization scheme that leverages Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo
(TSMC) to provide scalable stepwise supervision using small LMs. This yields
more efficient training, improved stability, and higher accuracy. Extensive
experiments on challenging math, science, and logical reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that, with only 10% SFT data and 5% of preference pairs, our method
outperforms both the DeepSeek-R1 distillation baseline and the outcome-reward
RL baseline across multiple base models and tasks.

Abstract: In recent years, the research focus of large language models (LLMs) and
agents has shifted increasingly from demonstrating novel capabilities to
complex reasoning and tackling challenging tasks. However, existing evaluations
focus mainly on math/code contests or general tasks, while existing
multi-domain academic benchmarks lack sufficient reasoning depth, leaving the
field without a rigorous benchmark for high-level reasoning. To fill this gap,
we introduce the Acadreason benchmark, designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs
and agents to acquire and reason over academic knowledge. It consists of 50
expert-annotated academic problems across five high-reasoning domains,
including computer science, economics, law, mathematics, and philosophy. All
questions are sourced from top-tier publications in recent years and undergo
rigorous annotation and quality control to ensure they are both challenging and
answerable. We conduct systematic evaluations of over 10 mainstream LLMs and
agents. The results show that most LLMs scored below 20 points, with even the
cutting-edge GPT-5 achieving only 16 points. While agents achieved higher
scores, none exceeded 40 points. This demonstrates the current capability gap
between LLMs and agents in super-intelligent academic research tasks and
highlights the challenges of Acadreason.

Abstract: Recent multimodal embedding approaches leveraging multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) fine-tuned with contrastive learning (CL) have shown promising
results, yet the underlying reasons behind their superiority remain
underexplored. This work argues that a crucial advantage of MLLM-based
approaches stems from implicit cross-modal alignment achieved during generative
pretraining, where the language decoder learns to exploit multimodal signals
within a shared representation space for generating unimodal outputs. Through
analysis of anisotropy and kernel similarity structure, we empirically confirm
that latent alignment emerges within MLLM representations, allowing CL to serve
as a lightweight refinement stage. Leveraging this insight, we propose a
Language-Centric Omnimodal Embedding framework, termed LCO-Emb. Extensive
experiments across diverse backbones and benchmarks demonstrate its
effectiveness, achieving state-of-the-art performance across modalities.
Furthermore, we identify a Generation-Representation Scaling Law (GRSL),
showing that the representational capabilities gained through contrastive
refinement scales positively with the MLLM's generative capabilities. This
suggests that improving generative abilities evolves as an effective paradigm
for enhancing representation quality. We provide a theoretical explanation of
GRSL, which formally links the MLLM's generative quality to the upper bound on
its representation performance, and validate it on a challenging, low-resource
visual-document retrieval task, showing that continual generative pretraining
before CL can further enhance the potential of a model's embedding
capabilities. Codes, models, and resources are available at

TL;DR: AMA是首个终身实时基准测试平台，用于评估基于LLM的交易代理在多个市场中的表现，解决了现有研究测试模型而非代理、覆盖期有限、依赖未验证数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理在金融交易中的研究存在不足：大多测试模型而非代理、覆盖期和资产有限、依赖未验证数据，需要建立更严谨的评估框架。

Method: 引入Agent Market Arena (AMA)平台，整合验证交易数据、专家审核新闻和多样化代理架构，实现四种代理（InvestorAgent、TradeAgent、HedgeFundAgent、DeepFundAgent）在GPT-4o、GPT-4.1、Claude-3.5-haiku、Claude-sonnet-4、Gemini-2.0-flash上的实时评估。

Result: 加密货币和股票市场的实时实验显示，代理框架表现出显著不同的行为模式（从激进风险承担到保守决策），而模型骨干对结果差异贡献较小。

Conclusion: AMA为基于LLM的金融推理和交易智能提供了严谨、可复现且持续演进的评估基础。

Abstract: Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used in
financial trading, it remains unclear whether they can reason and adapt in live
markets, as most studies test models instead of agents, cover limited periods
and assets, and rely on unverified data. To address these gaps, we introduce
Agent Market Arena (AMA), the first lifelong, real-time benchmark for
evaluating LLM-based trading agents across multiple markets. AMA integrates
verified trading data, expert-checked news, and diverse agent architectures
within a unified trading framework, enabling fair and continuous comparison
under real conditions. It implements four agents, including InvestorAgent as a
single-agent baseline, TradeAgent and HedgeFundAgent with different risk
styles, and DeepFundAgent with memory-based reasoning, and evaluates them
across GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude-3.5-haiku, Claude-sonnet-4, and
Gemini-2.0-flash. Live experiments on both cryptocurrency and stock markets
demonstrate that agent frameworks display markedly distinct behavioral
patterns, spanning from aggressive risk-taking to conservative decision-making,
whereas model backbones contribute less to outcome variation. AMA thus
establishes a foundation for rigorous, reproducible, and continuously evolving
evaluation of financial reasoning and trading intelligence in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了强化学习在智能体推理中的关键设计原则，发现真实端到端工具使用轨迹、探索友好技术和深思熟虑策略能显著提升训练效率和推理能力，使小模型达到大模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然智能体强化学习已证明能提升LLMs的推理能力，但其关键设计原则和最佳实践仍不明确，需要系统研究来揭示强化学习在智能体推理中的作用机制。

Method: 从数据、算法和推理模式三个关键角度进行系统研究：使用真实端到端工具使用轨迹替代合成轨迹；采用探索友好技术如clip higher、奖励塑形和保持策略熵；比较不同推理策略的效果。

Result: 提出的简单实践方法能持续增强智能体推理和训练效率，在挑战性基准测试中取得强劲结果，4B模型可达到32B模型的推理性能。

Conclusion: 研究确立了智能体强化学习的实用基线，为未来研究提供了高质量数据集和有效方法，证明了小模型通过适当训练也能具备强大推理能力。

Abstract: Recently, the emergence of agentic RL has showcased that RL could also
effectively improve the agentic reasoning ability of LLMs, yet the key design
principles and optimal practices remain unclear. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive and systematic investigation to demystify reinforcement learning
in agentic reasoning from three key perspectives: data, algorithm, and
reasoning mode. We highlight our key insights: (i) Replacing stitched synthetic
trajectories with real end-to-end tool-use trajectories yields a far stronger
SFT initialization; high-diversity, model-aware datasets sustain exploration
and markedly improve RL performance. (ii) Exploration-friendly techniques are
crucial for agentic RL, such as clip higher, overlong reward shaping, and
maintaining adequate policy entropy could improve the training efficiency.
(iii) A deliberative strategy with fewer tool calls outperforms frequent tool
calls or verbose self-reasoning, improving tool efficiency and final accuracy.
Together, these simple practices consistently enhance agentic reasoning and
training efficiency, achieving strong results on challenging benchmarks with
smaller models, and establishing a practical baseline for future agentic RL
research. Beyond these empirical insights, we further contribute a
high-quality, real end-to-end agentic SFT dataset along with a high-quality RL
dataset, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our insights in boosting the
agentic reasoning ability of LLMs across four challenging benchmarks, including
AIME2024/AIME2025, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench-v6. With our recipes,
4B-sized models could also achieve superior agentic reasoning performance
compared to 32B-sized models. Code and models:

*Tsung-Han Wu,Mihran Miroyan,David M. Chan,Trevor Darrell,Narges Norouzi,Joseph E. Gonzalez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了大型推理模型在静态评估中的"冻结世界"假设，通过中断和动态上下文两种现实场景测试模型鲁棒性，发现静态评估会高估模型性能，在动态环境下模型准确率可能下降高达60%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估假设模型响应是瞬时的、上下文在响应期间保持不变，但这在现代推理任务（如辅助编程）中不成立，因为模型可能需要数小时思考，而代码在此期间可能发生显著变化。

Method: 在数学和编程基准测试中，评估LRM在两种动态场景下的表现：中断（测试模型在有限预算下的部分输出质量）和动态上下文（测试模型对飞行中变化的适应能力）。

Result: 静态评估一致高估鲁棒性：即使在静态设置中达到高准确率的最先进LRM，在中断或暴露于变化上下文时也会不可预测地失败，当更新在推理过程后期引入时性能下降高达60%。

Conclusion: 发现了新的失败模式：推理泄漏（中断时模型将推理折叠到最终答案中）、恐慌（时间压力下模型完全放弃推理返回错误答案）和自我怀疑（整合更新信息时性能下降）。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are
traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are
assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be
immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for
short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning
tasks such as assistive programming, where models may take hours to think
through problems and code may change dramatically from the time the model
starts thinking to the model's final output. In this work, we challenge the
frozen world assumption and evaluate LRM robustness under two realistic dynamic
scenarios: interruptions, which test the quality of the model's partial outputs
on a limited budget, and dynamic context, which tests model adaptation to
in-flight changes. Across mathematics and programming benchmarks that require
long-form reasoning, static evaluations consistently overestimate robustness:
even state-of-the-art LRMs, which achieve high accuracy in static settings, can
fail unpredictably when interrupted or exposed to changing context, with
performance dropping by up to 60% when updates are introduced late in the
reasoning process. Our analysis further reveals several novel failure modes,
including reasoning leakage, where models fold the reasoning into their final
answer when interrupted; panic, where under time pressure models abandon
reasoning entirely and return incorrect answers; and self-doubt, where
performance degrades while incorporating updated information.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出几何框架将LLM推理建模为表示空间中的流，通过自然演绎命题分离逻辑结构与语义，验证LLM是否内化超越表面形式的逻辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM如何在表示空间中"思考"，探索其是否真正内化逻辑结构而非仅依赖表面语义模式。

Method: 使用相同自然演绎命题搭配不同语义载体，在表示空间中追踪嵌入轨迹，分析位置、速度和曲率等几何量。

Result: 理论证明LLM推理对应表示空间中的平滑流，逻辑语句作为这些流速率的局部控制器；通过表示代理设计实验可视化推理流。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究LLM推理现象提供概念基础和实践工具，为LLM行为可解释性和形式分析提供新视角。

Abstract: We study how large language models (LLMs) ``think'' through their
representation space. We propose a novel geometric framework that models an
LLM's reasoning as flows -- embedding trajectories evolving where logic goes.
We disentangle logical structure from semantics by employing the same natural
deduction propositions with varied semantic carriers, allowing us to test
whether LLMs internalize logic beyond surface form. This perspective connects
reasoning with geometric quantities such as position, velocity, and curvature,
enabling formal analysis in representation and concept spaces. Our theory
establishes: (1) LLM reasoning corresponds to smooth flows in representation
space, and (2) logical statements act as local controllers of these flows'
velocities. Using learned representation proxies, we design controlled
experiments to visualize and quantify reasoning flows, providing empirical
validation of our theoretical framework. Our work serves as both a conceptual
foundation and practical tools for studying reasoning phenomenon, offering a
new lens for interpretability and formal analysis of LLMs' behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试大多假设完全自动化，未能反映真实世界中人机协作的使用场景，需要更严谨地评估人机交互。

Method: 提出PULSE框架：收集用户反馈 → 训练ML模型预测用户满意度 → 结合人类满意度评分和模型生成的伪标签计算结果。在OpenHands平台上大规模部署，收集了超过1.5万用户的使用数据。

Result: 1. 框架使智能体设计的置信区间比标准A/B测试减少40%；2. 发现野外结果与基准性能存在显著差异（如claude-sonnet-4与gpt-5结果呈负相关）；3. 获得了关于LLM骨干、规划策略和记忆机制对开发者满意度的实用见解。

Conclusion: 基准驱动评估存在局限性，PULSE框架为LLM智能体的人类评估提供指导，并识别了改进智能体设计的机会。

Abstract: LLM-powered agents are both a promising new technology and a source of
complexity, where choices about models, tools, and prompting can affect their
usefulness. While numerous benchmarks measure agent accuracy across domains,
they mostly assume full automation, failing to represent the collaborative
nature of real-world use cases. In this paper, we make two major steps towards
the rigorous assessment of human-agent interactions. First, we propose PULSE, a
framework for more efficient human-centric evaluation of agent designs, which
comprises collecting user feedback, training an ML model to predict user
satisfaction, and computing results by combining human satisfaction ratings
with model-generated pseudo-labels. Second, we deploy the framework on a
large-scale web platform built around the open-source software agent OpenHands,
collecting in-the-wild usage data across over 15k users. We conduct case
studies around how three agent design decisions -- choice of LLM backbone,
planning strategy, and memory mechanisms -- impact developer satisfaction
rates, yielding practical insights for software agent design. We also show how
our framework can lead to more robust conclusions about agent design, reducing
confidence intervals by 40\% compared to a standard A/B test. Finally, we find
substantial discrepancies between in-the-wild results and benchmark performance
(e.g., the anti-correlation between results comparing claude-sonnet-4 and
gpt-5), underscoring the limitations of benchmark-driven evaluation. Our
findings provide guidance for evaluations of LLM agents with humans and
identify opportunities for better agent designs.

Motivation: 现有的地球观测驱动表示主要捕捉物理和光谱模式，缺乏对城市功能和社会经济维度的表征，需要融合人类活动信息

Method: 提出AETHER轻量级框架，通过多模态对齐将AlphaEarth嵌入与POI文本表示对齐，丰富物理特征的城市功能语义

Result: 在伦敦地区，AETHER相比AE基线在土地利用分类F1得分提升7.2%，社会经济映射的KL散度降低23.6%

Conclusion: 通过耦合地球观测与人类中心语义，AETHER推进了地理空间基础模型向整合物理形态和功能意义的通用城市表示发展

Abstract: General-purpose spatial representations are essential for building
transferable geospatial foundation models (GFMs). Among them, the AlphaEarth
Foundation (AE) represents a major step toward a global, unified representation
of the Earth's surface, learning 10-meter embeddings from multi-source Earth
Observation (EO) data that capture rich physical and environmental patterns
across diverse landscapes. However, such EO-driven representations remain
limited in capturing the functional and socioeconomic dimensions of cities, as
they primarily encode physical and spectral patterns rather than human
activities or spatial functions. We propose AETHER (AlphaEarth-POI Enriched
Representation Learning), a lightweight framework that adapts AlphaEarth to
human-centered urban analysis through multimodal alignment guided by Points of
Interest (POIs). AETHER aligns AE embeddings with textual representations of
POIs, enriching physically grounded EO features with semantic cues about urban
functions and socioeconomic contexts. In Greater London, AETHER achieves
consistent gains over the AE baseline, with a 7.2% relative improvement in
land-use classification F1 and a 23.6% relative reduction in Kullback-Leibler
divergence for socioeconomic mapping. Built upon pretrained AE, AETHER
leverages a lightweight multimodal alignment to enrich it with human-centered
semantics while remaining computationally efficient and scalable for urban
applications. By coupling EO with human-centered semantics, it advances
geospatial foundation models toward general-purpose urban representations that
integrate both physical form and functional meaning.

Abstract: Computing has long served as a cornerstone of scientific discovery. Recently,
a paradigm shift has emerged with the rise of large language models (LLMs),
introducing autonomous systems, referred to as agents, that accelerate
discovery across varying levels of autonomy. These language agents provide a
flexible and versatile framework that orchestrates interactions with human
scientists, natural language, computer language and code, and physics. This
paper presents our view and vision of LLM-based scientific agents and their
growing role in transforming the scientific discovery lifecycle, from
hypothesis discovery, experimental design and execution, to result analysis and
refinement. We critically examine current methodologies, emphasizing key
innovations, practical achievements, and outstanding limitations. Additionally,
we identify open research challenges and outline promising directions for
building more robust, generalizable, and adaptive scientific agents. Our
analysis highlights the transformative potential of autonomous agents to
accelerate scientific discovery across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 研究发现，当AI系统整合用户长期记忆时，不同用户档案会导致系统性的情感理解偏差，优势群体获得更准确的情感解读，个人化机制可能强化社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着个性化AI系统越来越多地整合长期用户记忆，理解这种记忆如何影响情感推理变得至关重要。

Method: 在15个大型语言模型上进行人类验证的情感智能测试，评估相同情境下不同用户档案对情感解读的影响。

Result: 相同情境配对不同用户档案会产生系统性分歧的情感解读，多个高性能LLM中出现系统性偏差，优势群体获得更准确的情感理解，在情感理解和支持性建议任务中存在显著的人口统计因素差异。

Conclusion: 为个性化设计的系统可能无意中强化社会不平等，这是记忆增强AI面临的关键挑战。

Abstract: When an AI assistant remembers that Sarah is a single mother working two
jobs, does it interpret her stress differently than if she were a wealthy
executive? As personalized AI systems increasingly incorporate long-term user
memory, understanding how this memory shapes emotional reasoning is critical.
We investigate how user memory affects emotional intelligence in large language
models (LLMs) by evaluating 15 models on human validated emotional intelligence
tests. We find that identical scenarios paired with different user profiles
produce systematically divergent emotional interpretations. Across validated
user independent emotional scenarios and diverse user profiles, systematic
biases emerged in several high-performing LLMs where advantaged profiles
received more accurate emotional interpretations. Moreover, LLMs demonstrate
significant disparities across demographic factors in emotion understanding and
supportive recommendations tasks, indicating that personalization mechanisms
can embed social hierarchies into models emotional reasoning. These results
highlight a key challenge for memory enhanced AI: systems designed for
personalization may inadvertently reinforce social inequalities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本、基于指令的干预方法，通过分步指令数据集和知识图谱验证，显著提升LLM在逻辑谬误分类中的表现和决策透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在关键推理缺陷，包括产生幻觉和在逻辑谬误分类中准确性差，这源于其默认的快速直觉式系统1处理，而可靠推理需要深思熟虑的系统2方法。

Method: 引入新颖的分步指令数据集，将谬误分类分解为一系列原子程序步骤（简单二元问题），并通过咨询相关谬误关系知识图谱进行最终验证。

Result: 这种基于程序规则的干预显著提高了LLM的逻辑谬误分类能力，同时增强了决策过程的透明度。

Conclusion: 该方法为神经符号架构解决LLM推理缺陷提供了一条实用路径，展示了低成本指令干预在提升模型推理能力方面的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from critical reasoning gaps, including a
tendency to hallucinate and poor accuracy in classifying logical fallacies.
This limitation stems from their default System 1 processing, which is fast and
intuitive, whereas reliable reasoning requires the deliberate, effortful System
2 approach (Kahneman, 2011; Li et al., 2025). Since full System 2 training is
often prohibitively expensive, we explore a low-cost, instruction-based
intervention to bridge this gap. Our methodology introduces a novel stepwise
instruction dataset that decomposes fallacy classification into a series of
atomic procedural steps (simple binary questions). We further augment this with
a final verification step where models consult a relational knowledge graph of
related fallacies. This procedural, rule-based intervention yields a
significant improvement in LLM logical fallacy classification. Crucially, the
approach also provides enhanced transparency into the LLMs' decision-making,
highlighting a practical pathway for Neuro-symbolic architectures to address
LLM reasoning deficits.

TL;DR: 该研究通过LLM辩论分析多轮对话中的道德推理和价值对齐，发现不同模型在同步和轮询辩论格式下表现出显著的行为差异，GPT强调个人自主权而Claude和Gemini更注重同理心对话，辩论格式对模型行为有强烈影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在敏感日常场景中的部署，理解它们在复杂道德推理中的价值取向至关重要。现有研究多关注单轮提示，但多轮对话中价值通过对话、修订和共识形成的方式尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM辩论方法，让GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7 Sonnet和Gemini 2.0 Flash三个模型的子集在Reddit的"Am I the Asshole"社区的1000个日常困境中集体分配责任，采用同步（并行响应）和轮询（顺序响应）格式测试顺序效应和裁决修订。

Result: 发现显著行为差异：同步设置中GPT表现出强惯性（0.6-3.1%修订率），而Claude和Gemini更灵活（28-41%）。价值模式也不同：GPT强调个人自主权和直接沟通，Claude和Gemini优先考虑同理心对话。某些价值观在驱动裁决变化方面特别有效。

Conclusion: 辩论格式和模型特定行为在多轮互动中塑造道德推理，表明社会技术对齐不仅取决于系统输出，还取决于对话结构方式。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive
everyday contexts - offering personal advice, mental health support, and moral
guidance - understanding their elicited values in navigating complex moral
reasoning is essential. Most evaluations study this sociotechnical alignment
through single-turn prompts, but it is unclear if these findings extend to
multi-turn settings where values emerge through dialogue, revision, and
consensus. We address this gap using LLM debate to examine deliberative
dynamics and value alignment in multi-turn settings by prompting subsets of
three models (GPT-4.1, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) to collectively
assign blame in 1,000 everyday dilemmas from Reddit's "Am I the Asshole"
community. We use both synchronous (parallel responses) and round-robin
(sequential responses) formats to test order effects and verdict revision. Our
findings show striking behavioral differences. In the synchronous setting, GPT
showed strong inertia (0.6-3.1% revision rates) while Claude and Gemini were
far more flexible (28-41%). Value patterns also diverged: GPT emphasized
personal autonomy and direct communication, while Claude and Gemini prioritized
empathetic dialogue. Certain values proved especially effective at driving
verdict changes. We further find that deliberation format had a strong impact
on model behavior: GPT and Gemini stood out as highly conforming relative to
Claude, with their verdict behavior strongly shaped by order effects. These
results show how deliberation format and model-specific behaviors shape moral
reasoning in multi-turn interactions, underscoring that sociotechnical
alignment depends on how systems structure dialogue as much as on their
outputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对简化的RAG架构进行白盒攻击，而实际攻击场景中攻击者通常不了解RAG系统的内部组成和实现细节，且RAG系统包含多个组件。

Method: 使用强化学习优化生成模型，生成符合目标RAG系统偏好的有毒文档，将目标RAG系统视为黑盒，攻击者只能获取攻击是否成功的信息。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法能有效攻击大多数复杂RAG系统，攻击成功率相比基线方法提升高达0.72。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了当前防御方法的普遍缺陷，为LLM安全研究提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems based on Large Language Models
(LLMs) have become a core technology for tasks such as question-answering (QA)
and content generation. However, by injecting poisoned documents into the
database of RAG systems, attackers can manipulate LLMs to generate text that
aligns with their intended preferences. Existing research has primarily focused
on white-box attacks against simplified RAG architectures. In this paper, we
investigate a more complex and realistic scenario: the attacker lacks knowledge
of the RAG system's internal composition and implementation details, and the
RAG system comprises components beyond a mere retriever. Specifically, we
propose the RIPRAG attack framework, an end-to-end attack pipeline that treats
the target RAG system as a black box, where the only information accessible to
the attacker is whether the poisoning succeeds. Our method leverages
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the generation model for poisoned
documents, ensuring that the generated poisoned document aligns with the target
RAG system's preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can
effectively execute poisoning attacks against most complex RAG systems,
achieving an attack success rate (ASR) improvement of up to 0.72 compared to
baseline methods. This highlights prevalent deficiencies in current defensive
methods and provides critical insights for LLM security research.

TL;DR: 提出CE-Graph框架，将LLM工作流优化重新定义为分布问题，通过最小化预期失败质量来系统性地学习失败分布结构，实现更高效和鲁棒的优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于标量指标的全局搜索方法存在信息坍缩问题，将丰富的多步骤执行轨迹简化为成功/失败信号，无法建模工作流的失败分布结构。

Method: 引入失败签名空间(FSS)概念，提出CE-Graph框架：从反例池近似失败分布，识别最密集区域作为重复失败模式，通过提议-验证机制应用有针对性的图编辑来贪婪地减少失败质量。

Result: 在数学、代码和QA基准测试中，CE-Graph以显著更低的成本实现了比强基线更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 系统的可靠性不是来自避免失败，而是来自系统性地学习和重塑其失败分布的几何结构。

Abstract: Optimizing LLM-based workflows is typically formulated as a global search,
where candidate workflows are evaluated based on a scalar metric. This
paradigm, however, suffers from a critical flaw: information collapse. By
reducing rich, multi-step execution traces to simple success/failure signals,
existing methods are rendered blind to the underlying structure of failures,
fundamentally preventing them from modeling the workflow's failure
distribution. We reconceptualize this challenge as a distributional problem. We
propose a new paradigm where the optimization goal is not to maximize a scalar
score, but to directly minimize a workflow's Expected Failure Mass, i.e., the
integral of its failure probability density function defined over a
high-dimensional Failure Signature Space (FSS). This distributional lens allows
us to move from inefficient, zero-order optimization to a principled,
gradient-like descent on the failure landscape itself. We introduce CE-Graph, a
framework that operationalizes this paradigm through a novel, failure-driven
refinement process. CE-Graph approximates the failure distribution from a pool
of counterexamples, identifies its densest regions as recurring failure modes,
and applies targeted, operator-constrained graph edits via a Propose-and-Verify
mechanism to greedily reduce the failure mass. On math, code, and QA
benchmarks, our CE-Graph achieves higher robustness at a significantly lower
cost than strong baselines. This suggests that a system's reliability emerges
not from avoiding failures, but from systematically learning and reshaping the
geometric structure of its failure distributions.

*Saleh Nikooroo,Thomas Engel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个图论框架，将可信度（外部信任）与置信度（网络结构产生的内部价值）分离，通过收缩传播过程获得稳定置信度，并定义推理区域作为高置信度、结构平衡的子图，支持局部经典推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信念系统通常存在全局不一致性，但局部推理仍然有效。需要一种能够容忍矛盾、在结构支持的局部区域激活经典逻辑的推理框架。

Method: 构建有向、带符号、加权的信念图，通过收缩传播过程计算置信度，使用基于奇偶性的着色测试平衡性，并通过贪婪修复构建紧凑的推理区域图谱。

Result: 提供了近线性算法来恢复推理区域，在合成签名图中展示了区域恢复能力、冲击下的稳定性以及运行时间表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为容忍矛盾的推理提供了原则性基础，能够在结构支持的精确位置激活经典逻辑，实现局部有效推理。

Abstract: Belief systems are rarely globally consistent, yet effective reasoning often
persists locally. We propose a novel graph-theoretic framework that cleanly
separates credibility--external, a priori trust in sources--from confidence--an
internal, emergent valuation induced by network structure. Beliefs are nodes in
a directed, signed, weighted graph whose edges encode support and
contradiction. Confidence is obtained by a contractive propagation process that
mixes a stated prior with structure-aware influence and guarantees a unique,
stable solution. Within this dynamics, we define reasoning zones:
high-confidence, structurally balanced subgraphs on which classical inference
is safe despite global contradictions. We provide a near-linear procedure that
seeds zones by confidence, tests balance using a parity-based coloring, and
applies a greedy, locality-preserving repair with Jaccard de-duplication to
build a compact atlas. To model belief change, we introduce shock updates that
locally downscale support and elevate targeted contradictions while preserving
contractivity via a simple backtracking rule. Re-propagation yields localized
reconfiguration-zones may shrink, split, or collapse--without destabilizing the
entire graph. We outline an empirical protocol on synthetic signed graphs with
planted zones, reporting zone recovery, stability under shocks, and runtime.
The result is a principled foundation for contradiction-tolerant reasoning that
activates classical logic precisely where structure supports it.

TL;DR: SwarmSys是一个受群体智能启发的分布式多智能体推理框架，通过探索者、工作者和验证者三个角色的迭代交互实现闭环推理，无需全局监督即可实现动态任务分配和自组织收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体框架通常依赖固定角色或集中控制，限制了长时程推理的可扩展性和适应性，需要一种更灵活、可扩展的协作机制。

Method: 集成自适应智能体和事件配置文件、基于嵌入的概率匹配以及信息素启发的强化机制，支持动态任务分配和自组织收敛。

Result: 在符号推理、研究综合和科学编程任务中，SwarmSys始终优于基线方法，提高了准确性和推理稳定性。

Conclusion: 群体启发的协调机制是构建可扩展、鲁棒和自适应多智能体推理的有前景范式，协调扩展可能与模型扩展在推进LLM智能方面相媲美。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable reasoning abilities.
However, existing multi-agent frameworks often rely on fixed roles or
centralized control, limiting scalability and adaptability in long-horizon
reasoning. We introduce SwarmSys, a closed-loop framework for distributed
multi-agent reasoning inspired by swarm intelligence. Coordination in SwarmSys
emerges through iterative interactions among three specialized roles,
Explorers, Workers, and Validators, that continuously cycle through
exploration, exploitation, and validation. To enable scalable and adaptive
collaboration, we integrate adaptive agent and event profiles, embedding-based
probabilistic matching, and a pheromone-inspired reinforcement mechanism,
supporting dynamic task allocation and self-organizing convergence without
global supervision. Across symbolic reasoning, research synthesis, and
scientific programming tasks, SwarmSys consistently outperforms baselines,
improving both accuracy and reasoning stability. These findings highlight
swarm-inspired coordination as a promising paradigm for scalable, robust, and
adaptive multi-agent reasoning, suggesting that coordination scaling may rival
model scaling in advancing LLM intelligence.

TL;DR: SyncLipMAE是一个自监督预训练框架，通过掩码视觉建模和跨模态对比对齐，从无标签的视听流中学习同步感知和可转移的面部动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的说话人脸视频方法缺乏对同步感知面部动态的系统性学习，需要一种能够学习可转移面部动态并支持多种下游任务的统一框架。

Method: 结合掩码视觉建模与跨模态对比对齐，使用三个逐帧提示令牌编码身份、语音同步面部动态和音频无关运动，通过对比学习实现音频-视觉流同步。

Result: 在四个需要不同能力的任务家族中取得最先进结果，包括视听流同步、面部情感识别、视觉语音识别和视觉配音。

Conclusion: 同步感知、分解的自监督预训练在多个下游任务中表现出有效性，证明了该框架的通用性和强大性能。

Abstract: We introduce SyncLipMAE, a self-supervised pretraining framework for
talking-face video that learns synchronization-aware and transferable facial
dynamics from unlabeled audio-visual streams. Our approach couples masked
visual modeling with cross-modal contrastive alignment and employs three
per-frame prompt tokens that explicitly encode the essential factors of a
talking-face frame - identity, vocal motion (speech-synchronized facial
dynamics), and ambient motion (audio-agnostic movements such as blinks and head
pose). The contrastive objective uses time-aligned vocal-motion and audio
tokens as positives and misaligned pairs as negatives, driving both modalities
into a shared embedding space and yielding token-level audio-visual stream
synchronization. After pretraining, the aligned audio tokens together with the
visual prompt tokens (identity, vocal motion, ambient motion) form a unified
interface for four disparate downstream settings: (i) audio-visual stream
synchronization; (ii) facial emotion and head/face action recognition; (iii)
visual speech recognition; and (iv) visual dubbing, for which we enable
indistinguishable audio- or video-driven control within a single model. Across
four task families that require distinct capabilities, SyncLipMAE achieves
state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness of
synchronization-aware, factorized self-supervised pretraining.

TL;DR: StepFly是一个端到端的自动化故障排除指南框架，通过三阶段工作流程提升TSG质量、提取结构化执行DAG并支持并行执行，在真实TSG上达到约94%的成功率，显著减少执行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模IT系统中的故障排除指南手动执行缓慢且易出错，现有LLM解决方案缺乏对TSG质量问题、复杂控制流解释、数据密集型查询和执行并行化的专门支持。

Method: 三阶段工作流程：1) TSG Mentor工具协助SRE改进TSG质量；2) 离线预处理使用LLM从非结构化TSG提取结构化执行DAG并创建专用查询准备插件；3) 在线执行使用DAG引导的调度器-执行器框架，支持并行执行独立步骤。

Result: 在真实TSG和事件上的评估显示，StepFly在GPT-4.1上达到约94%的成功率，优于基线方法，时间和token消耗更少。对于可并行TSG，执行时间减少32.9%至70.4%。

Conclusion: StepFly框架有效解决了TSG自动化中的关键挑战，显著提升了故障排除的效率和成功率，为大规模IT系统的事件管理提供了实用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Effective incident management in large-scale IT systems relies on
troubleshooting guides (TSGs), but their manual execution is slow and
error-prone. While recent advances in LLMs offer promise for automating
incident management tasks, existing LLM-based solutions lack specialized
support for several key challenges, including managing TSG quality issues,
interpreting complex control flow, handling data-intensive queries, and
exploiting execution parallelism. We first conducted an empirical study on 92
real-world TSGs, and, guided by our findings, we present StepFly, a novel
end-to-end agentic framework for troubleshooting guide automation. Our approach
features a three-stage workflow: the first stage provides a comprehensive guide
together with a tool, TSG Mentor, to assist SREs in improving TSG quality; the
second stage performs offline preprocessing using LLMs to extract structured
execution DAGs from unstructured TSGs and to create dedicated Query Preparation
Plugins (QPPs); and the third stage executes online using a DAG-guided
scheduler-executor framework with a memory system to guarantee correct workflow
and support parallel execution of independent steps. Our empirical evaluation
on a collection of real-world TSGs and incidents demonstrates that StepFly
achieves a ~94% success rate on GPT-4.1, outperforming baselines with less time
and token consumption. Furthermore, it achieves a remarkable execution time
reduction of 32.9% to 70.4% for parallelizable TSGs.

TL;DR: 提出了DixitWorld评估套件，包含动态多代理环境DixitArena和静态QA基准DixitBench，用于评估视觉语言模型的多模态溯因推理能力，发现生成创造性和判别理解之间存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉语言模型多模态溯因推理能力的评估主要局限于静态、单代理任务，需要更全面的评估框架来解构这一挑战。

Method: 开发DixitWorld评估套件：DixitArena评估假设生成（讲故事者）和假设选择（听众）能力；DixitBench隔离听众任务进行控制评估。

Result: 较小开源模型在创造性讲故事方面表现优异，但线索区分度较低；较大专有模型在整体性能特别是听众角色上表现更好。DixitBench与DixitArena听众结果强相关。

Conclusion: 多模态溯因推理中存在生成创造性和判别理解的关键权衡，这是开发更平衡、更强大视觉语言代理的核心挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal abductive reasoning--the generation and selection of explanatory
hypotheses from partial observations--is a cornerstone of intelligence. Current
evaluations of this ability in vision-language models (VLMs) are largely
confined to static, single-agent tasks. Inspired by Dixit, we introduce
DixitWorld, a comprehensive evaluation suite designed to deconstruct this
challenge. DIXITWORLD features two core components: DixitArena, a dynamic,
multi-agent environment that evaluates both hypothesis generation (a
"storyteller" crafting cryptic clues) and hypothesis selection ("listeners"
choosing the target image from decoys) under imperfect information; and
DixitBench, a static QA benchmark that isolates the listener's task for
efficient, controlled evaluation. Results from DixitArena reveal distinct,
role-dependent behaviors: smaller open-source models often excel as creative
storytellers, producing imaginative yet less discriminative clues, whereas
larger proprietary models demonstrate superior overall performance,
particularly as listeners. Performance on DixitBench strongly correlates with
listener results in DixitArena, validating it as a reliable proxy for
hypothesis selection. Our findings reveal a key trade-off between generative
creativity and discriminative understanding in multimodal abductive reasoning,
a central challenge for developing more balanced and capable vision-language
agents.

Conclusion: CharCom适用于故事插图和动画等实际应用，能够以最小开销实现可扩展的多角色生成

Abstract: Ensuring character identity consistency across varying prompts remains a
fundamental limitation in diffusion-based text-to-image generation. We propose
CharCom, a modular and parameter-efficient framework that achieves
character-consistent story illustration through composable LoRA adapters,
enabling efficient per-character customization without retraining the base
model. Built on a frozen diffusion backbone, CharCom dynamically composes
adapters at inference using prompt-aware control. Experiments on multi-scene
narratives demonstrate that CharCom significantly enhances character fidelity,
semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. It remains robust in crowded scenes
and enables scalable multi-character generation with minimal overhead, making
it well-suited for real-world applications such as story illustration and
animation.

TL;DR: PALU是一种性能感知长度更新策略，通过约束优化方法减少大语言模型的推理步骤长度，在保持性能的同时实现简洁推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有简洁推理方法依赖手工启发式规则，难以在简洁性和性能之间取得平衡，且无法跨领域和模型规模适应。

Method: 将简洁推理建模为约束优化问题，应用拉格朗日优化，并通过三个近似简化：离策略性能估计、拉格朗日乘子截断、分位数驱动的长度调整。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B上，PALU将输出长度减少65%，准确率提高15%，在五个基准测试中优于其他方法。

Conclusion: PALU是一种实用有效的简洁推理方法，能够跨领域（逻辑、STEM、数学）和模型规模（1.5B-14B）适应。

Abstract: Concise reasoning in large language models seeks to generate only essential
intermediate steps needed to arrive at a final answer, thereby alleviating
issues of overthinking. Most proposed approaches hinge on carefully
hand-crafted heuristics, struggling to balance concision with performance,
often failing to adapt across domains and model scales. In this work, we
address these challenges by introducing a principled and pragmatic strategy,
performance-aware length updating (PALU). As a principled algorithm, PALU
formulates concise reasoning as a constrained optimization problem, minimizing
response length subject to a performance constraint, and then applies
Lagrangian optimization to convert it into a tractable unconstrained problem.
As a pragmatic solution, PALU streamlines complicated update rules through
three approximations: (i) estimating performance with off-policy rollouts, (ii)
truncating the Lagrange multiplier to two extremes, and (iii) replacing
gradient-based updates with quantile-driven length adjustments. PALU reduces
output length by 65% while improving accuracy by 15% when applied to
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, averaged over five benchmarks, outperforming a
range of alternative methods. Furthermore, PALU is demonstrated to adapt across
both domain (logic, STEM and math) and model scale (1.5B, 7B, 14B) entrenching
the algorithm as a practical and effective concise reasoning approach.

TL;DR: SAFER是一个两阶段风险控制框架，通过弃权感知采样和保形过滤来解决开放域问答中缺乏固定答案空间的问题，提供统计保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有选择性保形预测方法假设所有实例的可接受答案都能通过有限采样获得，这在缺乏固定答案空间的开放域问答场景中不现实。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 在验证集上使用Clopper-Pearson精确方法校准采样预算；2) 应用保形风险控制方法确定统计有效的置信度阈值，过滤不可靠候选答案。

Result: SAFER能够控制正确答案被排除的风险，并与各种任务特定的准入标准和验证-测试分割比例兼容。

Conclusion: SAFER在开放域问答场景中提供了统计保证的风险控制，具有鲁棒性和高数据效率。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in risk-sensitive
applications such as real-world open-ended question answering (QA), ensuring
the trustworthiness of their outputs has become critical. Existing selective
conformal prediction (SCP) methods provide statistical guarantees by
constructing prediction sets with a constrained miscoverage rate for correct
answers. However, prior works unrealistically assume that admissible answers
for all instances can be obtained via finite sampling, even for open-ended QA
scenarios that lack a fixed and finite solution space. To address this, we
introduce a two-stage risk control framework comprising abstention-aware
sampling and conformalized filtering (SAFER). Firstly, on a held-out
calibration set, SAFER calibrates a sampling budget within the maximum sampling
cap, using the Clopper-Pearson exact method at a user-desired risk level (i.e.,
the maximum allowable miscoverage rate of the sampling sets). If the risk level
cannot be satisfied within the cap, we abstain; otherwise, the calibrated
sampling budget becomes the minimum requirements at test time. Then, we employ
calibration instances where correct answers are attainable under the calibrated
budget and apply the conformal risk control method to determine a statistically
valid uncertainty threshold, which filters unreliable distractors from the
candidate set for each test data point. In this stage, SAFER introduces an
additional risk level to guide the calculation of the threshold, thereby
controlling the risk of correct answers being excluded. Furthermore, we show
that SAFER is compatible with various task-specific admission criteria and
calibration-test split ratios, highlighting its robustness and high data
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM代理在复杂工具使用任务中高质量训练数据稀缺的问题，以及SFT导致过拟合、RL存在冷启动和训练不稳定的挑战。

Method: Environment Tuning：通过结构化课程编排学习过程，使用环境增强提供纠正反馈，细粒度进度奖励确保稳定高效探索。

Result: 仅使用BFCL基准的400个问题实例，在分布内性能与强基线竞争，在分布外泛化方面表现更优，避免了SFT方法的性能崩溃。

Conclusion: 从基于静态轨迹的监督微调转向动态、基于环境的探索，为训练更鲁棒和数据高效的代理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents show great promise for complex, multi-turn
tool-use tasks, but their development is often hampered by the extreme scarcity
of high-quality training data. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on synthetic data
leads to overfitting, whereas standard reinforcement learning (RL) struggles
with a critical cold-start problem and training instability. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textbf{Environment Tuning}$, a novel training
paradigm that enables agents to learn complex behaviors directly from problem
instances without relying on pre-collected expert trajectories.
$\textbf{Environment Tuning}$ orchestrates this learning process through a
structured curriculum, actionable environment augmentation that provides
corrective feedback, and fine-grained progress rewards to ensure stable and
efficient exploration. Using only 400 problem instances from Berkeley
Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) benchmark, our method not only achieves
competitive in-distribution performance against strong baselines but also
demonstrates superior out-of-distribution generalization, overcoming the
performance collapse common to SFT-based approaches. Our work presents a
paradigm shift from supervised fine-tuning on static trajectories to dynamic,
environment-based exploration, paving the way for training more robust and
data-efficient agents.

Motivation: 现有激活导向方法依赖粗粒度启发式规则，缺乏对干预位置和强度的原则性指导，需要更可靠的行为控制方法来确保LLM的可信生成。

Method: 提出PIXEL框架：1）从尾平均和末端token双视图学习属性对齐子空间；2）通过约束几何目标选择干预强度；3）样本级正交残差校准；4）轻量级位置扫描识别干预位置。

Result: 在多种模型和评估范式下，PIXEL持续改进属性对齐效果，同时保持模型通用能力，为LLM可控生成提供了实用且原则性的方法。

Conclusion: PIXEL通过位置级自适应激活导向，提供了可靠的对齐方法，支持LLM的可控生成，并提供了最小干预原则的表征级保证。

Abstract: Reliable behavior control is central to deploying large language models
(LLMs) on the web. Activation steering offers a tuning-free route to align
attributes (e.g., truthfulness) that ensure trustworthy generation. Prevailing
approaches rely on coarse heuristics and lack a principled account of where to
steer and how strongly to intervene. To this end, we propose Position-wise
Injection with eXact Estimated Levels (PIXEL), a position-wise activation
steering framework that, in contrast to prior work, learns a property-aligned
subspace from dual views (tail-averaged and end-token) and selects intervention
strength via a constrained geometric objective with a closed-form solution,
thereby adapting to token-level sensitivity without global hyperparameter
tuning. PIXEL further performs sample-level orthogonal residual calibration to
refine the global attribute direction and employs a lightweight
position-scanning routine to identify receptive injection sites. We
additionally provide representation-level guarantees for the
minimal-intervention rule, supporting reliable alignment. Across diverse models
and evaluation paradigms, PIXEL consistently improves attribute alignment while
preserving model general capabilities, offering a practical and principled
method for LLMs' controllable generation. Our code is available at

Motivation: 长推理模型在推理场景中表现出色，但存在计算成本高和推理延迟大的问题，主要由于过度思考导致。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）冷启动阶段使用监督微调构建混合推理数据集；2）强化学习阶段引入熵引导混合策略优化EHPO，在高熵单元进行分支并采用难度感知惩罚来平衡快慢推理。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ADR在保持最先进方法性能的同时，推理输出长度减少49.5%至59.3%，性能提升最高达6.1%。

Conclusion: ADR在推理性能和效率之间实现了有效平衡，显著降低了计算开销和推理延迟。

Abstract: Although Long Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved superior performance on
various reasoning scenarios, they often suffer from increased computational
costs and inference latency caused by overthinking. To address these
limitations, we propose Adaptive Dual Reasoner, which supports two reasoning
modes: fast thinking and slow thinking. ADR dynamically alternates between
these modes based on the contextual complexity during reasoning. ADR is trained
in two stages: (1) A cold-start stage using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to
equip the model with the ability to integrate both fast and slow reasoning
modes, in which we construct a hybrid reasoning dataset through a dedicated
pipeline to provide large-scale supervision. (2) A reinforcement learning stage
for optimizing reasoning effort, where we introduce Entropy-guided Hybrid
Policy Optimization EHPO, an RL training framework employing an entropy-guided
dynamic rollout strategy for branching at high-entropy units and a
difficulty-aware penalty to balance fast and slow reasoning. Across challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ADR achieves an effective balance between
reasoning performance and efficiency among state-of-the-art approaches.
Specifically, ADR yields a performance gain of up to 6.1%, while reducing the
reasoning output length by 49.5% to 59.3%.

Method: 提出基于扰动的因果识别关键神经元方法，系统定位LLMs中的关键神经元。

Result: 发现：(1) LLMs包含超稀疏关键神经元集，破坏这些神经元可使720亿参数模型完全崩溃，困惑度增加20个数量级；(2) 关键神经元非均匀分布，集中在外层MLP down_proj组件；(3) 性能退化呈现急剧相变而非渐进下降。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更鲁棒的模型架构和提高安全关键应用中的部署安全性提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational tools in natural
language processing, powering a wide range of applications and research. Many
studies have shown that LLMs share significant similarities with the human
brain. Recent neuroscience research has found that a small subset of biological
neurons in the human brain are crucial for core cognitive functions, which
raises a fundamental question: do LLMs also contain a small subset of critical
neurons? In this paper, we investigate this question by proposing a
Perturbation-based Causal Identification of Critical Neurons method to
systematically locate such critical neurons in LLMs. Our findings reveal three
key insights: (1) LLMs contain ultra-sparse critical neuron sets. Disrupting
these critical neurons can cause a 72B-parameter model with over 1.1 billion
neurons to completely collapse, with perplexity increasing by up to 20 orders
of magnitude; (2) These critical neurons are not uniformly distributed, but
tend to concentrate in the outer layers, particularly within the MLP down\_proj
components; (3) Performance degradation exhibits sharp phase transitions,
rather than a gradual decline, when these critical neurons are disrupted.
Through comprehensive experiments across diverse model architectures and
scales, we provide deeper analysis of these phenomena and their implications
for LLM robustness and interpretability. These findings can offer guidance for
developing more robust model architectures and improving deployment security in
safety-critical applications.

Conclusion: 该方法完全模型无关，显著提升了现有多模态大模型的可靠性和可解释性，使其能够安全部署在高风险应用中。

Abstract: Multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) are rapidly advancing
vision-language reasoning and are emerging as a foundation for cross-modal
intelligence. Hallucination remains a persistent failure mode, manifesting
itself as erroneous reasoning chains and misinterpretation of visual content.
In this study, we observe that attention heads exhibit a staged division:
shallow heads predominantly serve perception, while deeper heads shift toward
symbolic reasoning, revealing two major causes of hallucination, namely
perceptual bias and reasoning drift. To address these issues, we propose a
lightweight and interpretable two-step plugin, Functional Head Identification
and Class-conditioned Rescaling, which locates perception- and
reasoning-oriented heads and regulates their contributions without retraining.
Evaluations on three real-world MLRMs (Kimi-VL, Ocean-R1, R1-Onevision), six
benchmarks across three domains, and four baselines show that our plugin
achieves an average improvement of 5% and up to 15%, with only <1% additional
computation and 9% of baseline latency. Our approach is completely
model-agnostic and significantly enhances both the reliability and
interpretability of the off-the-shelf MLRMs, thereby enabling their safe
deployment in high-stakes applications. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决Airbnb客服操作的复杂性，通过改进LLMs在客服场景中的理解和执行能力，提升客服效率和质量。

Method: 采用Intent、Context、Action（ICA）格式重构策略和工作流程，开发合成数据生成策略进行低成本模型微调。

Result: 内部实验显示，重构工作流程和合成数据微调显著提升了模型性能，在准确性和处理时间评估指标上都有改善。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅成本效益高，还显著提升了客户支持质量，为LLMs在客服领域的应用设立了新基准。

Abstract: We propose a practical approach by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs)
with a framework designed to navigate the complexities of Airbnb customer
support operations. In this paper, our methodology employs a novel reformatting
technique, the Intent, Context, and Action (ICA) format, which transforms
policies and workflows into a structure more comprehensible to LLMs.
Additionally, we develop a synthetic data generation strategy to create
training data with minimal human intervention, enabling cost-effective
fine-tuning of our model. Our internal experiments (not applied to Airbnb
products) demonstrate that our approach of restructuring workflows and
fine-tuning LLMs with synthetic data significantly enhances their performance,
setting a new benchmark for their application in customer support. Our solution
is not only cost-effective but also improves customer support, as evidenced by
both accuracy and manual processing time evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出"包容性创新红利"概念，论证为多样化、受限使用场景设计的医疗AI解决方案能在更广泛市场中获得更优经济回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然医疗AI公平性的伦理论证已很充分，但包容性设计的经济和战略价值仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出医疗AI包容性创新框架(HAIIF)，这是一个实用的评分系统，帮助组织基于获取包容性创新红利潜力来评估AI投资。

Result: 识别了包容性创新驱动回报的四个机制：市场扩张、风险缓解、性能红利和竞争优势。

Conclusion: 渐进投资包容性设计的组织能实现市场扩张和持续竞争优势，而将其视为成本的组织将面临复合劣势。

Abstract: While ethical arguments for fairness in healthcare AI are well-established,
the economic and strategic value of inclusive design remains underexplored.
This perspective introduces the ``inclusive innovation dividend'' -- the
counterintuitive principle that solutions engineered for diverse, constrained
use cases generate superior economic returns in broader markets. Drawing from
assistive technologies that evolved into billion-dollar mainstream industries,
we demonstrate how inclusive healthcare AI development creates business value
beyond compliance requirements. We identify four mechanisms through which
inclusive innovation drives returns: (1) market expansion via geographic
scalability and trust acceleration; (2) risk mitigation through reduced
remediation costs and litigation exposure; (3) performance dividends from
superior generalization and reduced technical debt, and (4) competitive
advantages in talent acquisition and clinical adoption. We present the
Healthcare AI Inclusive Innovation Framework (HAIIF), a practical scoring
system that enables organizations to evaluate AI investments based on their
potential to capture these benefits. HAIIF provides structured guidance for
resource allocation, transforming fairness and inclusivity from regulatory
checkboxes into sources of strategic differentiation. Our findings suggest that
organizations investing incrementally in inclusive design can achieve expanded
market reach and sustained competitive advantages, while those treating these
considerations as overhead face compounding disadvantages as network effects
and data advantages accrue to early movers.

TL;DR: 该论文发现推理轨迹长度是大型推理模型中一个简单有效的置信度估计器，与口头表达置信度等方法性能相当但互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM的幻觉问题并提高其可靠部署能力，需要有效的置信度估计方法。

Method: 通过跨多个模型、数据集和提示的综合实验，研究推理轨迹长度作为置信度估计器的性能，并分析其机制。

Result: 推理轨迹长度在置信度估计方面表现良好，推理后训练从根本上改变了轨迹长度与准确性的关系，高熵或"分叉"标记在机制中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 推理后训练增强了不确定性量化能力，轨迹长度可作为大型推理模型的实用置信度度量。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for LLMs is a key research direction towards
addressing hallucination and other issues that limit their reliable deployment.
In this work, we show that reasoning trace length is a simple and useful
confidence estimator in large reasoning models. Through comprehensive
experiments across multiple models, datasets, and prompts, we show that trace
length performs in comparable but complementary ways to other zero-shot
confidence estimators such as verbalized confidence. Our work reveals that
reasoning post-training fundamentally alters the relationship between trace
length and accuracy, going beyond prior work that had shown that post-training
causes traces to grow longer in general (e.g., "overthinking"). We investigate
the mechanisms behind trace length's performance as a confidence signal,
observing that the effect remains even after adjusting for confounders such as
problem difficulty and GRPO-induced length bias. We identify high-entropy or
"forking" tokens as playing a key role in the mechanism. Our findings
demonstrate that reasoning post-training enhances uncertainty quantification
beyond verbal expressions, and establish trace length as a practical confidence
measure for large reasoning models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Traj-CoA是一个用于患者轨迹建模的多代理系统，通过链式代理处理电子健康记录数据，使用共享记忆模块EHRMem减少噪声并保存时间线，在零样本肺癌风险预测任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在建模患者轨迹方面具有通用性，但电子健康记录数据长度长、噪声多，在时间推理方面存在挑战。

Method: 使用多代理系统，包括一系列工作代理按顺序处理EHR数据块，将关键事件提取到共享长期记忆模块EHRMem中，最后由管理代理综合所有信息进行预测。

Result: 在基于五年EHR数据的零样本一年期肺癌风险预测任务中，Traj-CoA在四类基线方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: Traj-CoA展现出临床对齐的时间推理能力，是建模复杂患者轨迹的稳健且可推广的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling
patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic
health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges,
we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for
patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to
process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events
into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a
comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents'
summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a
zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR
data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that
Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a
promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient
trajectories.

Motivation: 现有医疗AI系统在处理孤立任务时表现良好，但在整合诊断推理和用药决策的临床工作流程中效果不佳，缺乏临床团队中的交叉验证和知识整合。

Method: 开发了MedCoAct置信感知多智能体框架，集成专业医生和药剂师智能体，并创建DrugCareQA基准来评估医疗AI在整合诊断和治疗工作流程中的能力。

Result: MedCoAct实现了67.58%的诊断准确率和67.58%的用药推荐准确率，分别比单智能体框架提高了7.04%和7.08%。

Conclusion: 这种协作方法在不同医疗领域都能良好泛化，特别适用于远程医疗咨询和常规临床场景，同时提供可解释的决策路径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in isolated medical tasks like diagnosis and image
analysis, but struggle with integrated clinical workflows that connect
diagnostic reasoning and medication decisions. We identify a core limitation:
existing medical AI systems process tasks in isolation without the
cross-validation and knowledge integration found in clinical teams, reducing
their effectiveness in real-world healthcare scenarios. To transform the
isolation paradigm into a collaborative approach, we propose MedCoAct, a
confidence-aware multi-agent framework that simulates clinical collaboration by
integrating specialized doctor and pharmacist agents, and present a benchmark,
DrugCareQA, to evaluate medical AI capabilities in integrated diagnosis and
treatment workflows. Our results demonstrate that MedCoAct achieves 67.58\%
diagnostic accuracy and 67.58\% medication recommendation accuracy,
outperforming single agent framework by 7.04\% and 7.08\% respectively. This
collaborative approach generalizes well across diverse medical domains, proving
especially effective for telemedicine consultations and routine clinical
scenarios, while providing interpretable decision-making pathways.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型通过增加计算资源提升性能，但识别哪些推理路径可能成功是关键机会，可靠预测有效路径可大幅减少计算浪费并提高整体效率。

Method: 引入Latent-Trajectory信号，通过测量推理开始到结束的潜在表征整体变化、中间步骤累积变化以及这些变化向最终状态的推进程度，来预测解决方案准确性。

Result: Latent-Trajectory信号比跨层度量和基于输出的置信度测量更可靠地预测解决方案准确性，在指导多代采样答案选择时，比多数投票更有效高效，减少70%令牌使用同时平均提升2.6%准确率。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了推理时效率的实用策略，还从可解释性角度深入理解推理过程如何在潜在空间中表示和区分，这些预测信号通常在推理轨迹早期出现，支持早期选择和计算资源分配。

Abstract: Reasoning models improve their problem-solving ability through inference-time
scaling, allocating more compute via longer token budgets. Identifying which
reasoning traces are likely to succeed remains a key opportunity: reliably
predicting productive paths can substantially reduce wasted computation and
improve overall efficiency. We introduce Latent-Trajectory signals that
characterize the temporal evolution of a model's internal representations
during the generation of intermediate reasoning tokens. By measuring the
overall change in latent representations between the start and end of
reasoning, the change accumulated across intermediate steps, and the extent to
which these changes advance toward the final state, we show that these signals
predict solution accuracy more reliably than both cross-layer metrics and
output-based confidence measures. When used to guide answer selection across
multiple sampled generations, Latent-Trajectory signals make test-time scaling
more effective and efficient than majority voting, reducing token usage by up
to 70% while preserving and even improving accuracy by 2.6% on average.
Moreover, these predictive signals often emerge early in the reasoning trace,
enabling early selection and allocation of compute to the most promising
candidates. Our findings contribute not only practical strategies for
inference-time efficiency, but also a deeper interpretability perspective on
how reasoning processes are represented and differentiated in latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM对完整学术论文的深度理解能力方面存在不足，要么问题设计肤浅，要么评估指标不可靠。

Method: 通过激励驱动的对抗性标注过程开发ELAIPBench基准，包含137篇论文的403个多选题，涵盖三个难度级别，强调非平凡推理而非浅层检索。

Result: 最佳性能的LLM准确率仅为39.95%，远低于人类表现；配备思考模式或RAG系统的前沿LLM未能改善结果，甚至因过度思考或噪声检索而降低准确率。

Conclusion: 当前LLM能力与对学术论文的真正理解之间存在显著差距。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel at many domain-specific tasks, their
ability to deeply comprehend and reason about full-length academic papers
remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often fall short of capturing such
depth, either due to surface-level question design or unreliable evaluation
metrics. To address this gap, we introduce ELAIPBench, a benchmark curated by
domain experts to evaluate LLMs' comprehension of artificial intelligence (AI)
research papers. Developed through an incentive-driven, adversarial annotation
process, ELAIPBench features 403 multiple-choice questions from 137 papers. It
spans three difficulty levels and emphasizes non-trivial reasoning rather than
shallow retrieval. Our experiments show that the best-performing LLM achieves
an accuracy of only 39.95%, far below human performance. Moreover, we observe
that frontier LLMs equipped with a thinking mode or a retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) system fail to improve final results-even harming accuracy due
to overthinking or noisy retrieval. These findings underscore the significant
gap between current LLM capabilities and genuine comprehension of academic
papers.

Motivation: 现有研究已引入基于方法的推理和范围扩展来提升LLM性能，但缺乏系统整合。本文旨在将这些思想统一起来，更系统地解决间接（未见）问题。

Method: 构建直觉-方法分层模型：直觉层提供快速反应，方法层将问题解耦为可转移推理单元。引入垂直（因果分析）、水平（平行和泛化问题）、时间和空间四种范围扩展，组织成系统知识树并互联为知识网络。

Result: 提出了方法扩展熵作为定量评估指标，衡量扩展的独立性和多样性，以此评估系统解决未见问题的能力。

Conclusion: 通过逻辑连接现有方法与新扩展，并引入基于熵的评估框架，这项工作推进了LLM在现实问题解决中更稳健和可扩展的推理范式。

Abstract: Existing studies have introduced method-based reasoning and scope extension
as approaches to enhance Large Language Model (LLM) performance beyond direct
matrix mappings. Building on these foundations, this paper summarizes and
integrates these ideas into a unified Intuition-Method Layered Model with Scope
Extension, designed to address indirected (unseen) issues more systematically.
In this framework, intuition-based thinking provides rapid first-reaction
answers, while method-based thinking decouples questions and solutions into
transferable reasoning units. Scope extension is then applied to broaden
applicability, including vertical (cause analysis), horizontal (parallel and
generalized issues), and for the first time, temporal and spatial extensions,
which expand reasoning across time and contextual dimensions. These extensions
are organized into systematic knowledge trees that interconnect into a
knowledge network, thereby increasing adaptability. To quantitatively evaluate
this process, we propose the entropy of method extension, which measures the
independence and diversity of extensions as an indicator of the system's
capacity to solve unseen questions. By logically connecting existing approaches
with new extensions and introducing an entropy-based evaluation framework, this
work advances toward a more robust and extensible reasoning paradigm for LLMs
in real-world problem-solving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集是表示有序结构不确定信息的新框架，测量置换质量函数之间的距离是RPS理论中的关键研究课题。

Method: 采用RPS的层-2信念结构解释，从置换出发引入累积Jaccard指数新定义来量化两个置换之间的相似性，并基于累积Jaccard指数矩阵提出RPS的距离度量方法。

Result: 所提方法不仅克服了现有方法的缺点，与Jousselme距离兼容，而且具有更高的敏感性和灵活性。

Conclusion: 提出的基于累积Jaccard指数的距离度量方法在RPS理论中具有重要应用价值，为决策者提供了调整权重和截断深度的参数。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a recently proposed framework designed to
represent order-structured uncertain information. Measuring the distance
between permutation mass functions is a key research topic in RPS theory
(RPST). This paper conducts an in-depth analysis of distances between RPSs from
two different perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and transferable belief
model (TBM). Adopting the layer-2 belief structure interpretation of RPS, we
regard RPST as a refinement of TBM, where the order in the ordered focus set
represents qualitative propensity. Starting from the permutation, we introduce
a new definition of the cumulative Jaccard index to quantify the similarity
between two permutations and further propose a distance measure method for RPSs
based on the cumulative Jaccard index matrix. The metric and structural
properties of the proposed distance measure are investigated, including the
positive definiteness analysis of the cumulative Jaccard index matrix, and a
correction scheme is provided. The proposed method has a natural
top-weightiness property: inconsistencies between higher-ranked elements tend
to result in greater distance values. Two parameters are provided to the
decision-maker to adjust the weight and truncation depth. Several numerical
examples are used to compare the proposed method with the existing method. The
experimental results show that the proposed method not only overcomes the
shortcomings of the existing method and is compatible with the Jousselme
distance, but also has higher sensitivity and flexibility.

Motivation: 解决基于梯度的优化方法对硬件要求严格、需要高并发高内存GPU，且要求所有神经网络操作可微分的问题，使许多有前景的不可微分架构能够实用化。

Method: 使用进化算法优化大语言模型，从预训练阶段开始训练模型。

Result: 成功训练了10亿参数的LLM，提供了关于进化算法如何有效优化神经网络的关键见解。

Conclusion: 该方法有望显著降低大语言模型的训练计算成本，使计算资源有限的群体能够参与深度学习研究。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress,
with model optimization primarily relying on gradient-based optimizers such as
Adam. However, these gradient-based methods impose stringent hardware
requirements, demanding high-concurrency, high-memory GPUs. Moreover, they
require all neural network operations to be differentiable, thereby excluding
many promising non-differentiable architectures from practical use. To address
these limitations, we propose a method for optimizing LLMs using evolutionary
algorithms (EA4LLM) and, for the first time, successfully demonstrate its
capability to train a 1-billion-parameter LLM from the pre-trained stage. We
conduct extensive experiments and provide key insights into how evolutionary
algorithms can effectively optimize neural networks. Our work challenges the
prevailing assumption that gradient-based optimization is the only viable
approach for training neural networks. It also holds significant potential to
reduce the computational cost of training large language models, thereby
enabling groups with limited computational resources to participate in deep
learning research.

Conclusion: 协作式、专业化驱动的架构在推进可靠多模态生成系统方面具有前景

Abstract: Multimodal text-to-image generation remains constrained by the difficulty of
maintaining semantic alignment and professional-level detail across diverse
visual domains. We propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
coordinates domain-specialized agents (e.g., focused on architecture,
portraiture, and landscape imagery) within two coupled subsystems: a text
enhancement module and an image generation module, each augmented with
multimodal integration components. Agents are trained using Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) under a composite reward function that balances semantic
similarity, linguistic visual quality, and content diversity. Cross-modal
alignment is enforced through contrastive learning, bidirectional attention,
and iterative feedback between text and image. Across six experimental
settings, our system significantly enriches generated content (word count
increased by 1614%) while reducing ROUGE-1 scores by 69.7%. Among fusion
methods, Transformer-based strategies achieve the highest composite score
(0.521), despite occasional stability issues. Multimodal ensembles yield
moderate consistency (ranging from 0.444 to 0.481), reflecting the persistent
challenges of cross-modal semantic grounding. These findings underscore the
promise of collaborative, specialization-driven architectures for advancing
reliable multimodal generative systems.

Result: APLR模型提供了最佳拟合效果，识别出时间管理、专注力、帮助同学和线下课程参与是最显著的正向影响因素，而创意活动参与无正面影响。

Conclusion: APLR模型不仅能识别群体层面的影响因素，还能在个体层面进行解释，使教育者能够根据学生特征定制教学指导。

Abstract: Although student learning satisfaction has been widely studied, modern
techniques such as interpretable machine learning and neural networks have not
been sufficiently explored. This study demonstrates that a recent model that
combines boosting with interpretability, automatic piecewise linear
regression(APLR), offers the best fit for predicting learning satisfaction
among several state-of-the-art approaches. Through the analysis of APLR's
numerical and visual interpretations, students' time management and
concentration abilities, perceived helpfulness to classmates, and participation
in offline courses have the most significant positive impact on learning
satisfaction. Surprisingly, involvement in creative activities did not
positively affect learning satisfaction. Moreover, the contributing factors can
be interpreted on an individual level, allowing educators to customize
instructions according to student profiles.

Motivation: 现有方法存在两类问题：强化学习方法数据效率低、对现实动态建模过于简化、难以强制执行操作约束；分解在线优化方法依赖人工设计的高层目标，缺乏对底层路由动态的认知。

Method: 构建动态分层系统，将LLM作为元优化器生成语义启发式，指导负责约束执行和实时决策的底层优化器。通过和声搜索驱动的闭环进化过程，基于优化层的可行性和性能反馈迭代调整LLM提示。

Conclusion: 该混合框架成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过LLM与数学优化的结合，在无需大规模训练数据的情况下实现了更好的供需平衡效果。

Abstract: Online ride-hailing platforms aim to deliver efficient mobility-on-demand
services, often facing challenges in balancing dynamic and spatially
heterogeneous supply and demand. Existing methods typically fall into two
categories: reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, which suffer from data
inefficiency, oversimplified modeling of real-world dynamics, and difficulty
enforcing operational constraints; or decomposed online optimization methods,
which rely on manually designed high-level objectives that lack awareness of
low-level routing dynamics. To address this issue, we propose a novel hybrid
framework that integrates large language model (LLM) with mathematical
optimization in a dynamic hierarchical system: (1) it is training-free,
removing the need for large-scale interaction data as in RL, and (2) it
leverages LLM to bridge cognitive limitations caused by problem decomposition
by adaptively generating high-level objectives. Within this framework, LLM
serves as a meta-optimizer, producing semantic heuristics that guide a
low-level optimizer responsible for constraint enforcement and real-time
decision execution. These heuristics are refined through a closed-loop
evolutionary process, driven by harmony search, which iteratively adapts the
LLM prompts based on feasibility and performance feedback from the optimization
layer. Extensive experiments based on scenarios derived from both the New York
and Chicago taxi datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
achieving an average improvement of 16% compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了UCAS方法，通过利用模型内部不确定性信号来改进信用分配，解决RLVR中粗粒度优势信号的问题，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR算法如GRPO对所有token广播统一优势信号，忽略了推理过程中不确定的高风险决策，导致探索效率低下和熵崩溃问题。

Method: UCAS采用两阶段方法：首先基于模型整体自信度调节响应级优势，然后基于原始logit确定性应用token级惩罚，鼓励探索高不确定性但正确的路径。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准测试中，UCAS显著优于强RLVR基线，包括1.5B和7B模型规模，不仅获得更高奖励，还促进更大推理多样性并成功缓解熵崩溃。

Conclusion: UCAS通过不确定性感知的优势塑造有效平衡了探索与利用的权衡，在增强LLM推理能力方面表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown significant
promise for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, prevailing algorithms like GRPO broadcast a uniform advantage
signal across all tokens in a sequence. This coarse-grained approach overlooks
the pivotal role of uncertain, high-stakes decisions during reasoning, leading
to inefficient exploration and the well-documented problem of entropy collapse.
To address this, we introduce UnCertainty-aware Advantage Shaping (UCAS), a
model-free method that refines credit assignment by leveraging the model's
internal uncertainty signals. UCAS operates in two stages: it first modulates
the response-level advantage using the model's overall self-confidence, and
then applies a token-level penalty based on raw logit certainty. This dual
mechanism encourages exploration of high-uncertainty paths that yield correct
answers while penalizing overconfident yet erroneous reasoning, effectively
balancing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Extensive experiments on five
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that UCAS significantly outperforms
strong RLVR baselines across multiple model scales, including 1.5B and 7B. Our
analysis confirms that UCAS not only achieves higher rewards but also promotes
greater reasoning diversity and successfully mitigates entropy collapse.

Abstract: Generative Agentic AI systems are emerging as a powerful paradigm for
automating complex, multi-step tasks. However, many existing frameworks for
building these systems introduce significant complexity, a steep learning
curve, and substantial boilerplate code, hindering rapid prototyping and
deployment. This paper introduces simpliflow, a lightweight, open-source Python
framework designed to address these challenges. simpliflow enables the rapid
development and orchestration of linear, deterministic agentic workflows
through a declarative, JSON-based configuration. Its modular architecture
decouples agent management, workflow execution, and post-processing, promoting
ease of use and extensibility. By integrating with LiteLLM, it supports over
100 Large Language Models (LLMs) out-of-the-box. We present the architecture,
operational flow, and core features of simpliflow, demonstrating its utility
through diverse use cases ranging from software development simulation to
real-time system interaction. A comparative analysis with prominent frameworks
like LangChain and AutoGen highlights simpliflow's unique position as a tool
optimized for simplicity, control, and speed in deterministic workflow
environments.

TL;DR: OmniVideoBench是一个大规模、严格设计的基准测试，专门评估多模态大语言模型在音视频协同理解方面的能力，重点关注模态互补性和逻辑一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试无法全面评估音频和视觉模态之间的协同推理能力，往往忽视其中一个模态或以逻辑不一致的方式整合它们。

Method: 构建包含1000个高质量问答对的基准测试，每个问答对都有逐步推理轨迹，来自628个多样化视频，涵盖13种精心设计的问题类型。

Result: 多个MLLM在OmniVideoBench上的评估显示模型性能与人类推理之间存在显著差距，开源模型明显落后于闭源模型。

Conclusion: OmniVideoBench将公开发布，以促进具有更强和更通用推理能力的MLLM的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
substantial potential in video understanding. However, existing benchmarks fail
to comprehensively evaluate synergistic reasoning capabilities across audio and
visual modalities, often neglecting either one of the modalities or integrating
them in a logically inconsistent manner. To bridge this gap, we introduce
OmniVideoBench, a large-scale and rigorously designed benchmark dedicated to
assessing synergistic audio-visual understanding, with a strong emphasis on
modality complementarity and logical consistency. Specifically, OmniVideoBench
comprises 1000 high-quality question-answer(QA) pairs, each annotated with
step-by-step reasoning traces, derived from 628 diverse videos ranging from
several seconds to 30 minutes, and manually verified to guarantee complete
correctness and uniqueness. Moreover, OmniVideoBench encompasses 13 carefully
designed question types, covering temporal reasoning, spatial localization,
counting, causal inference, summarization, and beyond, thereby capturing the
essential challenges of video understanding. Evaluation of multiple MLLMs on
OmniVideoBench reveals a pronounced gap between model performance and human
reasoning, with open-source models lagging significantly behind their
closed-source counterparts, underscoring the inherent difficulty of genuine
audio-visual reasoning. We will release OmniVideoBench to foster the
development of MLLMs with stronger and more generalizable reasoning
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理演算基于二元归结，限制了多子句间的推理协同。虽然CSE框架提出了动态多子句推理理论，但其算法实现尚未形式化。

Method: 开发了扩展三角方法（ETM），在三角几何框架中形式化矛盾分离机制，支持灵活的子句交互和动态协同。

Result: ETM作为多个高性能定理证明器的核心算法，在TPTP问题集和CASC竞赛中取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: ETM将矛盾分离范式推进为通用、可扩展且实用的自动推理模型，为逻辑推理和定理证明研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automated deduction lies at the core of Artificial Intelligence (AI),
underpinning theorem proving, formal verification, and logical reasoning.
Despite decades of progress, reconciling deductive completeness with
computational efficiency remains an enduring challenge. Traditional reasoning
calculi, grounded in binary resolution, restrict inference to pairwise clause
interactions and thereby limit deductive synergy among multiple clauses. The
Contradiction Separation Extension (CSE) framework, introduced in 2018,
proposed a dynamic multi-clause reasoning theory that redefined logical
inference as a process of contradiction separation rather than sequential
resolution. While that work established the theoretical foundation, its
algorithmic realization remained unformalized and unpublished. This work
presents the Extended Triangular Method (ETM), a generalized
contradiction-construction algorithm that formalizes and extends the internal
mechanisms of contradiction separation. The ETM unifies multiple
contradiction-building strategies, including the earlier Standard Extension
method, within a triangular geometric framework that supports flexible clause
interaction and dynamic synergy. ETM serves as the algorithmic core of several
high-performance theorem provers, CSE, CSE-E, CSI-E, and CSI-Enig, whose
competitive results in standard first-order benchmarks (TPTP problem sets and
CASC 2018-2015) empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of the
proposed approach. By bridging theoretical abstraction and operational
implementation, ETM advances the contradiction separation paradigm into a
generalized, scalable, and practically competitive model for automated
reasoning, offering new directions for future research in logical inference and
theorem proving.

*Xiangyu Wang,Haocheng Yang,Fengxiang Cheng,Fenrong Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应选择符号语言的方法来提升LLM的逻辑推理性能，通过为不同问题选择最合适的符号语言形式化方法，显著优于单一符号语言或随机选择的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言问题转换为符号语言时，只关注语义相似度，忽略了不同符号语言类型本身对特定逻辑推理问题的适用性差异。

Method: 利用LLM自适应选择最适合的符号语言（一阶逻辑、逻辑编程或布尔可满足性），然后将自然语言问题翻译为选定的符号语言表达式，并使用相应的逻辑求解器得出最终答案。

Result: 在基准测试中，自适应选择方法显著优于单一符号语言翻译和随机选择。在混合数据集上达到96%的准确率，比一阶逻辑翻译的次高准确率提升了25%。

Conclusion: 不同自然语言逻辑推理问题对应不同的最优符号语言形式化方法，自适应选择目标符号语言能显著提升LLM的逻辑推理性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggle with complex logical reasoning.
While previous works achieve remarkable improvements, their performance is
highly dependent on the correctness of translating natural language (NL)
problems into a symbolic language (SL). Though numerous works focusing on
improving this translation accuracy, they only consider the similarity between
the meaning of SL and NL, overlooking another crucial influencing factor, the
selection of the target SL type itself. For example, first-order logic language
specializes in logical reasoning with categorical syllogisms and complex
quantifiers, while Boolean satisfiability formalism excels at representing
constraint satisfaction like partial problems. To our knowledge, this is the
first paper to claim and verify that different NL logical reasoning problem
corresponds to different optimal SL formalization for translation. Based on
this, we propose a methods to improve the logical reasoning performance of LLMs
by adaptively selecting the most suitable SL for each problem prior to
translation. Specifically, we leverage LLMs to select the target SL among
first-order logic, logic programming and Boolean satisfiability and then
translate the problem in NL to target SL expressions as well as employ the
corresponding logical solver to derive the final answer. Experimental results
on benchmarks show that our adaptive selection method significantly outperforms
translating all into single SL and randomly selecting the SL. On a mixed
dataset of these benchmarks, our approach achieves 96% accuracy, which
improving performance by 25% compared to the second highest accuracy from the
first-order logic translation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个框架来评估大语言模型是否具备真正的战略思维能力，发现前沿模型在特定推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为，并展现出元推理能力和新颖的启发式决策规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估大语言模型在均衡策略或推理深度方面的表现，但缺乏对其是否具备真正战略思维能力（包括信念形成、行动评估和基于信念的选择）的系统性研究。

Method: 开发了一个框架来分离信念、评估和选择在静态完全信息博弈中的作用，通过分析模型的显性选择和推理轨迹，并引入无上下文游戏来排除记忆模仿的影响。

Result: 前沿模型在目标推理深度下表现出信念一致的最佳响应行为；在无约束时会自我限制推理深度，并对人类和合成对手形成差异化猜想；在复杂度增加时，显式递归被内部生成的稳定、模型特定的启发式选择规则所取代。

Conclusion: 信念一致性、元推理和新颖启发式形成可以从语言建模目标中共同涌现，为研究人工智能体的战略认知提供了结构化基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.

TL;DR: DRIFT框架通过将非正式数学陈述分解为更小的子组件，改进了LLMs在定理证明中的前提检索能力，显著提升了自动形式化任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于检索的自动形式化方法直接使用非正式陈述查询外部库，但忽略了非正式数学陈述通常复杂且缺乏底层数学概念上下文的问题。

Method: 引入DRIFT框架，将非正式数学陈述分解为更小的子组件，实现针对性的前提检索，并检索说明性定理以帮助模型更有效地使用前提。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DRIFT显著提升了前提检索性能，ProofNet上的F1分数相比DPR基线几乎翻倍，在分布外ConNF基准上也有显著改进。

Conclusion: 数学自动形式化中的检索效果高度依赖于模型特定的知识边界，需要与每个模型能力相适应的自适应检索策略。

Abstract: Automating the formalization of mathematical statements for theorem proving
remains a major challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs struggle to
identify and utilize the prerequisite mathematical knowledge and its
corresponding formal representation in languages like Lean. Current
retrieval-augmented autoformalization methods query external libraries using
the informal statement directly, but overlook a fundamental limitation:
informal mathematical statements are often complex and offer limited context on
the underlying math concepts. To address this, we introduce DRIFT, a novel
framework that enables LLMs to decompose informal mathematical statements into
smaller, more tractable ''sub-components''. This facilitates targeted retrieval
of premises from mathematical libraries such as Mathlib. Additionally, DRIFT
retrieves illustrative theorems to help models use premises more effectively in
formalization tasks. We evaluate DRIFT across diverse benchmarks (ProofNet,
ConNF, and MiniF2F-test) and find that it consistently improves premise
retrieval, nearly doubling the F1 score compared to the DPR baseline on
ProofNet. Notably, DRIFT demonstrates strong performance on the
out-of-distribution ConNF benchmark, with BEq+@10 improvements of 37.14% and
42.25% using GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek-V3.1, respectively. Our analysis shows that
retrieval effectiveness in mathematical autoformalization depends heavily on
model-specific knowledge boundaries, highlighting the need for adaptive
retrieval strategies aligned with each model's capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究具身AI中出现的神经症行为模式，这些行为虽然内部逻辑一致，但与现实环境不匹配，可能影响AI系统的安全性和效率。

Method: 在网格导航系统中识别了多种神经症模式，开发了轻量级在线检测器和可重用的逃逸策略，并提出基于遗传编程的破坏性测试方法来最大化神经症评分。

Result: 识别了12种具体的神经症行为模式，包括犹豫不决、计划混乱、固执循环、瘫痪、过度警觉等，并展示了即使在完全可见的情况下，习得的厌恶成本也会导致持久的恐惧回避。

Conclusion: 局部修复不足够，全局性故障可能仍然存在。需要通过破坏性测试来暴露需要架构级修订而非症状级修补的问题，使用第一/第二/第三定律作为安全延迟、命令合规性和资源效率的工程简写。

Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing neurosis in embodied AI: behaviors
that are internally coherent yet misaligned with reality, arising from
interactions among planning, uncertainty handling, and aversive memory. In a
grid navigation stack we catalogue recurrent modalities including flip-flop,
plan churn, perseveration loops, paralysis and hypervigilance, futile search,
belief incoherence, tie break thrashing, corridor thrashing, optimality
compulsion, metric mismatch, policy oscillation, and limited-visibility
variants. For each we give lightweight online detectors and reusable escape
policies (short commitments, a margin to switch, smoothing, principled
arbitration). We then show that durable phobic avoidance can persist even under
full visibility when learned aversive costs dominate local choice, producing
long detours despite globally safe routes. Using First/Second/Third Law as
engineering shorthand for safety latency, command compliance, and resource
efficiency, we argue that local fixes are insufficient; global failures can
remain. To surface them, we propose genetic-programming based destructive
testing that evolves worlds and perturbations to maximize law pressure and
neurosis scores, yielding adversarial curricula and counterfactual traces that
expose where architectural revision, not merely symptom-level patches, is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MAC协议需要手动配置，而基于深度强化学习的协议虽然能提升性能，但泛化性和适应性差，需要昂贵的重新训练来适应动态环境。

Method: 将上行传输建模为动态多跟随者Stackelberg博弈，使用LLM驱动的智能体通过近端策略优化协调，结合协议动作语法确保过程可靠高效。

Result: 仿真显示该框架比传统基线方法吞吐量提升77.6%，公平性改善65.2%，且能很好地适应波动的用户数量而无需重新训练或架构修改。

Conclusion: 该LLM赋能的博弈论MARL框架能够自动生成语义MAC协议，显著提升网络性能并具备优秀的泛化能力，解决了传统DRL方法的适应性限制。

Abstract: Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to
dynamic environments. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater
throughput and a 65.2% fairness improvement over conventional baselines.
Besides, our framework generalizes excellently to a fluctuating number of users
without requiring retraining or architectural changes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有工作主要局限于单篇论文内的工具无关任务，缺乏在真实研究场景中进行跨论文推理和多工具协调的基准测试。

Method: 提出PaperArena评估基准，为智能体提供模块化可扩展平台，包含多模态解析、上下文检索和程序化计算等工具，支持标准化评估。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使最先进的LLM驱动的最成熟智能体系统，平均准确率仅为38.78%，在困难子集上准确率降至18.47%，表明有巨大改进空间。

Conclusion: PaperArena揭示了当前智能体在科学发现任务中的局限性，特别是工具使用效率低下，邀请社区采用该基准来开发更强大的科学发现智能体。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning on the web-scale scientific literature is a
crucial touchstone for large language model (LLM) based agents designed to
support complex knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing works are mainly
restricted to tool-free tasks within isolated papers, largely due to the lack
of a benchmark for cross-paper reasoning and multi-tool orchestration in real
research scenarios. In this work, we propose PaperArena, an evaluation
benchmark for agents to address real-world research questions that typically
require integrating information across multiple papers with the assistance of
external tools. Given a research question, agents should integrate diverse
formats across multiple papers through reasoning and interacting with
appropriate tools, thereby producing a well-grounded answer. To support
standardized evaluation, we provide a modular and extensible platform for agent
execution, offering tools such as multimodal parsing, context retrieval, and
programmatic computation. Experimental results reveal that even the most
advanced LLM powering a well-established agent system achieves merely 38.78%
average accuracy. On the hard subset, accuracy drops to only 18.47%,
highlighting great potential for improvement. We also present several empirical
findings, including that all agents tested exhibit inefficient tool usage,
often invoking more tools than necessary to solve a task. We invite the
community to adopt PaperArena to develop and evaluate more capable agents for
scientific discovery. Our code and data are available

TL;DR: 提出Proof-of-Use (PoU)框架，解决RAG代理中的工具调用黑客问题，通过证据基础的强化学习确保检索证据与答案之间的因果联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习训练的RAG代理存在工具调用黑客问题，即代理通过表面正确的工具调用来增加奖励信号，但没有真正利用检索到的证据，导致模式崩溃和虚假基础。

Method: PoU框架通过统一的逐步合约实现，包括语法引用验证、基于扰动的敏感性奖励和答案-证据对齐目标，确保工具使用的可解释性和功能基础。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，PoU在事实准确性、证据忠实度和工具路由平衡方面持续优于DeepResearch基线，涵盖领域内、领域外和工具分布外设置。

Conclusion: 研究表明，需要将强化学习训练的代理不仅基于任务结果，还要基于检索信息的因果使用，为可信赖的检索增强推理提供了原则性路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agents, such as recent
DeepResearch-style systems, extend large language models (LLMs) with autonomous
information-seeking capabilities through external tools. While reinforcement
learning (RL) has enabled impressive multi-step reasoning, we identify a
previously overlooked failure mode, Tool-Call Hacking, where agents inflate
reward signals by issuing superficially correct tool calls without genuinely
leveraging the retrieved evidence. This results in (i) mode collapse into
repetitive reliance on a single source and (ii) spurious grounding, where
answers are only weakly supported by cited content.
  To address this, we propose Proof-of-Use (PoU), an evidence-grounded RL
framework that enforces verifiable causal links between retrieved evidence,
reasoning traces, and final answers. PoU operationalizes this through a unified
step-wise contract combining syntactic citation validation, perturbation-based
sensitivity rewards, and answer-evidence alignment objectives, ensuring that
tool usage remains both interpretable and functionally grounded.
  Across seven QA benchmarks spanning in-domain, out-of-domain, and
out-of-tool-distribution settings, PoU consistently outperforms strong
DeepResearch baselines in factual accuracy, evidence faithfulness, and
tool-routing balance. These findings highlight the necessity of grounding
RL-trained agents not merely in task outcomes but in the causal use of
retrieved information, offering a principled path toward trustworthy
retrieval-augmented reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架通过图构建、混合推理和交互式可视化，为企业环境提供了可扩展、可解释和以用户为中心的智能知识助手基础。

Abstract: Modern enterprises manage vast knowledge distributed across heterogeneous
systems such as Jira, Git repositories, Confluence, and wikis. Conventional
retrieval methods based on keyword search or static embeddings often fail to
answer complex queries that require contextual reasoning and multi-hop
inference across artifacts. We present a modular hybrid retrieval framework for
adaptive enterprise information access that integrates Knowledge Base
Language-Augmented Models (KBLam), DeepGraph representations, and
embedding-driven semantic search. The framework builds a unified knowledge
graph from parsed repositories including code, pull requests, and commit
histories, enabling semantic similarity search, structural inference, and
multi-hop reasoning. Query analysis dynamically determines the optimal
retrieval strategy, supporting both structured and unstructured data sources
through independent or fused processing. An interactive interface provides
graph visualizations, subgraph exploration, and context-aware query routing to
generate concise and explainable answers. Experiments on large-scale Git
repositories show that the unified reasoning layer improves answer relevance by
up to 80 percent compared with standalone GPT-based retrieval pipelines. By
combining graph construction, hybrid reasoning, and interactive visualization,
the proposed framework offers a scalable, explainable, and user-centric
foundation for intelligent knowledge assistants in enterprise environments.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在语义理解方面表现出色，但在精确时空理解方面存在不足，特别是忽略了视频中的物理信息（如多物体布局和运动），这限制了在需要高精度的下游应用（如具身智能和VR）中的使用。

Method: 提出基于图的强化学习方法Video-STR，采用可验证奖励的强化学习和图基群相对策略优化机制，引导模型在思考过程中推断场景的底层时空拓扑结构。

Conclusion: Video-STR通过图强化学习方法有效提升了多模态大语言模型的精确时空推理能力，构建的STV-205k数据集为模型训练提供了重要支持，代码、模型和数据将公开发布。

Abstract: Recent progress in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has demonstrated
strong semantic understanding capabilities, but struggles to perform precise
spatio-temporal understanding. Existing spatio-temporal methods primarily focus
on the video itself, while overlooking the physical information within the
video, such as multi-object layouts and motion. Such limitations restrict the
use of MLLMs in downstream applications that demand high precision, including
embodied intelligence and VR. To address this issue, we present Video-STR, a
novel graph-based reinforcement method for precise Video Spatio-Temporal
Reasoning. Building upon the capacity of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Reward (RLVR) to improve model abilities, we introduce a reasoning mechanism
using graph-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) method to guide the
model in inferring the underlying spatio-temporal topology of scenarios during
the thinking process. To resolve the lack of spatio-temporal training data, we
construct the STV-205k dataset with 205k question-answering pairs, covering
dynamic multi-object scenes in both indoor and outdoor environments, to support
the model training. Experiments show that Video-STR achieves state-of-the-art
results on various benchmarks, outperforming the base model by 13% on
STI-Bench, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach and dataset.

Abstract: Model merging, typically on Instruct and Thinking models, has shown
remarkable performance for efficient reasoning. In this paper, we
systematically revisit the simplest merging method that interpolates two
weights directly. Particularly, we observe that model interpolation follows a
three-stage evolutionary paradigm with distinct behaviors on the reasoning
trajectory. These dynamics provide a principled guide for navigating the
performance-cost trade-off. Empirical results demonstrate that a strategically
interpolated model surprisingly surpasses sophisticated model merging baselines
on both efficiency and effectiveness. We further validate our findings with
extensive ablation studies on model layers, modules, and decoding strategies.
Ultimately, this work demystifies model interpolation and offers a practical
framework for crafting models with precisely targeted reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于诊断知识本体和FBS模型的维护记录积累方法，用于制造系统中故障原因推断，在专家候选原因集匹配方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制造系统中识别故障原因对维持和提高生产效率至关重要，需要知识库明确结构化系统知识和故障知识，并包含足够长的故障因果链。

Method: 构建诊断知识本体，提出基于功能-行为-结构(FBS)模型的维护记录积累方法。

Result: 使用该方法积累的维护记录进行故障原因推断，与专家枚举的候选原因集匹配度更好，特别是在相关案例少、词汇差异大的困难情况下。

Conclusion: 该方法利用设计阶段对目标系统的理解和知识，支持维护阶段的知识积累和问题解决，有望成为未来整个工程链知识共享的基础。

Abstract: In manufacturing systems, identifying the causes of failures is crucial for
maintaining and improving production efficiency. In knowledge-based
failure-cause inference, it is important that the knowledge base (1) explicitly
structures knowledge about the target system and about failures, and (2)
contains sufficiently long causal chains of failures. In this study, we
constructed Diagnostic Knowledge Ontology and proposed a
Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) model-based maintenance-record accumulation
method based on it. Failure-cause inference using the maintenance records
accumulated by the proposed method showed better agreement with the set of
candidate causes enumerated by experts, especially in difficult cases where the
number of related cases is small and the vocabulary used differs. In the
future, it will be necessary to develop inference methods tailored to these
maintenance records, build a user interface, and carry out validation on larger
and more diverse systems. Additionally, this approach leverages the
understanding and knowledge of the target in the design phase to support
knowledge accumulation and problem solving during the maintenance phase, and it
is expected to become a foundation for knowledge sharing across the entire
engineering chain in the future.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在AI系统应用于法律领域时，如何通过计算论证模型提供符合法律要求的解释，以解决AI黑盒问题，并确保符合GDPR和AIA等法规要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统在法律环境中的不透明性（黑盒问题）对公平性、问责制和信任构成挑战，需要开发能够提供有意义解释的方法来增强透明度。

Method: 采用计算论证模型，分析不同解释策略（基于示例、规则、混合和论证的方法）的优缺点，特别关注论证框架在法律推理中的适用性。

Result: 论证框架能够捕捉法律的可废止性、可争议性和价值敏感性，为可解释法律AI提供了稳健基础，比其他解释方法更符合法律推理的特点。

Conclusion: 计算论证方法最能满足法律领域透明度的技术和规范要求，但仍需解决偏见缓解、司法环境实证验证和合规性等开放挑战。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly deployed in legal
contexts, where their opacity raises significant challenges for fairness,
accountability, and trust. The so-called ``black box problem'' undermines the
legitimacy of automated decision-making, as affected individuals often lack
access to meaningful explanations. In response, the field of Explainable AI
(XAI) has proposed a variety of methods to enhance transparency, ranging from
example-based and rule-based techniques to hybrid and argumentation-based
approaches. This paper promotes computational models of arguments and their
role in providing legally relevant explanations, with particular attention to
their alignment with emerging regulatory frameworks such as the EU General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA). We
analyze the strengths and limitations of different explanation strategies,
evaluate their applicability to legal reasoning, and highlight how
argumentation frameworks -- by capturing the defeasible, contestable, and
value-sensitive nature of law -- offer a particularly robust foundation for
explainable legal AI. Finally, we identify open challenges and research
directions, including bias mitigation, empirical validation in judicial
settings, and compliance with evolving ethical and legal standards, arguing
that computational argumentation is best positioned to meet both technical and
normative requirements of transparency in the law domain.

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) technology,
socio-economic systems are entering a new stage of "human-AI co-creation."
Building upon a previously established multi-level intelligent agent economic
model, this paper conducts simulation-based comparisons of macroeconomic output
evolution in China and the United States under different mechanisms-AI
collaboration, network effects, and AI autonomous production. The results show
that: (1) when AI functions as an independent productive entity, the overall
growth rate of social output far exceeds that of traditional human-labor-based
models; (2) China demonstrates clear potential for acceleration in both the
expansion of intelligent agent populations and the pace of technological
catch-up, offering the possibility of achieving technological convergence or
even partial surpassing. This study provides a systematic, model-based
analytical framework for understanding AI-driven production system
transformation and shifts in international competitiveness, as well as
quantitative insights for relevant policy formulation.

Abstract: The steady growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has accelerated in the
recent years, facilitated by the development of sophisticated models such as
large language models and foundation models. Ensuring robust and reliable power
infrastructures is fundamental to take advantage of the full potential of AI.
However, AI data centres are extremely hungry for power, putting the problem of
their power management in the spotlight, especially with respect to their
impact on environment and sustainable development. In this work, we investigate
the capacity and limits of solutions based on an innovative approach for the
power management of AI data centres, i.e., making part of the input power as
dynamic as the power used for data-computing functions. The performance of
passive and active devices are quantified and compared in terms of
computational gain, energy efficiency, reduction of capital expenditure, and
management costs by analysing power trends from multiple data platforms
worldwide. This strategy, which identifies a paradigm shift in the AI data
centre power management, has the potential to strongly improve the
sustainability of AI hyperscalers, enhancing their footprint on environmental,
financial, and societal fields.

TL;DR: ARIA是一个基于规范驱动的自动化研究智能助手，通过自然语言规范实现可解释的数据分析，整合人类推理与机器执行，提高科学发现的透明度和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学数据的快速增长导致分析能力与研究意图之间存在差距，现有AI分析工具要么偏向自动化而牺牲透明度，要么依赖手动脚本阻碍可扩展性和可重复性。

Method: ARIA采用六层互操作架构（命令、上下文、代码、数据、编排和AI模块），在文档中心化工作流中统一人类推理和机器执行，通过自然语言规范自主生成可执行代码、验证计算并生成透明文档。

Result: 在波士顿房价案例中，ARIA发现了25个关键特征并确定XGBoost为最佳模型（R平方=0.93），过拟合最小。跨领域评估显示ARIA在性能、可解释性和效率方面优于现有系统。

Conclusion: ARIA通过将AI研究原则与科学原则结合在规范驱动架构中，为透明、协作和可重复的科学发现建立了新范式。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of scientific data has widened the gap between analytical
capability and research intent. Existing AI-based analysis tools, ranging from
AutoML frameworks to agentic research assistants, either favor automation over
transparency or depend on manual scripting that hinders scalability and
reproducibility. We present ARIA (Automated Research Intelligence Assistant), a
spec-driven, human-in-the-loop framework for automated and interpretable data
analysis. ARIA integrates six interoperable layers, namely Command, Context,
Code, Data, Orchestration, and AI Module, within a document-centric workflow
that unifies human reasoning and machine execution. Through natural-language
specifications, researchers define analytical goals while ARIA autonomously
generates executable code, validates computations, and produces transparent
documentation. Beyond achieving high predictive accuracy, ARIA can rapidly
identify optimal feature sets and select suitable models, minimizing redundant
tuning and repetitive experimentation. In the Boston Housing case, ARIA
discovered 25 key features and determined XGBoost as the best performing model
(R square = 0.93) with minimal overfitting. Evaluations across heterogeneous
domains demonstrate ARIA's strong performance, interpretability, and efficiency
compared with state-of-the-art systems. By combining AI for research and AI for
science principles within a spec-driven architecture, ARIA establishes a new
paradigm for transparent, collaborative, and reproducible scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了How2框架，使AI智能体能够提出如何做的问题、存储答案并在交互环境中重复使用，以支持终身学习和规划能力提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能体在规划问题中需要回答如何做的问题来减少不确定性并填补知识空白，但这类问题的开放性使得AI智能体难以有效提问，AI专家也难以以支持高效规划的方式回答。

Method: 引入How2记忆智能体框架，在Minecraft制作环境中评估，使用不同抽象级别的教师模型回答问题，从可执行动作序列到高级子目标描述。

Result: 终身学习智能体从与当前状态解耦的抽象答案中获益最大，How2为基于LLM的智能体提供了在交互环境中通过提问来提升规划能力的方法。

Conclusion: How2框架通过使智能体能够提问、存储和重用如何做问题的答案，有效支持了在交互环境中的终身学习和规划能力提升。

Abstract: An agent facing a planning problem can use answers to how-to questions to
reduce uncertainty and fill knowledge gaps, helping it solve both current and
future tasks. However, their open ended nature, where valid answers to "How do
I X?" range from executable actions to high-level descriptions of X's
sub-goals, makes them challenging for AI agents to ask, and for AI experts to
answer, in ways that support efficient planning. We introduce $How^{2}$, a
memory agent framework that enables agents to ask how-to questions, store the
answers, and reuse them for lifelong learning in interactive environments. We
evaluate our approach in Plancraft, a Minecraft crafting environment, where
agents must complete an assembly task by manipulating inventory items. Using
teacher models that answer at varying levels of abstraction, from executable
action sequences to high-level subgoal descriptions, we show that lifelong
learning agents benefit most from answers that are abstracted and decoupled
from the current state. $How^{2}$ offers a way for LLM-based agents to improve
their planning capabilities over time by asking questions in interactive
environments.

*Peiming Li,Zhiyuan Hu,Yang Tang,Shiyu Li,Xi Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了批判驱动推理对齐(CDRA)方法，将LLM对齐从标量奖励匹配重构为结构化推理过程，通过DeepPref基准和Pers-GenPRM模型解决用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM个性化对齐方法存在双重挑战：无法推断用户的深层隐含偏好（包括未陈述的目标、语义上下文和风险容忍度），以及缺乏应对现实世界模糊性的防御性推理能力，导致响应表面化、脆弱和短视。

Method: 1. 引入DeepPref基准数据集，包含20个主题的3000个偏好-查询对，通过模拟多面认知委员会生成带批判注释的推理链；2. 提出个性化生成过程奖励模型(Pers-GenPRM)，将奖励建模重构为个性化推理任务；3. 使用批判驱动策略对齐进行过程级在线强化学习。

Result: 实验证明CDRA在发现和与用户真实偏好对齐方面表现出色，同时执行稳健的推理。

Conclusion: CDRA通过将对齐重构为结构化推理过程，有效解决了用户深层偏好推断和防御性推理的挑战，为LLM个性化对齐提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our
code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Zephyrian-Hugh/Deep-pref.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 每个AI对齐技术都有失效模式，防御纵深策略依赖于不同技术失效模式的不相关性，但当前缺乏对技术间失效模式重叠程度的系统性分析

Method: 选择7种代表性对齐技术和7种失效模式，分析它们之间的重叠程度和相关性

Result: 发现不同对齐技术的失效模式存在不同程度的重叠，有些技术组合提供更好的冗余保护，而其他组合则存在高度相关的失效风险

Conclusion: 防御纵深策略的有效性取决于技术间失效模式的不相关性，研究结果为评估当前风险水平和确定AI对齐研究优先级提供了重要依据

Abstract: AI alignment research aims to develop techniques to ensure that AI systems do
not cause harm. However, every alignment technique has failure modes, which are
conditions in which there is a non-negligible chance that the technique fails
to provide safety. As a strategy for risk mitigation, the AI safety community
has increasingly adopted a defense-in-depth framework: Conceding that there is
no single technique which guarantees safety, defense-in-depth consists in
having multiple redundant protections against safety failure, such that safety
can be maintained even if some protections fail. However, the success of
defense-in-depth depends on how (un)correlated failure modes are across
alignment techniques. For example, if all techniques had the exact same failure
modes, the defense-in-depth approach would provide no additional protection at
all. In this paper, we analyze 7 representative alignment techniques and 7
failure modes to understand the extent to which they overlap. We then discuss
our results' implications for understanding the current level of risk and how
to prioritize AI alignment research in the future.

Motivation: 解决智能代理在执行自然语言长流程程序时的漂移和失败问题，传统LLM驱动的方法因文本变异性大和缺乏结构而难以可靠执行。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Teach阶段将程序文本结构化并丰富可执行逻辑，Execute阶段根据实时输入和环境反馈进行动态执行，使用图表示捕获任务依赖、决策点和可重用子程序。

Result: 在ALFWorld和ScienceWorld等四个基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明基于图的程序表示能提供强大的中间抽象层。

Conclusion: 图表示为可靠代理驱动自动化提供了重要结构基础，能减少长流程推理中的错误累积，实现稳健和可泛化的执行。

Abstract: Learning to autonomously execute long-horizon procedures from natural
language remains a core challenge for intelligent agents. Free-form
instructions such as recipes, scientific protocols, or business workflows
encode rich procedural knowledge, but their variability and lack of structure
cause agents driven by large language models (LLMs) to drift or fail during
execution. We introduce Procedure Aware DynaMic Execution (PADME), an agent
framework that produces and exploits a graph-based representation of
procedures. Unlike prior work that relies on manual graph construction or
unstructured reasoning, PADME autonomously transforms procedural text into
executable graphs that capture task dependencies, decision points, and reusable
subroutines. Central to PADME is a two-phase methodology; Teach phase, which
focuses on systematic structuring, enrichment with executable logic of
procedures, followed by Execute phase, which enables dynamic execution in
response to real-time inputs and environment feedback. This separation ensures
quality assurance and scalability, allowing expert knowledge to be encoded once
and reliably reused across varying contexts. The graph representation also
provides an inductive bias that reduces error accumulation in long-horizon
reasoning, underscoring the importance of structured procedure modeling for
reliable agent-driven automation. Empirically, PADME achieves state-of-the-art
performance on four diverse benchmarks, including ALFWorld and ScienceWorld.
These results demonstrate that agents equipped with graph-based procedure
representations offer a powerful intermediate abstraction for robust and
generalizable execution.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous "experience-reflection-optimization"
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping
stone from the "Era of Experience" to the "Era of Simulation" by generating
high-fidelity behavioral and interaction data.

Abstract: This paper investigates automated skill decomposition using Large Language
Models (LLMs) and proposes a rigorous, ontology-grounded evaluation framework.
Our framework standardizes the pipeline from prompting and generation to
normalization and alignment with ontology nodes. To evaluate outputs, we
introduce two metrics: a semantic F1-score that uses optimal embedding-based
matching to assess content accuracy, and a hierarchy-aware F1-score that
credits structurally correct placements to assess granularity. We conduct
experiments on ROME-ESCO-DecompSkill, a curated subset of parents, comparing
two prompting strategies: zero-shot and leakage-safe few-shot with exemplars.
Across diverse LLMs, zero-shot offers a strong baseline, while few-shot
consistently stabilizes phrasing and granularity and improves hierarchy-aware
alignment. A latency analysis further shows that exemplar-guided prompts are
competitive - and sometimes faster - than unguided zero-shot due to more
schema-compliant completions. Together, the framework, benchmark, and metrics
provide a reproducible foundation for developing ontology-faithful skill
decomposition systems.

TL;DR: 提出维度级奖励模型(DRM)，通过置信度、相关性和连贯性三个维度评估推理过程质量，弥补了结果监督强化学习和过程级奖励模型的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在缺陷：结果监督RL只奖励正确答案但会传播错误推理，过程级奖励模型缺乏泛化性和可解释性且需要任务特定的过程分割。

Method: 提出DRM框架，从三个基本维度评估推理过程：置信度（不确定性校准）、相关性（语义对齐）、连贯性（逻辑一致性），无需真实答案即可进行可解释评估。

Result: 实验表明DRM提供有效的监督信号，指导LLM优化并增强推理能力。在数学、问答、代码执行和谜题等任务上，DRM监督训练在分布内和分布外任务均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 多维度的推理过程监督可以提升LLM在训练分布之外的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Improving the multi-step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a critical yet challenging task. The dominant paradigm, outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RLVR), rewards only correct final answers, often
propagating flawed reasoning and suffering from sparse reward signals. While
process-level reward models (PRMs) provide denser, step-by-step feedback, they
lack generalizability and interpretability, requiring task-specific
segmentation of the reasoning process. To this end, we propose the
Dimension-level Reward Model (DRM), a new supervision framework that bridges
the gap between these two approaches. DRM evaluates the quality of a reasoning
process along three fundamental, complementary, and interpretable dimensions:
Confidence for uncertainty calibration, Relevance for semantic alignment, and
Coherence for logical consistency. Together, these dimensions capture aspects
beyond final answer correctness and enable interpretable assessment without
requiring ground truth answers. Experimental results show that DRM provides
effective supervision signals, guides the optimization of LLMs and enhances
their reasoning ability. In particular, DRM-supervised training achieves
consistent gains on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution open-domain
tasks, including mathematics, question answering, code execution, and puzzles.
Our findings demonstrate that multidimensional supervision of the reasoning
process can improve the generalized reasoning ability of LLMs beyond the
training distribution.

retrieving entities that satisfy a complex logical query, while abductive
reasoning generates plausible logical hypotheses from observations. Despite
their clear synergistic potential, where deduction can validate hypotheses and
abduction can uncover deeper logical patterns, existing methods address them in
isolation. To bridge this gap, we propose DARK, a unified framework for
Deductive and Abductive Reasoning in Knowledge graphs. As a masked diffusion
model capable of capturing the bidirectional relationship between queries and
conclusions, DARK has two key innovations. First, to better leverage deduction
for hypothesis refinement during abductive reasoning, we introduce a
self-reflective denoising process that iteratively generates and validates
candidate hypotheses against the observed conclusion. Second, to discover
richer logical associations, we propose a logic-exploration reinforcement
learning approach that simultaneously masks queries and conclusions, enabling
the model to explore novel reasoning compositions. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DARK achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both deductive and abductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating the
significant benefits of our unified approach.

Abstract: Governance of data, compliance, and business privacy matters, particularly
for healthcare and finance businesses. Since the recent emergence of AI
enterprise AI assistants enhancing business productivity, safeguarding private
data and compliance is now a priority. With the implementation of AI assistants
across the enterprise, the zero data retention can be achieved by implementing
zero data retention policies by Large Language Model businesses like Open AI
and Anthropic and Meta. In this work, we explore zero data retention policies
for the Enterprise apps of large language models (LLMs). Our key contribution
is defining the architectural, compliance, and usability trade-offs of such
systems in parallel. In this research work, we examine the development of
commercial AI assistants with two industry leaders and market titans in this
arena - Salesforce and Microsoft. Both of these companies used distinct
technical architecture to support zero data retention policies. Salesforce
AgentForce and Microsoft Copilot are among the leading AI assistants providing
much-needed push to business productivity in customer care. The purpose of this
paper is to analyze the technical architecture and deployment of zero data
retention policy by consuming applications as well as big language models
service providers like Open Ai, Anthropic, and Meta.

TL;DR: 提出了CC-Gen基准生成器和CAP-CPT方法，用于解决LLM智能体系统中政策文档内部化问题，通过可控复杂度评估和政策分类持续预训练，显著提升性能并减少提示长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体系统依赖政策文档，但文档扩展导致计算开销增加，需要将政策文档嵌入模型先验中，同时保持性能。现有提示压缩方法针对通用提示，但智能体政策文档复杂度更高，内部化更困难。

Method: 引入CC-Gen基准生成器，提供四个可控复杂度级别；提出CAP-CPT方法，自动解析政策文档，提取关键规范并分类为事实性、行为性和条件性三类，通过自回归预训练损失实现政策内部化。

Result: CAP-CPT在所有设置中均优于SFT基线，在Qwen-3-32B上提升达41%和22%，在CC-Gen上实现97.3%的提示长度减少，并在tau-Bench上使用少量SFT数据进一步改进。

Conclusion: 复杂政策规范对推理构成主要挑战，CAP-CPT通过针对性数据合成和分类感知预训练有效减轻数据和推理负担，显著提升政策内部化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agentic systems rely on in-context policy
documents encoding diverse business rules. As requirements grow, these
documents expand rapidly, causing high computational overhead. This motivates
developing internalization methods that embed policy documents into model
priors while preserving performance. Prior prompt compression work targets
generic prompts, but agentic policy documents span multiple complexity levels
and require deeper reasoning, making internalization harder. We introduce
CC-Gen, an agentic benchmark generator with Controllable Complexity across four
levels, enabling systematic evaluation of agents' ability to handle complexity
and offering a unified framework for assessing policy internalization. Our
analysis shows that complex policy specifications governing workflows pose
major reasoning challenges. Supporting internalization with gold user agent
interaction trajectories containing chain-of-thought (CoT) annotations via
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is data-intensive and degrades sharply as policy
complexity increases. To mitigate data and reasoning burdens, we propose
Category-Aware Policy Continued Pretraining (CAP-CPT). Our automated pipeline
parses policy documents to extract key specifications, grouping them into
factual, behavioral, and conditional categories, and isolating complex
conditions that drive workflow complexity. This guides targeted data synthesis
and enables agents to internalize policy information through an autoregressive
pretraining loss. Experiments show CAP-CPT improves SFT baselines in all
settings, with up to 41% and 22% gains on Qwen-3-32B, achieving 97.3% prompt
length reduction on CC-Gen and further enhancing tau-Bench with minimal SFT
data.

Result: 论文分析了AI研究中的再现性危机，并提出了具体的解决方案框架来支持有效的AI治理。

Abstract: AI policymakers are responsible for delivering effective governance
mechanisms that can provide safe, aligned and trustworthy AI development.
However, the information environment offered to policymakers is characterised
by an unnecessarily low Signal-To-Noise Ratio, favouring regulatory capture and
creating deep uncertainty and divides on which risks should be prioritised from
a governance perspective. We posit that the current publication speeds in AI
combined with the lack of strong scientific standards, via weak reproducibility
protocols, effectively erodes the power of policymakers to enact meaningful
policy and governance protocols. Our paper outlines how AI research could adopt
stricter reproducibility guidelines to assist governance endeavours and improve
consensus on the AI risk landscape. We evaluate the forthcoming reproducibility
crisis within AI research through the lens of crises in other scientific
domains; providing a commentary on how adopting preregistration, increased
statistical power and negative result publication reproducibility protocols can
enable effective AI governance. While we maintain that AI governance must be
reactive due to AI's significant societal implications we argue that
policymakers and governments must consider reproducibility protocols as a core
tool in the governance arsenal and demand higher standards for AI research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流失模型多为黑箱，缺乏对流失原因、干预时机和高风险客户群体的洞察，需要转向基于可解释证据的个性化保留策略。

Method: 集成可解释AI量化特征贡献、生存分析建模流失时间风险、RFM分析按交易行为细分客户的三组件框架。

Result: 能够归因流失驱动因素、估计干预窗口、优先处理目标细分群体，支持降低流失率和增强客户忠诚度的策略。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合多种分析方法，为制定有效的客户保留策略提供了全面支持，超越了单纯预测的局限。

Abstract: In online retail, customer acquisition typically incurs higher costs than
customer retention, motivating firms to invest in churn analytics. However,
many contemporary churn models operate as opaque black boxes, limiting insight
into the determinants of attrition, the timing of retention opportunities, and
the identification of high-risk customer segments. Accordingly, the emphasis
should shift from prediction alone to the design of personalized retention
strategies grounded in interpretable evidence. This study advances a
three-component framework that integrates explainable AI to quantify feature
contributions, survival analysis to model time-to-event churn risk, and RFM
profiling to segment customers by transactional behaviour. In combination,
these methods enable the attribution of churn drivers, estimation of
intervention windows, and prioritization of segments for targeted actions,
thereby supporting strategies that reduce attrition and strengthen customer
loyalty.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities for planning
long-horizon, real-world tasks, yet existing agent benchmarks focus on task
completion while neglecting time efficiency in parallel and asynchronous
operations. To address this, we present ParaCook, a benchmark for
time-efficient collaborative planning. Inspired by the Overcooked game,
ParaCook provides an environment for various challenging interaction planning
of multi-agent systems that are instantiated as cooking tasks, with a
simplified action space to isolate the core challenge of strategic parallel
planning. Through a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, we find
that current approaches achieve suboptimal plans, which struggle with parallel
actions or coordination. Our analysis also reveals LLMs' potential on abstract
tasks where they can focus on high-level parallel optimization. ParaCook
provides a scalable evaluation framework with adjustable complexity,
establishing a foundation for developing and assessing time efficiency-aware
multi-agent planning. The code and data are available at

Conclusion: SR-Scientist成功将LLM转变为自主AI科学家，显著提升了科学方程发现的性能，并展示了良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been applied to scientific
equation discovery, leveraging their embedded scientific knowledge for
hypothesis generation. However, current methods typically confine LLMs to the
role of an equation proposer within search algorithms like genetic programming.
In this paper, we present SR-Scientist, a framework that elevates the LLM from
a simple equation proposer to an autonomous AI scientist that writes code to
analyze data, implements the equation as code, submits it for evaluation, and
optimizes the equation based on experimental feedback. Specifically, we wrap
the code interpreter into a set of tools for data analysis and equation
evaluation. The agent is instructed to optimize the equation by utilizing these
tools over a long horizon with minimal human-defined pipelines. Empirical
results show that SR-Scientist outperforms baseline methods by an absolute
margin of 6% to 35% on datasets covering four science disciplines.
Additionally, we demonstrate our method's robustness to noise, the
generalization of the discovered equations to out-of-domain data, and their
symbolic accuracy. Furthermore, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning
framework to enhance the agent's capabilities.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文提出了CLoD-GS框架，将连续细节层次（CLoD）机制集成到3D高斯泼溅表示中，解决了传统离散细节层次方法的存储开销和视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散细节层次方法需要存储多个模型副本且会产生视觉"弹出"伪影，而3D高斯泼溅技术的显式基元特性为实现连续细节层次提供了理想基础。

Method: 为每个高斯基元引入可学习的距离相关衰减参数，动态调整不透明度；采用虚拟距离缩放机制和从粗到细的训练策略，结合渲染点数量正则化。

Conclusion: 该方法成功消除了离散方法的存储开销和视觉伪影，为实时计算机图形学中的细节层次管理提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Level of Detail (LoD) is a fundamental technique in real-time computer
graphics for managing the rendering costs of complex scenes while preserving
visual fidelity. Traditionally, LoD is implemented using discrete levels
(DLoD), where multiple, distinct versions of a model are swapped out at
different distances. This long-standing paradigm, however, suffers from two
major drawbacks: it requires significant storage for multiple model copies and
causes jarring visual ``popping" artifacts during transitions, degrading the
user experience. We argue that the explicit, primitive-based nature of the
emerging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique enables a more ideal paradigm:
Continuous LoD (CLoD). A CLoD approach facilitates smooth, seamless quality
scaling within a single, unified model, thereby circumventing the core problems
of DLOD. To this end, we introduce CLoD-GS, a framework that integrates a
continuous LoD mechanism directly into a 3DGS representation. Our method
introduces a learnable, distance-dependent decay parameter for each Gaussian
primitive, which dynamically adjusts its opacity based on viewpoint proximity.
This allows for the progressive and smooth filtering of less significant
primitives, effectively creating a continuous spectrum of detail within one
model. To train this model to be robust across all distances, we introduce a
virtual distance scaling mechanism and a novel coarse-to-fine training strategy
with rendered point count regularization. Our approach not only eliminates the
storage overhead and visual artifacts of discrete methods but also reduces the
primitive count and memory footprint of the final model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CLoD-GS achieves smooth, quality-scalable rendering from a
single model, delivering high-fidelity results across a wide range of
performance targets.

Abstract: In this work we analyze and address a fundamental restriction that blocks the
reliable application of codimensional yarn-level and shell models with
thickness, to simulate real-world woven and knit fabrics. As discretizations
refine toward practical and accurate physical modeling, such models can
generate non-physical contact forces with stencil-neighboring elements in the
simulation mesh, leading to severe locking artifacts. While not well-documented
in the literature, this restriction has so far been addressed with two
alternatives with undesirable tradeoffs. One option is to restrict the mesh to
coarse resolutions, however, this eliminates the possibility of accurate (and
consistent) resolution simulations across real-world material variations. A
second alternative instead seeks to cull contact pairs that can create such
locking forces in the first place. This relaxes resolution restrictions but
compromise robustness. Culling can and will generate unacceptable and
unpredictable geometric intersections and tunneling that destroys weaving and
knitting structures and cause unrecoverable pull-throughs. We address these
challenges to simulating real-world materials with a new and practical
contact-processing model for thickened codimensional simulation, that removes
resolution restrictions, while guaranteeing contact-locking-free,
non-intersecting simulations. We demonstrate the application of our model
across a wide range of previously unavailable simulation scenarios, with
real-world material yarn and fabric parameters and patterns, challenging
simulation conditions and mesh resolutions, and both rod and shell models,
integrated with the IPC barrier.

Conclusion: GraphTracer为多智能体系统调试提供了一个稳健的解决方案，通过信息依赖分析显著提高了故障归因的准确性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by Large Language Models excel at complex tasks
through coordinated collaboration, yet they face high failure rates in
multi-turn deep search scenarios. Existing temporal attribution methods
struggle to accurately diagnose root causes, particularly when errors propagate
across multiple agents. Attempts to automate failure attribution by analyzing
action sequences remain ineffective due to their inability to account for
information dependencies that span agents. This paper identifies two core
challenges: \textit{(i) distinguishing symptoms from root causes in multi-agent
error propagation}, and \textit{(ii) tracing information dependencies beyond
temporal order}. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{GraphTracer}, a
framework that redefines failure attribution through information flow analysis.
GraphTracer constructs Information Dependency Graphs (IDGs) to explicitly
capture how agents reference and build on prior outputs. It localizes root
causes by tracing through these dependency structures instead of relying on
temporal sequences. GraphTracer also uses graph-aware synthetic data generation
to target critical nodes, creating realistic failure scenarios. Evaluations on
the Who\&When benchmark and integration into production systems demonstrate
that GraphTracer-8B achieves up to 18.18\% higher attribution accuracy compared
to state-of-the-art models and enables 4.8\% to 14.2\% performance improvements
in deployed multi-agent frameworks, establishing a robust solution for
multi-agent system debugging.

TL;DR: D3MAS是一个分层协调框架，通过分解、推理和分布三层结构解决多智能体系统中的知识冗余问题，显著提高推理准确性和减少冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的多智能体系统存在严重的知识冗余问题，智能体在检索和推理过程中重复努力，缺乏确保每个操作阶段共享最小充分信息的机制。

Method: 提出D3MAS框架，包含三个协调层：任务分解（早期过滤不相关子问题）、协作推理（捕获跨智能体的互补推理路径）和分布式内存（访问非冗余知识），通过统一异构图中的结构化消息传递进行协调。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的数据集上的实验显示，D3MAS持续将推理准确性提高了8.7%到15.6%，平均减少了46%的知识冗余。

Conclusion: D3MAS通过结构设计而非显式优化有效解决了多智能体系统中的知识冗余问题，证明了分层协调框架在提高协作效率方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems powered by large language models exhibit strong
capabilities in collaborative problem-solving. However, these systems suffer
from substantial knowledge redundancy. Agents duplicate efforts in retrieval
and reasoning processes. This inefficiency stems from a deeper issue: current
architectures lack mechanisms to ensure agents share minimal sufficient
information at each operational stage. Empirical analysis reveals an average
knowledge duplication rate of 47.3\% across agent communications. We propose
D3MAS (Decompose, Deduce, and Distribute), a hierarchical coordination
framework addressing redundancy through structural design rather than explicit
optimization. The framework organizes collaboration across three coordinated
layers. Task decomposition filters irrelevant sub-problems early. Collaborative
reasoning captures complementary inference paths across agents. Distributed
memory provides access to non-redundant knowledge. These layers coordinate
through structured message passing in a unified heterogeneous graph. This
cross-layer alignment ensures information remains aligned with actual task
needs. Experiments on four challenging datasets show that D3MAS consistently
improves reasoning accuracy by 8.7\% to 15.6\% and reduces knowledge redundancy
by 46\% on average.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型虽然能生成逼真场景，但难以产生真正新颖的内容。现有增强创造性的方法要么依赖图像特征插值（限制在预定义类别内），要么需要耗时的嵌入优化或模型微调。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成超越文本描述限制的创意输出提供了一条实用途径，无缝集成到现有扩散管道中，在保持对象有效性的同时显著提升创造性。

Abstract: Creative generation is the synthesis of new, surprising, and valuable samples
that reflect user intent yet cannot be envisioned in advance. This task aims to
extend human imagination, enabling the discovery of visual concepts that exist
in the unexplored spaces between familiar domains. While text-to-image
diffusion models excel at rendering photorealistic scenes that faithfully match
user prompts, they still struggle to generate genuinely novel content. Existing
approaches to enhance generative creativity either rely on interpolation of
image features, which restricts exploration to predefined categories, or
require time-intensive procedures such as embedding optimization or model
fine-tuning. We propose VLM-Guided Adaptive Negative-Prompting, a
training-free, inference-time method that promotes creative image generation
while preserving the validity of the generated object. Our approach utilizes a
vision-language model (VLM) that analyzes intermediate outputs of the
generation process and adaptively steers it away from conventional visual
concepts, encouraging the emergence of novel and surprising outputs. We
evaluate creativity through both novelty and validity, using statistical
metrics in the CLIP embedding space. Through extensive experiments, we show
consistent gains in creative novelty with negligible computational overhead.
Moreover, unlike existing methods that primarily generate single objects, our
approach extends to complex scenarios, such as generating coherent sets of
creative objects and preserving creativity within elaborate compositional
prompts. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion pipelines,
offering a practical route to producing creative outputs that venture beyond
the constraints of textual descriptions.

Motivation: 中轴结构（包含相互连接的片、接缝和连接点）为3D形状提供了自然的体积分解，但现有方法难以同时保持结构完整性和网格质量。

Method: 采用结构感知的基于粒子的优化流程，通过受限功率图（RPD）引导，使用球形二次误差度量（SQEM）投影约束中轴球体运动，高斯核能量促进均匀空间分布。

Result: 与MATFP和MATTopo等方法相比，该方法产生更清晰准确的中轴结构，网格质量显著改善；与体素、点云和变分方法相比，首次将结构感知集成到优化过程中。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成具有优异几何保真度、拓扑正确性和明确结构分解的中轴网格。

Abstract: We propose a novel optimization framework for computing the medial axis
transform that simultaneously preserves the medial structure and ensures high
medial mesh quality. The medial structure, consisting of interconnected sheets,
seams, and junctions, provides a natural volumetric decomposition of a 3D
shape. Our method introduces a structure-aware, particle-based optimization
pipeline guided by the restricted power diagram (RPD), which partitions the
input volume into convex cells whose dual encodes the connectivity of the
medial mesh. Structure-awareness is enforced through a spherical quadratic
error metric (SQEM) projection that constrains the movement of medial spheres,
while a Gaussian kernel energy encourages an even spatial distribution.
Compared to feature-preserving methods such as MATFP and MATTopo, our approach
produces cleaner and more accurate medial structures with significantly
improved mesh quality. In contrast to voxel-based, point-cloud-based, and
variational methods, our framework is the first to integrate structural
awareness into the optimization process, yielding medial meshes with superior
geometric fidelity, topological correctness, and explicit structural
decomposition.

TL;DR: 提出以关怀为中心、关注后果的可视化框架，将野火数据视为生态和社会交织的活档案，而非静态指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新构想野火数据，将其视为有纹理、受伤的档案，强调野火作为共享时间条件的本质，跨越自然周期和人类系统

Method: 结合植物启发的数据形式、基于事件的地图绘制和叙事分层，创造体现性、关系性和伦理性的可视化方法

Result: 开发了一个能够展示野火作为生态和社会纠缠活档案的可视化框架

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种激进伦理的视角，将野火数据重新概念化为有纹理、体现性和关系性的档案，而非简化的可视化

Abstract: The Fire We Share proposes a care-centered, consequence-aware visualization
framework for engaging with wildfire data not as static metrics, but as living
archives of ecological and social entanglement. By combining plants-inspired
data forms, event-based mapping, and narrative layering, the project
foregrounds fire as a shared temporal condition-one that cuts across natural
cycles and human systems. Rather than simplifying wildfire data into digestible
visuals, The Fire We Share reimagines it as a textured, wounded
archive-embodied, relational, and radically ethical.
