### [1] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种相机姿态估计的协方差下界计算方法，通过将可微分渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 姿态估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域应用广泛，但现有工作很少对密集或学习模型下的姿态提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对姿态扰动进行线性化，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao界，该方法可还原为经典束调整不确定性。

Result: 该方法能够扩展到多智能体设置，通过融合多个相机的Fisher信息，确保与视觉理论的连续性。

Conclusion: 这种统计公式在合作感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成等下游任务中具有应用价值。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [2] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU是一个数据可视化理解任务套件，用于诊断视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解中的错误来源。研究发现模型失败主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因不明。研究旨在确定错误来源：是视觉信息编码、视觉-语言模块间信息传递，还是语言模块处理的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件来精确识别困难来源，使用激活修补和线性探针追踪信息流，测试三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型，分析不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型无法正确生成单个数据点坐标，这些初始错误导致最终响应错误。当提供正确坐标时性能显著提升。即使模型生成错误响应，正确坐标仍可从视觉编码器的潜在表示中读取，表明错误源于视觉-语言交接。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在架构限制，在可靠的数据可视化理解方面面临重大挑战。提供正确坐标有助于少量数据点任务，但会恶化需要从多个数据点提取统计关系的任务。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [3] [Improving the Physics of Video Generation with VJEPA-2 Reward Signal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21840)
*Jianhao Yuan,Xiaofeng Zhang,Felix Friedrich,Nicolas Beltran-Velez,Melissa Hall,Reyhane Askari-Hemmat,Xiaochuang Han,Nicolas Ballas,Michal Drozdzal,Adriana Romero-Soriano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该报告介绍了在ICCV 2025物理IQ挑战赛中的获胜方案，通过将SSL预训练的视频世界模型VJEPA-2与最先进的视频生成模型MAGI-1结合，提升了视频生成的物理合理性约6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型虽然视觉上真实，但缺乏物理理解能力，经常产生不合理的视频。物理IQ基准测试表明视觉真实性与物理理解并不等同，而SSL预训练在自然视频上能产生直觉物理理解。

Method: 在MAGI-1视频生成模型基础上，结合Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2)来指导生成过程，利用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号。

Result: 通过VJEPA-2作为奖励信号，成功将最先进视频生成模型的物理合理性提升了约6%。

Conclusion: SSL预训练的视频世界模型可以有效提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，为改善视频生成的物理真实性提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

### [4] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，在植物病害诊断任务上显著优于标准解码方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决发展中国家农业病害管理面临的专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠和成本约束等问题，提高AI系统在农业图像描述中的可靠性。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的图像描述，并加入人机交互环节让用户确认作物类型以过滤错误生成。

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%的准确率，优于贪婪解码的77.5%；考虑多个聚类时，前4个候选聚类的准确率提升至94.0%。

Conclusion: 该自一致性框架能有效提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述任务中的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [5] [LSF-Animation: Label-Free Speech-Driven Facial Animation via Implicit Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21864)
*Xin Lu,Chuanqing Zhuang,Chenxi Jin,Zhengda Lu,Yiqun Wang,Wu Liu,Jun Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LSF-Animation是一个无需显式情感和身份标签的语音驱动3D面部动画框架，通过从语音中隐式提取情感信息、从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征，并引入分层交互融合块来整合各种线索，在未见过的说话者和情感状态下具有更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式的一热编码来表示身份和情感，需要给定的情感和身份标签，限制了向未见说话者的泛化能力，且忽视了语音中固有的情感线索，限制了生成动画的自然性和适应性。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架：1）从语音中隐式提取情感信息；2）从中性面部网格中捕获身份特征；3）引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)，使用融合令牌整合双变换器特征，更有效地整合情感、运动和身份相关线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实性方面超越了当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化，同时提高了动画的自然性和适应性。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

### [6] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两个专门用于艺术控制的ControlNet：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制对象位置和大小，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制场景3D几何。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文生图扩散模型生成高质量图像，但对输出的空间和几何结构控制有限，需要专门的控制方法。

Method: 开发了两个ControlNet模块：比例ControlNet使用边界框控制对象位置和比例，透视ControlNet使用消失线控制3D场景几何。利用视觉语言模型进行数据标注和专门的算法进行条件图像合成。

Result: 实验表明两个模块都提供了有效的控制，但在复杂约束条件下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两个ControlNet模型在艺术控制方面表现有效，已发布在HuggingFace平台上。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [7] [MOGRAS: Human Motion with Grasping in 3D Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22199)
*Kunal Bhosikar,Siddharth Katageri,Vivek Madhavaram,Kai Han,Charu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MOGRAS数据集，填补了在3D场景中生成逼真全身抓取动作的空白，并提出了简单有效的方法来改进现有方法在场景感知生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么能生成3D场景中的全身动作但缺乏精细抓取能力，要么能生成精确抓取动作但忽略3D场景，需要解决在3D场景中生成物理合理的全身抓取动作这一挑战。

Method: 创建了MOGRAS大规模数据集，包含预抓取全身行走动作和最终抓取姿势，并提出简单有效的方法来适配现有方法在3D场景中的工作。

Result: 通过大量定量和定性实验验证了数据集的有效性，并展示了所提方法在场景感知生成方面的显著改进。

Conclusion: MOGRAS数据集和所提方法为更逼真的人-场景交互铺平了道路，解决了现有方法在场景感知抓取生成方面的局限性。

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

### [8] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个使用3D生成模型合成数据学习3D人-物交互（HOI）功能的新框架，涵盖接触、方向和空间占用，无需人工标注


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖人工标注数据集且仅限于接触分析的局限性，需要更全面理解人-物交互的其他关键方面如方向和空间占用

Method: 采用基于密集3D流量的表示方法，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习，仅使用合成数据训练

Result: H2OFlow能有效泛化到真实世界物体，在建模3D功能方面超越了依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法

Conclusion: H2OFlow框架能够全面学习3D HOI功能，无需人工标注，为计算机视觉、机器人和AI领域的人-物交互理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

*Rishit Dagli,Donglai Xiang,Vismay Modi,Charles Loop,Clement Fuji Tsang,Anka He Chen,Anita Hu,Gavriel State,David I. W. Levin,Maria Shugrina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，通过多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测3D物体的体积材料属性（杨氏模量、泊松比、密度），无需手工制作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟依赖空间变化的力学属性，传统方法需要费力手工制作，VoMP旨在自动预测这些属性。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合，通过训练的几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在代码，这些代码位于物理合理材料流形上。

Result: VoMP在准确性和速度上远超现有技术，能够准确估计体积属性。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种有效的自动预测3D物体材料属性的方法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

### [11] [Yesnt: Are Diffusion Relighting Models Ready for Capture Stage Compositing? A Hybrid Alternative to Bridge the Gap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23494)
*Elisabeth Jüttner,Leona Krath,Stefan Korfhage,Hannah Dröge,Matthias B. Hullin,Markus Plack*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种混合重光照框架，结合扩散模型生成的材料先验与时间正则化和物理渲染，实现更稳定的体积视频重光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前体积视频重光照方法在时间稳定性方面存在不足，扩散方法在单帧效果良好但在序列中会产生随机噪声和不稳定性，而视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模。

Method: 混合方法结合扩散模型生成的材料先验、时间正则化（光流引导）和物理渲染。通过聚合多帧材料属性估计获得时间一致的着色组件，并使用高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行间接效果渲染。

Result: 在真实和合成捕获数据上的实验表明，该方法比纯扩散基线在序列重光照方面显著更稳定，且能处理超出视频扩散模型可行范围的长片段。

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤。

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集和引入3D面部渲染通道，解决了文本到图像模型中的面部属性泄漏和物理一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的模型。

Method: 1. 构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2. 使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为骨干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3. 设计语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑应用中具有实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

*Shuhong Zheng,Ashkan Mirzaei,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TIRE是一种新的主题驱动3D/4D生成方法，通过跟踪、修复和重投影三个步骤，显著提升了跨视角的语义身份保持能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D/4D生成方法在保持跨视角语义身份一致性方面存在不足，主题驱动的3D/4D生成研究仍较少。

Method: 使用现有3D生成模型的输出作为输入，通过视频跟踪识别需要修改的区域，采用主题驱动的2D修复模型逐步填充这些区域，然后将修改后的多视角2D观测重投影回3D。

Result: 大量实验表明，相比最先进的方法，该方法在3D/4D生成中显著提高了身份保持能力。

Conclusion: TIRE方法有效解决了3D/4D生成中的语义身份保持问题，为个性化3D/4D生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

### [14] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究量化了紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，发现64位和128位模板的年龄漂移分别为1.357和2.571比特/十年，表明随着时间推移类内距离会系统性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板在时间维度上的稳定性，这对于智能卡和片上匹配部署的长期可靠性至关重要。

Method: 使用现代人脸CNN提取浮点嵌入，通过PCA-ITQ压缩为64位和128位代码，对AgeDB中每个身份建立汉明距离与绝对年龄差的线性模型。

Result: 在566个身份中，64位模板的中位漂移为1.357比特/十年，128位模板为2.571比特/十年，分布主要为正值，表明类内距离随时间系统性增加。

Conclusion: 较短代码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性，建议采用定期重新注册和对经验不稳定比特位进行针对性奇偶校验等简单缓解措施。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [15] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于通过乳腺肿块细针穿刺图像特征进行乳腺癌早期检测，在保持高精度的同时提供模型解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在医疗应用中因黑盒特性而难以获得临床信任的问题，需要在保持高预测准确性的同时增强模型可解释性。

Method: 使用深度神经网络（ReLU激活函数、Adam优化器、二元交叉熵损失），并集成SHAP和LIME等模型无关的可解释AI技术来生成特征级归因和可视化解释。

Result: 模型达到0.992准确率、1.000精确率、0.977召回率和0.988 F1分数，显著优于传统算法，且细胞核凹点特征被识别为最具影响力的分类特征。

Conclusion: 该框架成功弥合了深度学习模型性能与可解释性之间的差距，为乳腺癌临床诊断提供了既准确又可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型准确率下降和更新延迟的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征随时间变化（如光照、天气条件变化）会导致模型准确率下降。现有方法面临计算密集的重新训练过程导致模型更新延迟，以及新模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的问题。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时效性和推理结果来增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关，同时减少更新延迟。此外，EdgeSync还包含动态训练管理模块，优化模型更新的时间和顺序以提高时效性。

Result: 在多样化和复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估表明，EdgeSync相比现有方法准确率提高约3.4%，相比传统方法提高约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过高效的样本过滤和动态训练管理，有效解决了边缘模型在实时视频分析中的准确率下降和更新延迟问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估了SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，发现边界框提示策略优于自动和单点方法，其中Box+MP组合在Khan数据集上获得最高性能（mIoU 0.64，Dice 0.75）。轻量级变体如TinySAM和MobileSAM更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割在计算机视觉中具有挑战性，因为火焰具有不规则边界、半透明边缘和变化强度。虽然SAM和SAM2展示了优秀的跨域泛化能力，但它们在火焰分割任务中的有效性，特别是在移动部署约束下的表现尚未被充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体（tiny、small、base_plus、large）以及移动导向变体（TinySAM、MobileSAM），在三个火焰数据集上使用多种提示策略：自动、单正点、单正点+单负点、多正点、边界框及其混合变体（Box+SP和Box+MP）。

Result: 边界框提示策略始终优于自动和单点方法，Box+MP在Khan数据集上获得最高平均IoU（0.64）和Dice系数（0.75）。轻量级变体显著降低了内存和计算成本，更适合延迟容忍的边缘场景。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在火焰监控系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为未来领域特定SAM应用研究建立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布的聚合程度来判断样本是否属于训练集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛应用带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击可能泄露训练数据信息。

Method: 基于噪声注入和噪声分布聚合度评估，利用扩散模型对训练集和非训练集样本在噪声预测模式上的差异。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现优异，对大规模文本到图像扩散模型在ASR和AUC指标上显示出更好的攻击效果。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了扩散模型存在成员推理攻击漏洞，且具有较好的可扩展性，为扩散模型的隐私保护提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了AVEP任务和EventFormer模型，用于视频事件预测，构建了包含3.5万标注视频的大型数据集，在复杂逻辑推理方面优于现有视频预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类事件多以视频形式记录，但现有研究主要集中在文本脚本的事件推理，缺乏视觉领域的事件预测研究。

Method: 提出EventFormer模型，采用节点-图层次注意力机制，能捕捉事件与参数间的关系以及参数间的共指关系。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型超越了多个SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务复杂性和数据集价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务具有挑战性，EventFormer模型能有效处理复杂事件结构，数据集将为视频事件预测研究提供重要支持。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要测量值与测量矩阵严格匹配才能重建图像，但实际应用中由于系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对准，导致传统重建算法失效。

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准求解算法来构造新的测量矩阵，并提供了详细的数学证明。

Result: 实验结果表明，在低噪声水平下，构造的矩阵可用于传统重建算法，成功重建原始图像；算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论为测量矩阵未知情况下的图像重建提供了有效解决方案，讨论了其局限性和潜在应用。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型来提供令牌级推理时对齐，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的输出容易出现与视觉输入不符的幻觉文本，而现有的对齐方法要么依赖昂贵的微调，要么只提供粗粒度的延迟反馈。

Method: 冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为奖励模型和目标VLM之间的对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中表现一致提升，LLaVA-1.5-7B和13B在MMVet上提升8.6%，POPE上提升6.7%，其他模型在幻觉减少和VQA准确率方面也有可比提升。

Conclusion: TITA框架能有效减少幻觉，提高视觉语言模型的理解能力，且推理开销可忽略不计。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

<details>

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接采用跨领域架构，限制了有效捕捉时间序列数据固有的多尺度时间依赖关系，特别是在零样本迁移到不同模式和采样策略的数据集时表现不佳

Method: 提出分层交错块注意力(HIBA)，使用分层块间和块内稀疏注意力来捕捉多尺度依赖关系。块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力在块间操作以捕捉全局时间模式交互和动态演化

Result: Xihe模型家族从9.5M到1.5B参数规模，在GIFT-Eval基准测试中，最小的Xihe-tiny(9.5M)超越多数当代TSFMs，Xihe-max(1.5B)在零样本性能上创下新纪录，大幅超越先前最佳结果

Conclusion: HIBA架构在整个参数范围内的一致优异性能证明了其卓越的泛化能力和架构优势，为时间序列基础模型提供了有效的多尺度依赖捕捉机制

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种使用两个并行采样器在有限去噪步骤下提高扩散模型采样质量的方法，通过适当整合两个采样器在连续时间步的信息来改善图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限去噪步骤（即扩散模型评估次数受限）的情况下，如何提高采样图像的质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间步进行去噪，并适当整合它们的信息到潜在图像中。方法简单、即插即用、模型无关，无需额外微调或外部模型。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证了该方法在不同扩散模型上的有效性，发现朴素的信息整合会降低采样质量，且增加更多并行采样器不一定能进一步提高质量。

Conclusion: 在有限去噪步骤下，两个并行采样器的适当信息整合可以有效提高扩散模型的采样质量，但需要精心设计整合策略，且更多采样器不一定带来额外收益。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的微调任务MPCC，通过重构被遮挡图像中的语义内容来增强多模态模型的视觉上下文和常识推理能力，并开发了专门的评估基准和训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型主要关注单模态语言任务，在多模态场景特别是视觉语言任务中的适应能力存在显著差距，无法充分利用视觉上下文和常识知识。

Method: 引入遮挡预测任务，开发MPCC评估基准，并提出带先验采样的强化微调方法。

Result: 该方法不仅提升了模型性能，还增强了在分布外和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: MPCC任务为多模态推理提供了有效基础，所提出的训练方法显著提升了模型的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SRE-CLIP适配器框架，通过语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决了CLIP在领域自适应零样本学习中的两个核心挑战，在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注成本高昂，现有范式无法平衡跨领域迁移和跨类别泛化，需要领域自适应零样本学习(DAZSL)。虽然视觉语言模型(如CLIP)在DAZSL领域具有固有优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出语义关系增强的CLIP(SRE-CLIP)适配器框架，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决跨类别知识转移效率低和跨模态对齐退化问题。

Result: 在I2AwA和I2WebV基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP是首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，成功解决了CLIP在DAZSL应用中的核心挑战，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态机器人导航系统决策过程复杂且不透明，可解释系统与高性能之间存在权衡，需要既能解释决策又保持高性能的方法

Method: 将动作语言描述作为强化学习导航的辅助任务，利用预训练描述生成模型（如视觉语言模型）进行知识蒸馏，解决缺乏真实数据的问题

Result: 在各种导航任务中全面评估，证明方法既能描述动作又能获得高导航性能，在语义视听导航任务中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 通过将语言描述作为辅助任务并利用知识蒸馏，成功实现了可解释且高性能的多模态导航系统

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，早期无症状但会导致不可逆视力丧失。印度等糖尿病高发地区急需准确、可扩展的筛查方法。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合手工特征提取（捕捉关键临床标记）和深度学习（自动层次模式识别），融合可解释临床数据与学习特征。

Result: 该模型超越了单独的深度学习方法，展示了优越的分类性能并减少了假阴性结果。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动方法能够实现可扩展、准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查，对糖尿病负担重的地区至关重要。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,

inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SITS-DECO是一个基于GPT风格解码器架构的生成式地球观测基础模型，通过统一序列框架处理多模态EO数据，在无需任务特定适配的情况下实现多种监督和自监督任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EO基础模型需要额外适配、结构僵化的问题，借鉴大语言模型的统一序列预测方法，简化EO数据的使用。

Method: 采用简单的GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示在统一架构中执行多种任务，无需任务或模态特定适配，专注于密集时间序列建模。

Result: 在作物类型分类任务（PASTIS-R）上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明了密集时间序列建模在当前范式中的重要性。

Conclusion: 展示了以数据为中心的建模范式，模型能力源于训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在手势识别准确性和响应时间方面存在局限，需要开发更高效的自由手势理解系统。

Method: 结合预训练大视觉语言模型、嵌入解剖学手部先验的地标处理模块，以及分步语义推理的思维链策略。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健和适应性强的自由手势理解，并开发了首个包含30万标注问答对的开源自由手势意图推理数据集。

Conclusion: Gestura系统通过多组件协同工作，有效解决了自由手势理解中的挑战，为人类-计算机交互提供了更自然的手势交互方式。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Motivation: 评估AI文本到图像生成系统是否能够准确呈现提示中明确指定的属性，这对于检测偏见和模型评估具有重要意义。

Method: 使用两个公共数据集（200张文化创意行业女性工作者和230张博物馆策展人的可视化图像），评估了个人属性（年龄、头发）、外观（服装、眼镜）和随身物品（姓名标签、剪贴板）的准确性。

Result: DALL-E3在所有属性中（n=710）有15.6%偏离了提示规范。随身物品的错误率最低，个人外观中等，人物本身的描绘（特别是年龄）错误率最高。

Conclusion: 研究证明了文本到图像生成中存在可测量的提示保真度差距，这对偏见检测和模型评估具有重要影响。

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

Motivation: GAN生成的图像检测在数字图像取证中面临重大挑战，需要开发有效的检测方法来识别生成图像与真实图像的区别。

Method: 使用离散小波变换（DWT）预处理，应用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将输入图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类，利用生成过程中留下的细微伪影进行区分。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别为93.8%和95.1%，远高于空间域模型的81.5%。Daubechies模型表现优于Haar，表明增加描述性频率模式层可以提高区分能力。

Conclusion: GAN生成的图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或'指纹'，小波域分析在检测GAN图像方面非常有效，为未来深度伪造检测系统的开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Result: DenseNet121表现更优：脑肿瘤检测准确率94.3% vs 92.5%，肺炎检测准确率89.1% vs 84.4%。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更聚焦核心病理区域，而ResNet50有时分散注意力到外围区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理多模态医疗数据中的模态缺失问题，通过分布对齐和轻量级Transformer设计，在不完整模态情况下仍能保持高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

### [42] [Towards Accurate and Efficient Waste Image Classification: A Hybrid Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21833)
*Ngoc-Bao-Quang Nguyen,Tuan-Minh Do,Cong-Tam Phan,Thi-Thu-Hong Phan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种垃圾图像分类方法：传统机器学习、深度学习和混合方法。实验表明混合方法（深度学习特征提取+传统分类器）在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率高达100%，同时通过特征选择减少95%以上特征维度而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图像的自动化垃圾分类是全球废物管理的关键组成部分，但缺乏整合机器学习、深度学习和高效混合解决方案的系统性基准测试。

Method: 比较三种范式：(1) 基于手工特征的机器学习算法；(2) 深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S）；(3) 混合方法（深度模型特征提取+传统分类器如SVM和逻辑回归）。在三个公开数据集上进行实验。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最优：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%准确率，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择可减少95%以上特征维度而不影响精度。

Conclusion: 本研究为垃圾分类建立了更可靠的基准，并提出了高效的混合框架，在保持高精度的同时降低推理成本，适合在资源受限环境中进行规模化部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o在零样本设置下对胸部X光图像进行正常/肺炎分类的能力，最高准确率达到74%，但诊断可靠性仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ChatGPT等大型语言模型在医学图像解释方面的潜力，特别是在没有专门微调的情况下进行零样本分类的能力。

Method: 使用平衡测试集（400张图像，每类200张），比较四种不同的提示设计：从简单指令到详细推理提示。

Result: 简洁、特征导向的提示获得最高分类准确率74%，而推理导向的提示表现较差。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出初步潜力，但需要进一步改进视觉推理和领域适应能力才能安全应用于临床实践。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet通过可训练的理性小波变换前端增强CNN-Transformer主干网络，在脑机接口运动想象任务中显著提升了最难被试者的解码准确性，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于运动想象的脑机接口在非侵入式EEG信号中面临的非平稳性、低信噪比和个体差异等挑战，特别是在最难被试者上的可靠性问题。

Method: 采用可训练的理性小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，结合CNN进行局部时空特征提取，使用分组查询注意力编码器处理长程上下文，最后通过TCN进行因果时间整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上，RatioWaveNet相比Transformer主干网络，在最差被试者准确率上分别提升了0.17/0.42和1.07/2.54个百分点，同时保持了平均性能增益和适度的计算开销。

Conclusion: 可训练的小波前端是增强基于Transformer的脑机接口的有效插件，能够在不牺牲效率的情况下提高最差情况下的可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前统一多模态模型存在的系统性缺陷，即模型能准确记忆视觉概念但无法用文字表达，这可能导致AI安全框架的漏洞

Method: 通过实验验证领先模型在生成电影艺术品图像和文字描述时的表现差异，并在多个架构的合成数据集上进行受控实验

Result: 确认模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性而非训练伪影，仅基于文本对齐的模型仍能生成不安全图像

Conclusion: 模态失语症揭示了多模态模型的内在局限性，对AI安全构成实际风险，需要跨模态的安全对齐方法

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在长上下文视觉信息理解方面的挑战，特别是在GUI控制和网页导航等代理任务中。现有方法内存消耗大且忽略了决策导向的文档理解。

Method: 提出链式滚动机制选择性递归导航文档，引入专用数据生成管道构建信息轨迹，以及针对性的强化学习方法Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization。

Result: 显著降低内存使用，有效建模人类阅读行为，是多页文档问答中首个显式建模代理阅读模式的框架。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM通过创新的导航机制和优化方法，提升了多模态代理在长文档理解方面的能力，为本地可部署解决方案提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFCT是一种新的训练方法，允许Poisson Flow一致性模型独立训练，无需依赖预训练模型，在CT图像去噪任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Poisson Flow一致性模型只能通过蒸馏方式训练，限制了其在多种数据模态中的应用潜力。

Method: 利用扰动核去除预训练PFGM++依赖，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布，提高适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，LPIPS和SSIM指标均有改善，去噪效果与一致性模型相当。

Conclusion: PFCT为PFCM提供了更灵活的训练方式，在生成建模领域具有应用潜力，但需要进一步优化和验证。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段混合框架，使用现代检测和视觉语言模型自动解释2D多视图工程图，包括布局分割、注释检测和语义内容解析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂多视图工程图解释的挑战，包括变化布局、方向和混合符号文本内容，传统方法难以有效处理。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) YOLOv11-det进行布局分割；2) YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知的细粒度注释检测；3) 两个基于Donut的VLMs进行语义解析（字母型VLM提取文本信息，数值型VLM解释定量数据）。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可扩展的智能工程图分析解决方案，统一的JSON输出可与CAD和制造数据库无缝集成。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了WM-MoE，首个基于世界模型的运动预测框架，通过统一感知、时间记忆和决策来应对高风险极端场景的挑战。结合LLM增强长期推理，使用MoE分解复杂场景，并在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在安全关键极端场景（corner cases）中表现不佳，因为训练数据中常见场景过度代表且泛化能力有限。需要解决这些高风险情况下的运动预测问题。

Method: 构建紧凑场景表示，结合LLM和轻量级时间标记器增强时间上下文，引入MoE分解复杂极端场景，路由器分配场景给专门专家进行意图推断和反事实推演。

Result: 在四个基准数据集（nuScenes、NGSIM、HighD、MoCAD）上的广泛实验表明，WM-MoE始终优于最先进的基线方法，在极端场景和数据缺失条件下保持稳健。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为完全自动驾驶汽车中稳健和可泛化的运动预测展示了前景。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive

(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured
strong public interest. As they continue to advance at a rapid pace, the

this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过稀疏-稠密残差融合实现高达75%的token丢弃，显著降低训练成本同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)虽然生成性能优异，但其二次训练成本随序列长度增长，使得大规模预训练极其昂贵。现有token丢弃方法要么参数繁重，要么在高丢弃率下失效。

Method: 利用浅层和深层互补作用：浅层处理所有token捕获局部细节，深层操作稀疏子集减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长时掩码预训练和短时全token微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现9.8倍训练节省，FID/FDD指标相当。推理时Path-Drop Guidance(PDG)几乎减半FLOPs同时提升质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高保真图像合成方面表现出色，但在医学影像等专业领域微调时面临数据稀缺和计算成本高的问题，需要开发高效的迁移学习方法。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，使用潜在形态自编码器保持域特定潜在一致性，并采用像素级判别器进行对抗对齐，仅优化小型残差适配器模块。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在各种低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型在测试时进行受控生成任务时，由于采样过程的迭代性质，使用基于梯度的优化直接控制最终图像在计算上不切实际。

Method: 提出FlowOpt框架，使用零阶（无梯度）优化方法，将整个流过程视为黑盒，无需通过模型反向传播，并提供了步长选择的收敛保证。

Result: FlowOpt在图像编辑任务中达到最先进水平，使用与现有方法大致相同的神经网络函数评估次数，支持图像反演和直接引导编辑。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一种高效、可监控的优化方法，能够在整个采样路径上进行优化，无需梯度计算，在图像编辑任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器学习中鲁棒性这一关键问题，当显著特征和虚假特征在像素空间中重叠时，传统的显著性图方法可能产生误导性解释。

Method: 通过新颖的网络手术方法将待解释的独立模型集成到对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)模型中，构建基于字幕的XAI模型。

Conclusion: 基于字幕的XAI方法显著有助于开发更鲁棒的机器学习模型，通过概念层面的解释减少像素空间重叠带来的误导风险。

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

TL;DR: 提出VLM-SlideEval框架评估视觉语言模型在幻灯片理解上的表现，发现现有模型在像素级提取和跨幻灯片叙事结构理解方面存在局限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容，包括演示幻灯片，但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索

Method: 开发VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试VLMs：元素级提取、对几何/样式/文本扰动的鲁棒性、以及高级理解能力（如从乱序幻灯片恢复叙事顺序）

Result: VLMs在像素级提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议度、保真度和一致性，在单幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但无法可靠捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面存在局限性，需要开发校准的、批评者参与循环的评估器来驱动智能代理流程中的迭代优化和选择

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合人体检测跟踪和时空建模的深度学习框架，用于监控视频中的多类异常检测，在UCF-Crime数据集上取得92.41%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的挑战：异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景相关的视觉干扰。

Method: 使用YOLO-World检测人体实例，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，BiLSTM捕获时序动态。

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类F1分数均超过0.85，表现出对类别不平衡的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 聚焦前景的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GIFT方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力变化生成显著性图，增强关键视觉信息和用户查询的注意力，有效减少VLM中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅按比例放大视觉token注意力，但忽视了视觉注意力沉没问题（注意力被错误分配到无关区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题，导致错误区域被放大且无法正确理解用户查询。

Method: GIFT方法预计算整体视觉显著性图，通过跟踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力正向变化（"注视转移"），利用该图在每一步解码中增强对显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力。

Result: 实验表明GIFT在生成和分类任务中有效减少VLM幻觉，相比贪婪解码提升达20.7%，同时保持通用视觉语言性能且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT通过解决视觉注意力沉没和跨模态融合平衡问题，能有效缓解VLM中的幻觉生成，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像的3D T1加权脑MRI协调框架，通过分离解剖内容和扫描器/站点特定变化，使用SSIM损失保持生物特征同时减少站点间差异，显著提升了跨站点图像一致性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描器型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异导致多中心研究分析不一致和泛化性差，需要解决跨站点图像协调问题。

Method: 使用基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微损失函数，分离评估图像亮度、对比度和结构成分，通过多风格目标进行协调训练。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达0.97，亮度SSIM为0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低；脑年龄预测MAE从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，提高了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

*Xingjian Tao,Yiwei Wang,Yujun Cai,Yihong Luo,Jing Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是在高分辨率输入下。研究发现位置编码扰动会导致可预测的坐标偏差而非随机错误，表明模型依赖内部位置先验。提出了VPSG方法，通过扰动位置编码来引导坐标预测，在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上取得了可靠改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在挑战。高分辨率输入会产生长令牌序列，削弱位置编码并引入坐标输出中的方向偏差。本文旨在研究这一现象并改进坐标预测精度。

Method: 通过分析视觉位置编码被故意扰动时的模型行为，揭示了模型在空间基础信号退化时依赖内部位置先验。提出了Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG)方法，这是一种无需训练、在测试时使用的方法，利用方向性偏差进行校正。VPSG通过使用扰动的VPE进行辅助解码来隔离位置无关趋势，然后将其作为负证据来指导数字预测，同时通过轻量级有限状态机保持坐标格式。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，VPSG方法能够可靠地改进坐标预测性能，突出了位置编码鲁棒性对于MLLMs中空间推理的关键作用。

Conclusion: 位置编码的鲁棒性是多模态大语言模型进行空间推理的关键因素。通过分析位置编码扰动引起的可预测偏差，并利用VPSG方法进行校正，可以有效提高坐标预测的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Rainbow是一个条件图像生成框架，通过将输入条件分解为不同的潜在表示来生成多样化的图像，解决了传统方法在条件不确定性下的多样性生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统条件图像生成方法在条件包含不确定性时难以生成有意义的多样化输出，要么通过修改随机种子难以区分差异，要么通过多样化输入提示但受限于语言可解释的多样性。

Method: 将潜在图集成到提示表示计算中，使用生成流网络参数化该图，利用GFlowNets的先进图采样能力捕获不确定性并生成多样化的轨迹，从而产生多样化的条件表示和对应的输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估显示，Rainbow在图像合成、图像生成和反事实生成任务中在多样性和保真度方面都有改进。

Conclusion: Rainbow框架能够有效处理条件不确定性，生成多样化的合理图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Result: 在BDD100k、NuImages和Waymo数据集上生成了850万个高质量VQA对，人类验证准确率达到91.16%，相比现有方法的57.6%有显著提升。模型在空间推理概念上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GRAID通过2D几何原语方法生成了高质量的空间推理数据集，显著提升了视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all

Motivation: 深度立体匹配在基准数据集上通过微调取得了显著进展，但在零样本泛化方面不如其他视觉任务中的基础模型。现有方法在遮挡或弱纹理等挑战区域表现不佳，且过度依赖数据集特定先验。

Method: CogStereo将单目深度特征作为先验嵌入到细化过程中，捕捉超越局部对应的整体场景理解。采用双条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征，对不匹配进行一致的全局校正。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅达到了最先进的结果，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉推向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能确保结构一致的视差估计，实现了卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现优异，但对输入损坏导致的分布偏移很脆弱。本文研究损坏如何影响CLIP的图像嵌入。

Method: 提出Mint方法，使用均值累加器和梯度累加器在测试时最大化伪标签的类间方差，可在小批量下有效运行。

Result: Mint方法在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构上持续提升性能，代码已开源。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃与性能下降密切相关，最大化类间方差可有效提升嵌入质量，Mint方法简单有效且适用于小批量场景。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

Conclusion: 该数据集将情感和人格确立为自我中心感知的核心维度，为基于情感的行为、意图和交互建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现已知类别的高精度预测，并能区分未知类别，无需额外训练数据。

Conclusion: LOC框架有效提升了3D场景的开放集理解能力，为视觉语言模型在3D领域的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Conclusion: ARFNet框架通过注意力残差融合、对比学习和动态质心评估，有效缓解了SFDA中的负迁移和域偏移问题，在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Conclusion: I2-NeRF通过统一的辐射传输建模和等距采样策略，有效提升了在复杂介质环境下的3D感知能力，为生成式AI的物理世界感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: HARMONY框架通过联合利用多模态融合信息和输出分布，在VLMs的不确定性估计方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成YOLOv10n和DeepSORT的框架，用于建筑工地工人和障碍物的检测与跟踪，并开发了两种新型轨迹预测模型TrajGATFormer和TrajGATFormer-Obstacle，显著提高了轨迹预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着建筑行业对更快、更安全、更高效流程的需求增长，场外建筑带来了新的安全风险。传统方法难以适应建筑环境的动态性和不可预测性，需要开发能够考虑社会和环境因素的碰撞避免系统。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和模型能够有效捕捉时空交互，显著提高建筑环境中轨迹预测的准确性，为开发碰撞避免系统提供了有力支持。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GALA为多源主动域自适应提供了一种简单有效的解决方案，显著提升了目标域性能，同时保持了方法的通用性和易用性

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiffusionLane具有强大的泛化能力和有前景的检测性能，为车道检测任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的交通事故预测范式，从当前帧风险评分转向直接预测多个未来时间步的事故分数，解决了现有方法依赖模糊二元监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模糊的二元监督（将所有事故视频帧标记为正样本），但风险随时间连续变化，导致不可靠学习和误报。

Method: 使用片段级编码器联合建模时空动态，基于Transformer的时间解码器通过专用时间查询同时预测所有未来时间范围的事故分数。

Result: 在保持可接受误报率的前提下，该方法在召回率和事故时间预测方面均取得优异性能。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过精确标注的事故时间戳作为监督，实现了更可靠的事故预测，并在实际误报率约束下表现出色。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

TL;DR: 提出了GSAlign网络用于解决空中-地面行人重识别任务，通过可学习薄板样条模块和动态对齐模块共同处理几何变形和语义不对齐问题，在CARGO数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空中-地面行人重识别面临极端视角差异、遮挡和域差距等挑战，现有方法在处理严重姿态变化和空间不对齐方面存在局限。

Method: GSAlign网络包含两个关键组件：可学习薄板样条模块自适应地扭曲行人特征以补偿几何变化，动态对齐模块估计可见性感知表示掩码以减轻遮挡影响。

Result: 在CARGO数据集上的四个匹配协议评估中，GSAlign相比先前最优方法在mAP和Rank-1准确率上分别提升了+18.8%和+16.8%。

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何和语义对齐，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的关键挑战，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our
dataset construction pipeline employs various techniques, including filtering
and deduplication, which have been shown to be effective in previous studies.
To evaluate its effectiveness, we also construct WAON-Bench, a manually curated

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过比率归一化和梯度重加权解决了GRPO强化学习中重要性比率分布偏移问题，防止隐式过优化，稳定训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO框架中重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1且方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制无法有效约束过度自信的正向更新，造成隐式过优化问题。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法：1）比率归一化恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率；2）梯度重加权策略均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度。

Result: 在多个扩散模型上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少过优化，同时保持甚至提高生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard作为一种受调控的裁剪机制，能够稳定优化过程，有效缓解隐式过优化问题，无需依赖繁重的KL正则化。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Conclusion: 提出的基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中非常有效，能够显著提升模型性能

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程，先合成全局语义再细化局部细节，提供了一种高效且认知对齐的替代方案，更符合人类视觉感知过程。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Conclusion: T2SMark通过创新的尾截断采样和两阶段框架，成功解决了现有噪声水印方法在鲁棒性和多样性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code
is available at

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

both a Gaussian distribution grid (GDG), which models the spatial statistics of
the background using background-only scans, and a filtering algorithm that uses
this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with
minimal background data. Its efficient implementation ensures reliable
performance on low-resource hardware, enabling scalable real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了TDSR框架，将图像描述重新定义为分层规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著减少大模型调用次数，在多个基准测试中取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中存在的矛盾：强大的单步生成能力导致决策短视，难以在保持全局叙事连贯性的同时捕捉丰富细节

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出TDSR框架，包含视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络的高效MCTS算法，以及自适应早停机制

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中，TDSR作为即插即用模块显著提升了LLaVA-1.5、Qwen2.5-VL等现有模型的性能，在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面达到SOTA或极具竞争力的结果

Conclusion: TDSR通过分层规划方法有效解决了大视觉语言模型在图像描述中的根本挑战，在保持高质量规划的同时将昂贵的大模型调用频率降低了一个数量级

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Motivation: LiDAR在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，特别是在降雪天气中，但目前对各种天气条件下信号退化的程度缺乏量化研究。

Method: 开发基于物理的LiDAR模型，研究不同降雪率下的信号衰减，通过模拟将晴天数据转换为雪天场景，生成合成数据并与实际雪天条件进行比较。

Result: 建立了能够模拟不同降雪率下LiDAR信号衰减的物理模型，并生成了代表不同降雪条件的合成数据。

Conclusion: 该研究为量化LiDAR在雪天条件下的性能退化提供了方法，并展示了降雪对目标检测模型性能的具体影响，有助于改进恶劣天气条件下的自动驾驶感知系统。

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Motivation: 解决可穿戴辅助代理中的目标推断问题，消除用户与代理交互所需的努力，通过多模态上下文观察来推断用户目标。

Method: 收集了包含348名参与者的3,477条记录的多模态数据集，包含视觉、音频、数字和纵向上下文观察，并构建基准测试评估多种视觉语言模型。

Result: 人类表现优于模型（93% vs 84%准确率），大型模型表现更好但实用性有限（仅55%时间生成相关目标），多模态信息对模型有益。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在可穿戴辅助代理目标推断任务上仍有很大提升空间，需要进一步研究以实现实际应用价值。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Motivation: 冷冻电子断层扫描结合子体积平均是目前唯一能在分子分辨率下解析细胞内蛋白质结构的成像技术，但粒子挑选（定位和分类目标蛋白质）仍是主要瓶颈，由于依赖耗时的手动标注，大量未标注断层扫描数据未被充分利用。

Method: 框架包含两个组件：(1) 受关键点检测启发的端到端热图监督检测模型；(2) 师生协同训练机制，在稀疏标注条件下增强性能。还引入了多视图伪标注和冷冻电子断层扫描特定的DropBlock增强策略。

Result: 在大规模CZII数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法比监督基线F1分数提高了10%，证明了半监督学习在利用未标注冷冻电子断层扫描数据方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该半监督框架能够有效利用未标注数据，显著提升冷冻电子断层扫描中蛋白质粒子检测的性能，为解决该领域的数据标注瓶颈提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Motivation: 现有2D和3D生成模型在从单张静态图像生成高质量4D动态内容方面存在挑战，传统方法难以建模时间依赖性和准确捕捉动态几何变化，特别是在考虑相机视角变化时。

Method: 提出DynaPose4D框架，集成4D高斯泼溅和类别无关姿态估计技术，使用3D高斯泼溅从单张图像构建3D模型，然后基于选定视图的单次支持预测多视角姿态关键点，利用监督信号增强运动一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DynaPose4D在动态运动生成中实现了优秀的连贯性、一致性和流畅性。

Conclusion: 这些发现不仅验证了DynaPose4D框架的有效性，还表明了其在计算机视觉和动画制作领域的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Method: 为单个教师网络附加多个分支生成多视图，引入两种角度多样性目标：约束性角度间多样性损失（最大化视图间角度同时保持与原始输出的接近性）和角度内多样性损失（鼓励视图在原始输出周围均匀分布）。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种配置下超越了现有的知识增强方法，并且能够以即插即用的方式与其他知识蒸馏框架兼容，持续提升泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的角度多样性知识增强方法能够有效提升知识蒸馏性能，同时保持计算效率，具有良好的兼容性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

TL;DR: 提出GateFuseNet，一种自适应3D多模态融合网络，通过门控融合模块整合QSM和T1w MRI图像，用于帕金森病诊断，在准确率和AUC指标上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于幅度的MRI模态（如T1w）对帕金森病病理敏感性不足，而定量磁化率成像（QSM）能更准确地量化深部灰质核团中的铁沉积，但现有方法未能充分利用这两种模态的优势。

Method: 开发了门控融合模块，学习模态特定的注意力权重和通道级门控向量进行选择性特征调制，通过分层门控机制增强ROI感知特征并抑制无关信号。

Result: 方法在帕金森病诊断中达到85.00%准确率和92.06% AUC，优于三种现有最先进方法，消融研究验证了ROI引导、多模态集成和融合定位的贡献。

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应多模态融合有效提升了帕金森病的MRI诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型在生成逼真图像方面取得进展，但在涉及细粒度属性或时间敏感事件时经常产生与可验证知识相矛盾的输出。传统检索增强方法依赖静态源和浅层证据整合，无法基于准确且不断发展的知识进行生成。

Method: ORIG框架迭代地从网络检索和过滤多模态证据，逐步将精炼知识整合到增强提示中指导图像生成。

Result: 实验表明ORIG在事实一致性和整体图像质量方面显著优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: ORIG展示了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成方面的潜力，为解决多模态模型的事实准确性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

Method: 提出AesCrop模型，使用VMamba图像编码器，结合新颖的Mamba Composition Attention Bias机制和Transformer解码器，通过显式编码构图线索到注意力机制中，引导模型关注构图最显著的区域。

Result: 大量实验表明，AesCrop在定量指标上优于当前最先进方法，并能生成视觉上更令人愉悦的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过整合构图感知的注意力偏置机制，成功提升了图像裁剪的质量和多样性，在美学驱动的图像裁剪任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Motivation: 传统方法在感知混淆环境（如狭窄管道）中表现不佳，存在向量量化、特征稀疏和重复纹理等问题，而现有解决方案计算成本高。

Method: 引入词组概念捕捉视觉词的空间共现和邻近关系构建在线词典，结合概率转移模型将时间一致性融入相似度计算，并加入特征分布分析和后验证机制。

Conclusion: BoWG方法在闭环检测中实现了卓越的性能和计算效率，展现出优秀的可扩展性，适用于感知混淆环境。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the

TL;DR: 提出SRSR框架，通过空间重聚焦交叉注意力(SRCA)和空间目标无分类器引导(STCFG)解决扩散超分辨率中的语义模糊和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法存在语义模糊问题，主要原因是文本条件不准确不完整，以及交叉注意力容易偏离到无关像素，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 提出SRSR框架，包含两个核心组件：SRCA使用视觉分割掩码引导交叉注意力，STCFG选择性绕过未接地像素的文本影响以防止幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，SRSR在所有数据集的标准保真度指标(PSNR和SSIM)上均优于7个最先进基线，在真实基准测试的感知质量指标(LPIPS和DISTS)上也表现更好。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中有效实现了高语义保真度和感知质量，解决了现有方法的语义对齐问题。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个用于严格评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态细微变化能力的基准，包含三个任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面仍有困难，大多数开源模型在零样本设置下表现仅达到随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但它们识别物体状态的精确度仍不清楚。为了填补这一空白，需要建立一个严格的基准来评估VLMs理解物体状态细微变化的能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同时执行的任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。使用手工制作的图像对数据集，并构建了包含1300万半自动生成描述的STATUS Train训练数据集。

Result: 实验显示当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态差异方面表现不佳，大多数开源模型在零样本设置下仅达到随机水平。经过STATUS Train微调后，Qwen2.5-VL的性能可与Gemini 2.0 Flash相媲美。

Conclusion: STATUS Bench和STATUS Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展至关重要，当前VLMs在理解物体状态方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集、MVN-LF自监督任务和ORC损失函数，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决XLFM中基于学习的3D重建面临的两个核心挑战：缺乏标准化数据集和缺乏能有效建模角度-空间结构且保持物理基础的方法

Method: 1.构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；2.提出MVN-LF自监督任务，通过预测遮挡视图学习角度先验；3.设计ORC损失函数，强制预测体积与其PSF前向投影的对齐

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上，PSNR相比最先进基线提升了7.7%

Conclusion: 通过标准化数据集、自监督角度先验学习和物理约束的渲染一致性损失，显著推进了XLFM的3D重建能力

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: PFED是一个用于跨视角地理定位的高效框架，结合了层次知识蒸馏和多视角表示精炼，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角地理定位方法依赖资源密集的细粒度特征提取和对齐，多分支和多模块显著增加了推理成本，限制了在边缘设备上的部署。

Method: 提出PFED框架，包含两个关键组件：1)训练时的层次蒸馏范式HD-CVGL和不确定性感知预测对齐UAPA；2)推理时的多视角精炼模块MRM，利用互信息过滤冗余样本。

Result: 在University-1652数据集上达到97.15%的Recall@1，FLOPs效率提升5倍以上，速度提升3倍，在AGX Orin边缘设备上达到251.5 FPS。

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率方面都达到了最先进水平，证明了其在实时无人机应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个部分监督的自训练框架，用于多种视网膜疾病筛查，通过三分支架构处理标签缺失和领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖完全标注或单领域数据集的问题，处理多个部分标注数据集中的标签缺失和领域偏移挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：教师分支从弱增强图像生成伪标签处理缺失标签；两个学生分支分别使用低频丢弃(LF-Dropout)增强领域鲁棒性，以及低频不确定性(LF-Uncert)估计领域变异性。

Result: 在多个眼底数据集上的实验表明，PSScreen V2实现了最先进性能和优越的领域泛化能力，与不同骨干网络兼容，包括视觉基础模型DINOv2。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性和适应性，在胸部X光数据集上的评估也验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种投影嵌入扩散桥(PEDB)方法，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，在采样过程中同时考虑FBP重建和投影数据，自然融入数据一致性，显著提升CT图像重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散桥模型主要从FBP重建中恢复干净图像，但很少探索如何融入数据一致性。融入投影数据可以提高重建保真度和细节恢复能力。

Method: 提出PEDB方法，设计新的反向SDE来从干净图像分布中采样，条件化于FBP重建和投影数据。将投影数据嵌入到反向SDE的得分函数中，推导后验得分的可处理表达式，并引入参数控制随机性水平。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整数据类型的CT重建中，PEDB表现优异，在标准、噪声和域迁移评估中均优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式条件化投影数据自然融入数据一致性，在多种不完整数据场景下实现了高质量的CT图像重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SWAN是一个三阶段自监督小波神经网络，用于从高光谱图像中联合估计端元和丰度，通过小波变换和多尺度表示实现无监督解混。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高光谱解混方法需要地面真值，且难以处理连续重叠的波段信息。本文旨在开发一种无需真值的自监督学习方法，利用小波变换的稀疏多尺度表示来提升解混性能。

Method: 三阶段架构：SWANencoder将小波系数映射到低维潜在空间，SWANdecoder重建小波系数，SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。采用三阶段组合损失函数和Adam优化器，使用Sigmoid和dropout防止过拟合。

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量评估中优于现有神经网络解混方法，学习到了更具鲁棒性的解混函数。

Conclusion: SWAN通过自监督学习和小波变换实现了高效的高光谱解混，无需地面真值，网络参数紧凑，适合实际应用。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了跨物种迁移学习在奶牛姿态估计中的潜力与局限，发现尽管在相似分布数据上表现良好，但在未见过的牛舍和牛群中存在显著泛化失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业应用中缺乏大型标注的牲畜数据集，特别是奶牛，限制了计算机视觉在动物姿态、行为和福利理解方面的应用。

Method: 通过将基于视觉变换器的ZebraPose模型（在合成斑马图像上训练）适应于真实牛舍条件下的奶牛27关键点检测，使用三种配置（自定义农场数据集、APT-36K基准数据集子集及其组合）系统评估模型准确性和泛化能力。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87，PCK 0.5=0.869），但在应用于未见过的牛舍和牛群时出现显著泛化失败。

Conclusion: 合成到真实的领域差距是农业AI部署的主要障碍，物种间形态相似性不足以实现跨领域迁移，需要优先考虑农场级真实性、跨环境鲁棒性和开放基准数据集。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上产生高质量编辑，编辑时间比现有基准减少60%。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的语义编辑解决方案，通过分析预训练模型参数直接获得可解释的编辑方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

Conclusion: SARCLIP成功弥合了SAR图像与文本描述之间的鸿沟，为SAR领域提供了首个视觉语言基础模型，代码和数据集将公开发布。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统通过LiDAR-视觉融合和创新的表示方法，有效解决了大规模动态场景中的SLAM挑战，提高了重建鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Conclusion: 提出的无混叠ViT通过改进下采样和注意力机制，有效提升了ViT的平移不变性，同时保持了良好的分类性能。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在高清地图元素的高质量预测（高分类和定位分数）方面表现不佳，主要由于任务不对齐问题：1）不适当的任务标签（一对多匹配查询共享相同标签），2）次优的任务特征（任务共享采样机制）。

Method: DAMap包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失（DAFL）为多对一匹配样本分配适当分类标签，任务调制可变形注意力（TMDA）获取区分性任务特定特征，混合损失方案（HLS）更好地利用DAFL的优势。

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中，在不同指标、基线、分割、主干网络和训练计划下均实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，显著提高了高清地图元素预测的质量，为自动驾驶安全提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

*Hibiki Ayabe,Kazushi Okamoto,Koki Karube,Atsushi Shibata,Kei Harada*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于立面图像的多任务学习模型，预测日本建筑的结构防火等级，通过联合估计建筑年份、结构和类型，结合保险标准规则映射到H/T/M防火等级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本二手住房市场的关键建筑元数据（如建造年份和结构类型）经常缺失或过时，这影响了灾害风险评估和保险定价。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像联合预测建筑年份（回归）、建筑结构和物业类型（分类），然后基于官方保险标准通过规则映射推导结构防火等级。

Result: 模型在建筑年份回归和类别不平衡分类任务中均取得高准确率，定性分析显示模型能捕捉与建筑年龄和材料相关的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害准备方面具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SVG图像在数字设计和机器人控制中具有重要作用，但现有方法在生成交互式SVG方面存在局限性。需要开发一个能够处理多种输入信号并生成高质量SVG的统一框架。

Method: 提出RoboSVG框架：1）生成多模态引导；2）通过专用生成模块合成候选SVG；3）在数值引导下精炼SVG。构建了包含100万个样本的RoboDraw数据集，支持文本到SVG、图像到SVG、部分SVG到SVG和部分图像到SVG四种任务。

Conclusion: RoboSVG为交互式SVG生成提供了一个有效的多模态框架，数据集和源代码将公开发布以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.
The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

*Wenlong Li,Yifei Xu,Yuan Rao,Zhenhua Wang,Shuiguang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree是一种无需训练的视频异常检测方法，通过分层粒度感知树结构进行灵活采样，利用预训练模型的知识来识别不同时间跨度的异常事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个问题：监督方法需要大量训练数据且无法解释异常原因；无训练方法使用固定长度时间窗口采样，难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。

Method: 使用预训练的通用事件边界检测模型分解视频为事件节点，构建分层粒度感知树结构，通过视觉语言模型增强异常感知，利用大语言模型进行异常推理，最后整合多粒度异常分数。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，VADTree在无训练设置下达到最先进性能，同时大幅减少了采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过灵活的分层采样和预训练模型知识利用，有效解决了视频异常检测中不同时间跨度异常识别的问题，在减少计算成本的同时提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

TL;DR: 提出了Windsock和DANCE方法，通过动态检索决策和抗噪训练提升多模态检索增强生成的效果，在减少检索次数的同时显著提高生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、不灵活的模态选择和次优的信息利用问题，需要解决何时检索、选择什么模态以及如何有效利用检索信息这三个关键挑战

Method: 引入Windsock模块进行检索必要性和模态选择的决策，提出DANCE指令调优增强MLLMs利用检索信息的能力，采用自评估方法将问答数据集转换为MRAG训练数据集

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高生成质量17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了MRAG中的关键挑战，在提升响应质量的同时降低了计算开销

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveMAE是一个针对多光谱卫星图像的掩码自编码框架，通过离散小波变换和地理条件位置编码，在遥感任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感数据标注稀缺，完全监督方法适用性有限，需要开发自监督学习方法来构建遥感基础模型。

Method: 使用多级离散小波变换分离频率分量，引导编码器学习尺度感知的高频表示；提出地理条件位置编码，通过球谐函数整合地理先验知识。

Result: 在PANGAEA基准测试的多个下游任务中，WaveMAE相比现有方法获得了一致的改进，在分割和回归任务上提升显著；轻量版仅用26.4%参数就能达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE被确立为一个强大且具有地理信息感知的多光谱遥感基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT)，一个端到端的大型统一transformer，用于统一空间重建和实例级上下文理解的知识。通过3D一致性对比学习策略，仅使用2D视觉输入就能编码包含几何结构和实例聚类的统一表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类自然地将3D世界的几何结构和语义内容视为相互关联的维度，但现有方法通常将低层3D重建与高层空间理解分开处理，忽视了这两者之间的关键交互作用，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 设计3D一致性对比学习策略，指导IGGT仅通过2D视觉输入编码包含几何结构和实例聚类的统一表示。构建InsScene-15K大规模数据集，包含高质量RGB图像、位姿、深度图和3D一致的实例级掩码标注。

Result: 该表示支持将2D视觉输入一致地提升为具有明确不同对象实例的连贯3D场景。

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何重建和实例级理解，解决了现有方法在3D场景分析中的局限性，为下游3D理解任务提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Lipreading has emerged as an increasingly important research area for
developing robust speech recognition systems and assistive technologies for the
hearing-impaired. However, non-English resources for visual speech recognition

word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional

end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a
critical gap in low-resource languages, LRW-Persian enables rigorous

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，添加Transformer模块增强长距离依赖，并采用数据增强处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在单次实验中准确率达0.8961，精确率0.9160；通过4折交叉验证准确率达0.9755（标准差0.0031），优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 为DFU分类设定了新基准，提供了用于医学图像分析的混合注意力Transformer框架，并通过XAI方法确保决策过程的透明性和可信度。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP模型的零样本对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗训练即可在测试时防御对抗攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本场景下表现出色，但对对抗扰动高度脆弱。现有防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本设置中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个互补模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测，在对抗扰动下稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试和多种攻击设置下的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可无缝集成到其他VLM中获得进一步增益。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的巨大潜力，对更广泛的视觉语言领域如BioMedCLIP具有重要影响。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话人脸生成方法在时序一致性、身份保持和定制化方面存在不足，特别是在生成长视频时。

Method: 提出MAGIC-Talk框架，包含ReferenceNet（身份保持和文本编辑）和AnimateNet（运动一致性），采用渐进潜在融合策略提升长视频质量。

Result: 实验表明MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个鲁棒的解决方案，支持单图像身份保持和时序稳定的长视频生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,

*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用多模态LLM作为公平评判员来评估文本到图像系统的图像与提示的匹配度和社会属性处理，相比传统方法提供更可靠、可复现的公平性审计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I系统缺乏简单可复现的方法来评估图像与提示的匹配度和社会属性处理，传统代理方法（如人脸分类器和对比相似度）只关注表面线索，缺乏校准弃权机制，且无法识别弱可见属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）。

Method: 将指令跟随多模态LLM作为公平评判员，使用解释导向的评分标准映射到[-1,1]区间，约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾属性。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新构建的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。评判模型在人口统计预测上优于对比和人脸中心基线，提高平均对齐度同时保持高职业准确性。

Conclusion: FairJudge协议能够实现更可靠、可复现的公平性审计，相比仅使用CLIP的流程提供可问责、基于证据的决策，且不改变生成器本身，专注于评估公平性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Gemma-3 LLM的多模态融合系统，通过多模态投影整合视觉和文本特征，使用LoRA进行适配，用于预测商业广告记忆性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025竞赛中商业广告记忆性预测任务，探索LLM在多模态记忆性预测中的有效性。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干，整合预计算的ViT视觉特征和E5文本特征，采用多模态投影和LoRA适配，并引入LLM生成的基于专家记忆性方面的理性提示来指导融合模型。

Result: 基于LLM的系统在最终测试集上表现出比梯度提升树基线更强的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多模态融合方法在商业广告记忆性预测任务中优于传统机器学习方法，具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SP-CSVR框架解决LVLMs的"风格陷阱"问题，通过风格-内容解耦和语义对齐机制，实现跨风格视觉推理的稳定语义理解和自适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多样视觉风格下存在"风格陷阱"问题，特别是在上下文学习中，现有方法难以有效解耦风格与内容，阻碍了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出SP-CSVR框架，包含跨风格特征编码器(CSFE)用于风格-内容解耦，语义对齐上下文解码器(SAICD)用于少样本风格适应，以及自适应语义一致性模块(ASCM)通过多任务对比学习确保跨风格语义不变性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上的广泛实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应方面达到了最先进的性能。消融研究和泛化分析证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR通过增强跨风格视觉推理的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率，有效解决了LVLMs中的风格陷阱问题。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastJAM是一种基于图的快速联合图像对齐方法，通过图神经网络传播关键点对应关系，显著降低了计算复杂度，将处理时间从小时/分钟级缩短到秒级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合图像对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 利用现成图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过快速非参数聚类构建表示关键点关系的图，使用图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，通过图像级池化预测单应性参数，采用逆组合损失避免正则化项。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在配准质量上优于现有现代JA方法，同时将计算时间从小时/分钟级减少到秒级。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合图像对齐解决方案，显著提升了计算效率而不牺牲配准质量。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic Surgery框架，一种无需训练、零样本的概念擦除方法，直接在文本嵌入层面操作，通过向量减法消除目标概念影响，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型概念擦除方法往往会损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又能保持图像质量的方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前对文本嵌入进行操作，动态估计目标概念存在并进行校准的向量减法，包含共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环来处理多概念擦除和潜在概念持久性问题。

Result: 在物体、露骨内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，达到93.58 H-score的物体擦除效果，露骨内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery提供了一种实用的文本到图像生成安全解决方案，既能作为内置威胁检测系统，又能保持图像质量和局部性。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

*Yang Zhang,Qianyu Zhou,Farhad Imani,Jiong Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于检索增强生成(RAG)和视觉语言模型(VLM)的零样本风电叶片损伤检测框架，无需任务特定训练即可准确分类多种损伤类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。传统基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或新型损伤。

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词感知重排来组装最相关上下文，为VLM提供领域知识。

Result: 在30张标记叶片图像测试集上，RAG增强的VLM正确分类所有样本，而相同VLM无检索时准确率和精度均较差。框架在可解释性和泛化性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为工业检测提供了一种数据高效的解决方案，减少了对大量标注数据集的依赖，能够通过领域知识检测未见过的缺陷。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Conclusion: 该数据集为机器学习社区提供了牧草生物量估计的挑战任务，有助于促进精准畜牧业的发展。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Gen-LangSplat通过使用预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定的语言自编码器，解决了LangSplat方法中每个场景都需要训练自编码器的可扩展性问题，实现了高效的开源词汇3D语言场构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat虽然利用3D高斯泼溅高效构建3D语言场，但需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自编码器进行特征压缩，这造成了昂贵的逐场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署可扩展性。

Method: 用在大规模ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定的自编码器，使用固定的紧凑潜在空间来处理任何新场景的语言特征，无需场景特定训练。通过消融研究确定最佳潜在嵌入维度。

Result: 整个语言场构建过程效率显著提升，同时查询性能与原LangSplat方法相当或更好。通过MSE和余弦相似度验证了原始512维CLIP嵌入与重投影嵌入之间的表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开源词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互式3D AI应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PPE（位置保持嵌入）的新编码算子，在视觉令牌压缩过程中保持时空结构，解决了现有令牌合并方法破坏空间布局和时间连续性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但常因冗余视觉令牌导致效率低下。现有令牌合并方法虽然减少了序列长度，但忽略了位置关系，破坏了空间布局和时间连续性。

Method: PPE在令牌维度上显式引入3D位置的解耦编码，使每个压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置。支持级联聚类策略，实现渐进式令牌压缩。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，包括MMBench（通用视觉理解）、TextVQA（布局理解）和VideoMME（时间理解），PPE实现了2%~5%的持续改进。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效有效的MLLM推理至关重要，PPE作为一种参数无关的通用算子，可以无缝集成到现有令牌合并方法中。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在生成与文本提示完美对齐的图像方面存在困难，且现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么与人类评估相关性差，特别是忽略了同一类别中多个不同实例的复杂提示场景。

Method: 构建了大规模、多类别、多实例、多关系的M³T2IBench基准，设计了基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标，并提出了无需训练的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法来提升图像-文本对齐。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在这个具有挑战性的基准上表现不佳，而提出的Revise-Then-Enforce方法在广泛的扩散模型中都能改善图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore指标能有效评估复杂场景下的图像-文本对齐，Revise-Then-Enforce方法为提升文本到图像生成的对齐性提供了有效的训练后解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了生物特征统计不相关的传统假设，通过双编码器网络在指纹-指纹、虹膜-虹膜以及跨模态指纹-虹膜匹配任务上进行验证，发现同个体的左右虹膜存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战生物特征统计不相关的传统假设，验证不同生物特征之间是否存在相关性。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer作为双编码器网络骨干，在274名受试者的约10万张指纹和7千张虹膜图像上训练，通过对比损失最小化同一受试者图像间的差异。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC，证明同个体左右虹膜相关；指纹模型重现了先前研究的正相关结果；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果继续挑战生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征，需要更多数据和更复杂的流程来获得有说服力的跨模态匹配结果。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive

TL;DR: 提出了一种可切换的令牌特定码本量化方法，用于人脸图像压缩，通过为不同图像类别学习不同的码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，在低比特率下提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的解决方案使用全局共享码本进行量化和反量化，但忽略了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性和令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低每个码本组大小的同时减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像的平均识别准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，在低比特率下显著提升了人脸图像的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

Conclusion: 通过战略性地融合公开可用的专用模型，可以更高效地实现竞争性多模态性能，为统一多模态建模的未来研究提供支持。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: FAME是一种公平性感知的视频编辑方法，通过注意力调制技术缓解职业相关的性别偏见，同时保持提示对齐和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，需要解决职业相关的性别偏见问题。

Method: FAME从现有少数群体表示中推导公平性嵌入，通过软注入去偏置令牌到文本编码器。同时集成公平性调制到时间自注意力和提示到区域的交叉注意力中，使用区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减权重来增强区域内一致性。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试上的广泛实验表明，FAME在公平性对齐和语义保真度方面表现优异，超越了现有的视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME通过公平性感知的注意力调制技术，有效缓解了视频编辑中的职业性别偏见，同时保持了良好的时间一致性和语义保真度。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择来保持DDIM反演中的时间一致性，这会引入人为偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA使用变分框架和对比学习目标，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保持内容和时间一致性的潜在锚点。

Result: 在真实世界视频编辑基准测试中，VALA在反演保真度、编辑质量和时间一致性方面达到最先进性能，同时比先前方法更高效。

Conclusion: VALA通过变分对齐有效解决了训练无关视频编辑中的时间一致性问题，提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

Motivation: 解决现有占用中心方法对标注占用数据的依赖问题，当前这类数据仍然稀缺，限制了生成模型的性能。

Method: 采用时空解耦架构支持4D动态占用的高保真空间扩展和时间预测；提出基于高斯泼溅的稀疏点图渲染策略增强多视角视频生成；使用传感器感知嵌入策略显式建模LiDAR传感器特性。

Conclusion: 通过构建大规模数据集和统一框架，成功实现了高质量的驾驶场景多模态生成，为自动驾驶下游应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

Conclusion: SceneDecorator通过解决场景规划和一致性挑战，为创意领域提供了更强大的故事生成能力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

### [153] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一个可微分即插即用模块，通过学习混合多尺度解码器logits并优化损失权重，提升U形网络的性能，无需推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U形网络训练方法要么只监督最终高分辨率logits，要么对所有尺度应用相同的深度监督，没有探索混合尺度组合，导致解码器输出缺乏粗细预测融合的互补线索。

Method: 引入LoMix模块，使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、连接、注意力加权融合）混合多尺度解码器logits，生成丰富的合成突变图，通过softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化，实现自动发现最有用的尺度、混合和算子。

Result: 在Synapse 8器官数据集上，LoMix比单输出监督提高DICE 4.2%，比深度监督提高2.2%，比等权重加法融合提高1.5%，在数据稀缺时优势更明显（+9.23%）。在四个基准测试中，DICE最高提升13.5%。

Conclusion: 可学习的加权混合尺度融合具有广泛泛化能力，同时保持数据效率、完全可解释性和零推理开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成的组合运动定制框架，能够在一个视频中合成多个不同的运动，解决了现有方法在复杂多主体运动控制方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型在生成多样化场景方面表现出色，但在精确运动控制方面存在困难，特别是在处理复杂多主体运动时。虽然已有单运动定制方法，但在组合场景中由于运动-外观纠缠和无效的多运动混合而失败。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：1）单运动学习阶段，通过静态-动态解耦调优范式将运动与外观分离，学习运动特定模块；2）多运动组合阶段，通过即插即用的分治策略在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响，无需额外训练即可组合学习到的运动。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CoMo实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。作者还引入了新的基准测试和评估指标来评估多运动保真度和混合效果。

Conclusion: CoMo框架有效解决了文本到视频生成中的组合运动定制问题，通过解耦学习和空间隔离策略成功实现了多运动的精确控制，为可控视频生成开辟了新方向。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出了统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个核心组件，显著提升点云压缩质量，在多个数据集上大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云的有损压缩会不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要解决压缩后的质量恢复问题。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个组件：基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net进行后几何增强，增强几何引导的重新着色策略进行前属性增强，以及属性残差预测网络进行后属性增强。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB数据集上显著优于现有方法，相比G-PCC测试模型，几何BD-PSNR提升9.98dB，属性Y分量BD-PSNR提升3.67dB，比特率节省分别达到90.98%和56.88%。

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效提升了点云压缩的质量，在几何和属性恢复方面都取得了显著改进，同时大幅降低了比特率。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型存在计算密集和样本多样性有限的问题，需要更高效的图像生成方法。

Method: 使用嵌套自回归架构，构建层次化的多尺度模块，每个大尺度模块基于前一个小尺度模块的输出，并在模块内使用AR结构生成token块，结合流匹配损失和连续token。

Result: 在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: NestAR模型通过创新的嵌套架构有效解决了自回归模型的计算效率和多样性问题。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一个用于视频时序定位的分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和对比损失函数，在长视频中保持时间结构并实现精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时，由于过度下采样或依赖固定窗口，往往牺牲时间保真度，无法同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节。

Method: 使用分层架构和Anchor-MambaPooling块，利用Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度锚点标记，结合锚点条件和段池化对比损失来保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到了新的最先进水平，展示了在长未修剪视频中的精确时间定位能力。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和对比学习策略，有效解决了长视频时序定位中的时间保真度问题，实现了更精确的时间边界定位。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Motivation: 在机器人辅助微创手术中，从内窥镜视频进行准确的3D重建对下游任务和改善手术结果至关重要。但内窥镜场景存在光度不一致、非刚性组织运动和视角相关高光等独特挑战，仅依赖外观约束的3DGS方法往往不足。

Method: 1. 采用统一的时空高斯表示，直接在4D域中优化基元；2. 提出基于光流的几何约束来增强时间一致性并有效约束场景的3D结构；3. 提出多分辨率有理正交小波作为约束，能有效分离内窥镜细节并增强渲染性能。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的动态视觉伪影问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

*Hebaixu Wang,Jing Zhang,Haoyang Chen,Haonan Guo,Di Wang,Jiayi Ma,Bo Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出残差扩散桥模型(RDBM)，通过理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，利用残差调制噪声注入和去除过程，实现退化区域的自适应修复并保护未退化区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除重构图像会扭曲未退化区域。需要一种能自适应修复退化区域同时保护完好区域的方法。

Method: 理论重构广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，推导其前向和反向过程的解析公式，利用给定分布的残差来调制噪声注入和去除过程。

Result: 在多种图像修复任务中，该方法在定性和定量上都展现出最先进的性能，并实证证明了所提模型的最优性。

Conclusion: RDBM为现有桥模型提供了统一的数学本质解释，所有现有方法都是RDBM的特例，该方法在图像修复任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间序列和图像数据融合的挑战，探索跨模态生成能力，并提升下游任务的性能表现。

Method: 采用确定性和学习策略进行时间序列量化，利用掩码相关性学习目标，在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。

Result: 在地球观测领域的应用中，预训练模型能够从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，并在下游任务中平均优于任务特定融合方法6%的R²和2%的RMSE，超越基线方法50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关的预训练框架在多模态融合中表现出色，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型稳健性的见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一个基于深度学习的谱迁移框架，通过知识蒸馏和新型谱适应单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率信息迁移到卫星高光谱传感中，实现无需大量地面采样的准确大尺度盐度估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐渍化严重威胁生态系统和农业，实验室光谱精度高但难以扩展到大尺度，卫星高光谱可大范围观测但缺乏精细解释性，需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏和谱适应单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率信息迁移到卫星高光谱数据中，实现领域自适应。

Result: 在综合实证基准测试中，DeepSalt相比无明确领域自适应的方法取得显著性能提升，能有效泛化到未见地理区域，解释大部分盐度方差。

Conclusion: DeepSalt通过谱迁移框架成功解决了实验室与卫星光谱之间的尺度差距，为大尺度盐度监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

TL;DR: 本文从总最小二乘法角度统一了两种结构张量构造方法，证明了Granlund和Knutsson 1995的校正项不必要，简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种结构张量构造方法之间的理论联系，寻求统一的理论框架。

Method: 通过总最小二乘法线拟合功率谱的视角分析两种结构张量构造方法，证明它们可以在统一框架下理解。

Result: 发现Granlund和Knutsson 1995的校正项不必要，省略后可确保张量保持半正定性，简化特征值解释，并允许使用非正交滤波器和非角度分割。

Conclusion: 两种结构张量构造方法在总最小二乘法框架下可统一理解，校正项可省略，这简化了张量解释并扩展了滤波器选择灵活性。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法从3D参考点生成对象查询，但有些参考点远离目标物体，容易导致误检。

Method: 使用深度引导的查询生成器，结合深度信息和2D检测来采样参考点；引入混合注意力机制，融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%。

Conclusion: DQ3D方法通过深度引导的查询生成和混合注意力机制，有效提升了3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Motivation: 现有方法难以准确评估具有多样化架构、训练策略和任务对齐的新兴预训练模型的可迁移性，而可迁移性评估对于选择最佳预训练模型和推进预训练-微调范式至关重要。

Method: 提出了隐式可迁移性建模(ITM)框架，结合分治变分近似(DVA)策略来高效近似嵌入空间的演化过程。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和多种模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM框架能够更准确地评估预训练模型的可迁移性，为模型选择和部署提供了更可靠的指导。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应门控融合(AG-Fusion)方法，用于在传感器退化或环境干扰的挑战性场景中实现鲁棒的多模态3D目标检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相机-LiDAR融合方法在传感器退化或环境干扰的挑战性场景中性能显著下降，需要更鲁棒的融合策略。

Method: 首先将各模态特征投影到统一的BEV空间，使用基于窗口的注意力机制增强特征，然后设计基于跨模态注意力的自适应门控融合模块来整合特征。

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在新建的E3D数据集上比基线方法提升24.88%，在复杂工业场景中表现出对不可靠模态信息的优越鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion方法能够选择性整合跨模态知识，在复杂场景中实现鲁棒的3D目标检测，特别是在具有挑战性的工业环境中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Result: 该方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确的对应关系，并成功应用于轨迹和路径点传递。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本、开放词汇3D场景类比方法能够有效连接不同3D场景，支持机器人演示传递和任务规划迁移。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在零样本异常动作识别中的空间推理能力，通过将视频转换为文本描述并使用文本蕴含来评分，评估了四种开源模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄像头广泛使用产生了海量视频数据，远超人工监控能力，这给公共安全带来挑战。需要开发能够识别异常事件的智能体，其核心在于空间推理能力。

Method: 将异常动作识别构建为零样本、基于语言的任务，通过预训练的视觉-LLM将视频转换为文本描述，使用文本蕴含对标签进行评分。评估了四种模型在提示和隐私保护条件下的表现。

Result: 少量样本提示可以提升某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报。隐私过滤器（特别是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性降低准确性。模型在简单、空间显著事件上表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份混淆时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。零样本、基于语言的流程可作为实际视频理解的适应性构建模块。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个基于DECO框架的三分支网络，用于改进人体与物体接触预测，通过双DINOv2编码器、类别平衡损失权重和补丁级交叉注意力机制，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DECO模型在野外人体-物体接触预测中存在局限性：只能生成二元接触图，在软表面、遮挡、儿童和假阳性脚部接触方面表现不佳。需要更准确、语义丰富的接触预测方法。

Method: 使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器构建三分支网络，采用类别平衡损失权重减少偏差，使用补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，最后通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：二元接触F1分数提升7%，测地误差减半，增加了对象级语义标签预测。消融研究表明LoRA微调和双编码器是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: DecoDINO在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基线模型，证明了其在人体-物体接触预测方面的有效性，特别是在处理复杂场景和语义标签方面表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶在面对不同相机视角时缺乏鲁棒性，这是现实世界中由于车辆配置多样性带来的常见挑战。

Method: 采用前馈推理策略，引入视角混合记忆库促进多视角间的时间交互，以及视角一致性蒸馏策略从原始视图向合成视图传递知识。

Conclusion: VR-Drive是端到端自动驾驶系统在现实世界部署中可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，能有效支持临床诊断和教育。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了最先进的深度伪造检测器在摩尔纹影响视频上的表现，发现摩尔纹伪影会使检测性能下降高达25.4%，而去摩尔纹方法反而使问题恶化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测在现实世界中的挑战，特别是智能手机从数字屏幕拍摄媒体时引入的摩尔纹伪影会扭曲检测结果，这一问题此前很少受到关注。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频的数据集，涵盖多个数据集，并在不同现实条件下拍摄；使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成摩尔纹生成技术进行额外实验；评估了15个顶级检测器。

Result: 摩尔纹伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成生成的摩尔纹模式导致准确率下降21.4%；去摩尔纹方法反而使准确率下降高达17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够鲁棒处理摩尔纹失真的检测模型，并引入DMF数据集以推动未来研究弥合受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 提出Eruku方法，将手写文本生成重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，通过特殊文本标记和分类器自由引导策略，解决了现有自回归方法需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制和内容控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在手写文本生成中存在需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、容易产生重复循环和视觉伪影等问题，需要改进内容可控性。

Method: 将手写文本生成重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计基于分类器自由引导的自回归模型策略。

Result: 相比先前解决方案，Eruku方法需要更少输入，对未见风格具有更好泛化能力，并能更忠实地遵循文本提示，提高了内容一致性。

Conclusion: Eruku方法通过重新制定自回归框架和引入多模态提示条件生成，有效解决了手写文本生成中的内容控制问题，在风格保真度和内容一致性方面表现优异。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

TL;DR: 提出渐进式增大图像块尺寸的自动课程学习方法，用于3D医学图像分割，能在减少训练时间的同时提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统固定图像块尺寸方法在训练效率和类别不平衡问题上的不足，特别是对于高度不平衡的病变分割任务。

Method: 在模型训练过程中逐步增大图像块尺寸，通过两种模式（资源高效模式和性能模式）进行训练，改善类别平衡并加速收敛。

Result: 资源高效模式将训练时间减少至44%的同时保持相同性能；性能模式在15个任务上均超越基线，平均Dice分数提升1.28%，训练时间减少至89%。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的输入数据变换方法能显著提升分割性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Shapley值的特征归因和模态评分方法，分析6个不同上下文长度的视觉语言模型在4个多选视频问答数据集上的表现，发现模型过度依赖文本且任务退化为忽略干扰项的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在视频问答中的广泛应用，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和方向正确性，特别是关注文本主导问题和模态间交互的探索不足。

Method: 使用Shapley值计算特征归因和模态评分，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选视频问答任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本的依赖性强，多选视频问答任务实际上退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在视频问答中存在文本主导问题，需要更平衡的多模态交互评估方法。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Motivation: 现实世界物体具有自然分层结构，传统平面分类方法忽略了这种层次关系，分层分类能提供更好的上下文理解并控制错误严重程度。

Method: 基于YOLO模型家族构建端到端分层模型，引入新颖的分层架构、改进的损失函数和专门的分层性能评估指标。

Result: 在两种不同分层分类的数据集上训练和评估，结果表明该方法能有效处理现实世界物体的固有分层结构。

Conclusion: 所提出的分层方法能够解决传统平面分类算法经常忽略的层次结构问题，提供更好的分类性能。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: AdaSDE是一种新颖的单步SDE求解器，通过可学习的系数动态调节误差校正强度，在有限步数下实现高效的扩散采样，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODE和SDE求解器在扩散生成过程中存在互补弱点：ODE求解器沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，而SDE方法在步数有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 提出AdaSDE单步SDE求解器，引入每步可学习系数，通过轻量级蒸馏估计，动态调节误差校正强度以加速扩散采样。该框架可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5NFE下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到FID 4.18，FFHQ上8.05，LSUN Bedroom上6.96，表现优异。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差鲁棒性，在有限步数下实现了高效的扩散采样性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺检测研究主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模真实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，进行针对性跨图像序列建模以捕捉潜在图像间联系；引入基于文本-图像对应关系的相关性引导细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0被证明是有效可靠的基准，能更好反映真实世界条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CIRM模型在单图像和多图像场景下都表现出有效性，为多模态讽刺检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的任意模态到任意模态的图像级重识别框架，通过解耦模态共享特征和模态特定特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题，查询图像和库图像来自不同传感器（如RGB、NIR、TIR），而现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了在实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 提出MDReID框架，包含两个关键组件：模态解耦学习（MDL）将模态特征显式分解为模态共享和模态特定表示；模态感知度量学习（MML）通过强制两个分量的正交性和互补性来增强跨模态的判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上的实验表明，MDReID在模态匹配场景下分别获得9.8%、3.0%和11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景下平均获得3.4%、11.8%和10.9%的增益。

Conclusion: MDReID通过有效解耦模态特征，在模态匹配和不匹配场景下都表现出优越性能，为实际应用中的多模态重识别问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

TL;DR: ReconViaGen通过将重建先验整合到生成框架中，解决了多视图3D重建中因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致的完整性问题，利用扩散模型的生成能力来补全不可见部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多视图的3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图之间的充分重叠，但在实践中经常因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致严重的不完整重建。扩散式3D生成技术虽然能通过学习生成先验来补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen，创新性地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，设计了多个策略来解决扩散式3D生成方法的两个主要问题：(a)在提取多视图图像特征作为条件时构建和利用跨视图连接的不足；(b)局部细节生成时迭代去噪的差可控性导致与输入不一致的几何和纹理细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReconViaGen能够在全局结构和局部细节上重建与输入视图一致的完整且准确的3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen成功地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，有效解决了多视图3D重建中的完整性和一致性问题，实现了高质量的重建结果。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning
in medical imaging.

label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance

TL;DR: 提出了PlanarTrack，一个用于平面跟踪的大规模高质量基准数据集，包含1,150个序列、超过733K帧，支持短期和长期跟踪评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但由于缺乏大规模平台，其发展受到限制。

Method: 创建了包含1,150个序列的大规模数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个视频帧通过四角点手动标注，并经过多轮精细检查和优化。

Result: 评估了10个代表性平面跟踪器，发现即使在顶级跟踪器上，在PlanarTrack上的性能也大幅下降，表明需要更多改进努力。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化和最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，为未来研究提供了比较基准。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: VideoTG-R1是一个用于视频时间定位的课程强化学习框架，通过边界反射代理和难度估计代理解决部分标注样本和难定位样本的问题，在仅使用10%训练数据和21%计算预算的情况下超越全数据方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法在视频时间定位中忽视了训练样本质量和难度问题：部分标注样本引入模糊监督，难定位样本在强化学习中产生低且不可区分的奖励，阻碍学习效率。

Method: 提出边界反射代理利用MLLM预测标注区间外的相关时间戳来过滤部分标注样本；引入难度估计代理评估样本训练难度，设计课程RL策略动态掩码难定位样本的视频内容。

Result: 在VTG和基于视频的问答任务上验证有效性，仅用10%训练样本和21%计算预算，在GRPO和SFT下均超越全数据对应方法。

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过解决训练样本质量和难度问题，实现了数据高效的视频时间定位训练，显著提升了性能和学习效率。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at
https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

TL;DR: BrainFound是一个基于DINO-v2的自监督基础模型，专门用于脑部MRI分析。它通过整合3D体积信息，支持单模态和多模态输入，在疾病检测和图像分割等任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学影像分析依赖大量标注数据，而脑部MRI分析通常面临标注稀缺和多模态数据整合的挑战。需要开发能够从大规模无标签数据中学习通用特征的基础模型。

Method: 扩展DINO-v2视觉变换器，将其从2D自然图像适应到3D脑部MRI分析。通过整合连续MRI切片的体积信息，支持单模态和多模态输入。

Result: BrainFound在标签稀缺和多对比度设置下，始终优于现有的自监督预训练策略和监督基线方法。通过整合多种3D MRI模态信息，提高了诊断准确性并减少对专家标注的依赖。

Conclusion: BrainFound为3D神经影像分析提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案，具有显著的临床部署和研究创新潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对低光条件建模不完整，导致下游任务性能受限。通过重新审视低光图像形成机制，扩展经典Lambertian模型来更好表征低光条件。

Method: 在频域分析中证明频域通道比可用于提取光照不变特征，提出FRBNet模块，集成频域通道比操作与可学习频域滤波器，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在多个下游任务中取得优异性能，包括暗光目标检测提升2.2 mAP，夜间分割提升2.9 mIoU。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中，有效提升低光条件下各种视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的工作流程，用于高效准确地将大规模移动激光扫描点云配准到目标模型点云，特别针对城市街道场景的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市环境中点云密度、噪声特征和遮挡场景变化带来的挑战，这些在繁华城市中心很常见。

Method: 引入两种方法：Semi-sphere Check预处理技术通过识别相互正交的平面表面优化分割MLS轨迹数据；Planar Voxel-based GICP精细配准方法在体素分区内有选择地利用平面表面。

Result: 在慕尼黑内城真实数据集上的实验表明，该工作流程实现了亚0.01米的平均配准精度，同时显著缩短处理时间，比传统点对面ICP方法减少50%以上的计算时间。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在推进自动化3D城市建模和更新方面具有潜力，可直接应用于城市规划、基础设施管理和动态城市监测。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD逆向工程中存在局限：自底向上方法无法生成完全参数化输出，自顶向下方法忽略细粒度几何细节，且都忽视了草图级约束这一CAD建模的关键要素。

Method: 受人类设计师手动操作启发，利用多平面截面提取2D模式，更有效地捕捉精细参数细节。

Result: 能够重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型，性能优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法首次在CAD逆向工程中直接整合了草图约束，为CAD模型重建提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析面临高质量标注样本稀缺和类别分布不均衡的挑战，传统迁移学习在类别分布不规则时效果下降。

Method: 使用基于样本分解粒度的课程学习策略训练通用无标签样本，并在下游任务中采用类别分解方法处理类别分布不均衡问题。

Conclusion: CURVETE模型能有效提升医学图像分类性能，特别是在样本有限和类别分布不均衡的情况下表现出色。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链存在视觉信息不准确的问题，提出了SCCM学习策略来提升视觉推理的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-文本多模态思维链虽然能产生正确答案，但视觉信息往往不准确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性，这源于强化微调中只激励格式而不考虑视觉信息正确性的奖励机制。

Method: 提出SCCM学习策略，鼓励生成足够但最小化的视觉组件，这些组件能独立导向正确答案；该方法无需标注且可与各种强化微调方法即插即用。

Result: 实验结果表明SCCM在多个细粒度感知和推理基准上持续提升了视觉忠实度。

Conclusion: SCCM方法有效解决了多模态思维链中视觉信息不可靠和不充分的问题，显著提升了视觉推理的忠实性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"图像思维"方法在图像推理中表现出色，但尚未扩展到视频推理任务。视频推理需要更复杂的动态推理能力。

Method: 构建Video-Thinker-10K数据集，采用监督微调学习推理格式，然后使用组相对策略优化强化推理能力，让模型自主执行定位和描述任务。

Result: Video-Thinker在领域内任务和具有挑战性的领域外视频推理基准测试中均取得显著性能提升，Video-Thinker-7B在7B规模MLLMs中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Video-Thinker成功将动态推理范式扩展到视频领域，证明了MLLMs能够自主利用内在能力进行视频推理，无需外部工具支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界数据集通常局限于单一交叉路口或单一车辆，缺乏多车辆和多路口场景，导致算法容易过拟合，在相似路口布局和交通参与者行为下产生误导性高性能。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特的三个城市交叉路口部署传感器，收集34个时间对齐、空间校准的20秒传感器序列，包含2辆车和最多3个基础设施传感器杆的协调场景数据。

Result: 数据集包含12个车载RGB相机、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像相机和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据，以10Hz频率标注13个对象类别的3D边界框，共约712k标注实例。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了多车辆、多路口协同感知数据集的空白，提供了完整的评估基准、代码库、高清地图和数据采集环境的数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix是一种训练时增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练，在监督微调和强化学习之间架起桥梁，提升多模态大语言模型的视觉-语言对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言对齐方法存在局限性：监督微调需要大规模人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，强化学习虽然引入奖励信号但存在开销大和不稳定的问题。需要平衡可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量。

Method: 1. 通过token合并实现注意力感知的图像混合，增强聚类表示和空间上下文；2. 使用混合图像和原始图像构建偏好对；3. 通过SimPO损失进行优化，实现偏好驱动训练。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，实现了竞争性的准确率和改进的效率，增强了注意力一致性和效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，在监督微调和强化学习之间建立了有效桥梁。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Conclusion: 通过纯文本教师模型进行在线蒸馏时，通过监督微调进行冷启动对齐至关重要，没有充分分布对齐会导致在线蒸馏无法提供有效指导。

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a

data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iPac提出了一种新的图像图表示方法，通过整合补丁分割、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等阶段，增强图神经网络在医学图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络在图像分类中未能充分考虑视觉实体间的底层结构和关系，限制了其在图像处理中的性能表现。

Method: iPac整合了补丁分割、特征提取、聚类、图构建和图学习等多个阶段，通过捕捉相关特征并组织成簇来构建有意义的图表示。

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升高达5%。

Conclusion: iPac通过利用图表示并考虑视觉实体间的固有结构和关系，为图像分类特别是医学图像分类提供了一个通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse是一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA，利用交叉注意力层权重动态生成主体掩码，实现高质量的多主体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖预推理的LoRA权重合并，要么需要分割模型和复杂的噪声混合技术来隔离LoRA输出，这些方法复杂且效率低下。

Method: 通过分析交叉注意力层权重自动生成上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中直接将这些掩码应用于LoRA输出，无需额外训练或修改LoRA。

Result: FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中，在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法，且无需额外训练、模型修改或用户定义的提示模板。

Conclusion: FreeFuse提供了一种实用高效的多主体生成解决方案，仅需用户提供LoRA激活词即可无缝集成到标准工作流程中。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

TL;DR: 提出动态伪标签过滤方案和数据增强管道，提升点云语义分割中无标签数据的利用率，在合成到真实点云任务中取得优越性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界LiDAR点云标注成本高，现有无监督域自适应方法未能有效利用无标签数据，依赖固定置信度阈值导致性能欠佳

Method: 动态伪标签过滤(DPLF)方案、先验引导数据增强管道(PG-DAP)、数据混合一致性损失

Result: 在两个合成到真实点云语义分割任务中实现优越性能，消融研究证实DPLF和PG-DAP模块的有效性

Conclusion: 所提方法能有效提升点云语义分割中无标签数据的利用率，缓解域偏移问题

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前多模态大语言模型在自我中心视频推理中的局限性，这些模型擅长可见事件推理但缺乏具身的第一人称理解能力。

Method: 1) 构建EgoRe-5M大规模自我中心问答数据集；2) 使用监督微调SFT和强化微调RFT两阶段学习；3) 通过时空思维链监督增强推理能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功提升了多模态大语言模型在自我中心视频推理中的能力，特别是在推断隐藏意图和识别细粒度交互方面。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

TL;DR: MERGE是一个统一模型，既能进行图像生成又能进行深度估计，通过可插拔转换器实现模式切换，同时保持预训练文本到图像模型的原始能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型的图像生成能力严重退化，需要解决这一矛盾。

Method: 提出play-and-plug框架，通过简单可插拔转换器实现图像生成和深度估计模式的无缝切换；引入组重用机制提高可学习参数的利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持了预训练模型的图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅能生成图像，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE框架成功释放了这种潜力。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性锚点，解决音频驱动人体动画中身份漂移问题，无需额外关键帧生成阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移，现有解决方案需要额外关键帧生成阶段且可能限制自然运动动态。

Method: 使用未来时间步的关键帧作为前瞻锚点，模型在响应即时音频线索的同时持续追踪这些未来锚点，实现自我关键帧化，参考图像直接作为前瞻目标。

Result: 应用于三个最新人体动画模型后，在唇部同步、身份保持和视觉质量方面表现优异，时间前瞻距离自然控制表达性与一致性的平衡。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring方法通过改进时间条件化，在多种架构上实现了更好的身份一致性和运动自然度。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续自回归建模在视觉像素数据上遇到的序列过长和高维空间问题，同时保持自回归模型在似然估计方面的优势。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，通过自监督维度减少方案分离信息性和冗余性通道，并设计一步蒸馏方案加速推理。

Result: 在像素级生成模型中取得竞争性性能，同时提供精确似然估计和可扩展训练。

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，为像素级生成建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

TL;DR: 提出了InFlux基准数据集，为具有动态相机内参的视频提供逐帧真值内参标注，包含143K+标注帧和386个高分辨率视频，解决了现有基准缺乏动态内参变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但现实视频中内参经常动态变化。现有基准缺乏场景多样性和内参变化，且没有提供连续视频帧的逐帧内参变化。

Method: 构建了全面的校准实验查找表，扩展了Kalibr工具箱以提高精度和鲁棒性，创建了包含室内外视频的基准数据集。

Result: InFlux基准捕获了更广泛的内参变化和场景多样性，包含143K+标注帧和386个高分辨率视频。评估发现现有方法在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测。

Conclusion: InFlux基准填补了动态相机内参基准的空白，为研究动态内参变化提供了重要资源，现有方法在该任务上表现不佳，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于谜题的视觉挑战基准，用于评估模型推理过程而非仅关注最终答案准确性。它要求模型在包含一个错误的逐步推理链中识别第一个错误步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注最终答案准确性，而忽略了推理过程的逻辑一致性。需要一种能够诊断模型推理能力的方法来开发可信赖的多模态大语言模型。

Method: 创建包含多步骤符号、几何和类比推理的视觉谜题，每个谜题配有一个包含一个错误的逐步推理链，要求模型识别第一个错误步骤。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在流畅生成和忠实推理之间存在持续差距，模型能产生看似合理的推理链但经常无法定位简单的逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench通过将答案生成与推理验证分离，为多模态推理能力提供了更清晰的评估视角，强调了在开发可信赖模型时需要诊断性评估协议。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景级理解，忽视了细粒度的对象中心推理需求。

Method: 提出尺度自适应对象分词器(SAOT)从自由形式区域生成对象表示，设计Object-Centric Infusion模块将全局上下文预融合到对象token中，创建轻量级Object-Only框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以较少训练样本实现领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架在细粒度视觉理解方面表现出色，其轻量级变体在效率和准确性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Motivation: 受人类通过多感官协同学习抽象概念的启发，一旦形成概念表征，通常可以从单一模态中回忆。

Method: 结合3D模态内自蒸馏与2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入，还开发了针对视频提升点云空间理解的变体，以及将表征线性投影到CLIP语言空间的翻译器。

Result: 在线性探测3D场景感知中，分别优于独立的SOTA 2D和3D自监督模型14.2%和4.8%，以及它们的特征拼接。在完全微调下，在多个场景理解基准测试中创下新SOTA（如ScanNet上80.7% mIoU）。

Conclusion: Concerto产生了具有优越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表征，支持开放世界感知。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

TL;DR: 政策优化算法在开放式的思维链结构中倾向于选择最简单的路径，丢弃显式推理，直接生成答案，即使复杂格式被赋予更高的奖励权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究政策优化在放松严格思维链格式约束后的行为，探索其在开放式思维链结构中的表现。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验和奖励分解实验，分析不同模型和算法在灵活推理-回答交错结构中的行为。

Result: 政策优化始终遵循最小阻力路径，学习丢弃显式推理，退化为直接答案格式，即使复杂格式奖励权重高达4倍。

Conclusion: 给予政策偏离自由是一把双刃剑：虽然有助于发现高奖励捷径，但也创造了博弈奖励函数最简单方面的强大激励，这对对齐中的奖励黑客构成了关键挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注输出分布优化，而忽视了将分布转换为最终响应的解码过程。现有方法如奖励模型计算成本高且适用性有限。

Method: 将解码过程类比推荐系统排序阶段，提出Language Ranker框架，使用基础模型提取特征，通过轻量级模块对候选响应进行重排。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，展示了充分释放LLM潜力的潜力，为解码过程优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性之间的对齐度，发现正确预测更支持特征，错误预测更矛盾特征，揭示了LLM解释的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释AI的需求日益增长。虽然LLM能生成自然语言解释，但这些解释是否真实反映决策依据尚不清楚。

Method: 提出RACE框架，通过token匹配、精确字符串匹配和编辑距离匹配技术，在四个文本分类数据集上比较LLM解释与逻辑回归特征重要性。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测覆盖更多支持特征，错误预测覆盖更多矛盾特征。编辑距离匹配发现释义重叠，提高了覆盖率但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表层和灵活的证据重用，但在错误情况下也可能放大误导性线索。RACE为评估神经语言模型推理完整性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过选择基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性的安全示例，有效缓解大语言模型在良性数据微调时的安全行为遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在良性数据微调时经常出现安全行为遗忘现象，现有方法使用随机安全示例效果有限，需要更有效的示例选择策略。

Method: 采用行为感知采样框架，基于指令-响应行为（如拒绝vs遵从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性来选择安全示例。

Result: 该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持帮助性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现高达41%的有害性降低。

Conclusion: 定向数据选择能够在大规模微调中提高安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义各向同性的方法来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，通过计算嵌入向量的角度分散度来预测事实一致性，无需标注数据或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要准确回答开放问题的关键应用领域部署LLM时，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估长文本响应的可信度，现有基于逐条事实核查的方法计算昂贵且脆弱。

Method: 引入语义各向同性概念，通过生成多个长文本响应并计算其嵌入向量在单位球面上的角度分散度来评估可信度，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择。

Result: 发现更高的语义各向同性（更大的嵌入分散度）可靠地表示样本间的事实一致性较低，该方法在多个领域始终优于现有方法预测长文本响应中的非事实性。

Conclusion: 该方法为将信任评估集成到实际LLM工作流程中提供了一种实用、低成本的解决方案，仅需少量样本即可有效预测长文本响应的可信度。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大规模网络配置复杂，传统基于领域特定语言的方法学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限，而自然语言接口更易访问和解释。

Method: 提出树形配置分块策略保持语义连贯性，构建统一事实图标准化厂商特定配置，设计混合命令-声明语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind实现了准确且可扩展的网络行为理解，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind框架有效解决了LLM在网络配置理解中的挑战，为自然语言驱动的网络行为理解提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

Motivation: 现有自动文献综述系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化、上下文过载等问题，限制了综述质量

Method: 基于循环大纲生成的框架，规划代理逐步检索、阅读和更新大纲；设计论文卡片提炼每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现；引入审阅-精炼循环和可视化增强

Result: 在既有和新兴主题上的实验表明，该方法在内容覆盖、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于现有基线，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述

Conclusion: IterSurvey通过模拟人类研究者的迭代阅读过程，有效提升了自动文献综述的质量，并引入Survey-Arena基准进行更可靠的评估

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同语言在并行文本编码时的token数量差异（token premiums），通过训练约7000个单语分词器，发现词汇表大小和预分词策略是影响token premiums的关键因素，并找到了各语言的最优词汇表大小来减少这种差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同语言在编码并行文本时所需的token数量存在差异（token premiums），这会导致训练吞吐量下降和推理成本增加。研究旨在理解造成这些跨语言差异的根本原因。

Method: 训练了约7000个可比较的单语分词器，涵盖97种语言，通过控制分词算法、词汇表大小和数据集大小等变量，测量token premiums并分析数据相似性、词汇表大小、预分词等因素的影响。

Result: 发现训练与测试数据的相似性不影响token premiums，但词汇表大小和预分词策略是关键因素。确定了各语言的最优词汇表大小能显著减少token premiums效应。超词分词器（允许跨空格合并）能同时减少token premiums并提高压缩效率。

Conclusion: 通过调整词汇表大小或预分词器，可以显著减少跨语言token premiums效应，从而提高多语言模型的训练效率和推理性能。

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

TL;DR: MATT是一种模型感知的分词器迁移方法，通过注意力影响建模将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到目标模型，实现高效的多语言LLM分词器迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词器迁移方法依赖语义启发式初始化新嵌入，忽略了高层模型动态，限制了迁移质量。

Method: 提出模型感知分词器迁移(MATT)，引入注意力影响建模(AIM)目标，将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型。

Result: 在多样化语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内恢复了原始模型的大部分性能，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 整合模型级信号为多语言LLM中的稳健分词器迁移提供了实用有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: LLMs can distinguish authors' writing styles by training separate models on each author's works, and using prediction accuracy to identify authorship.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To develop a method for identifying unique writing styles of different authors using language models, and apply it to resolve authorship attribution questions.

Method: Train individual GPT-2 models from scratch on each author's works, then compare prediction accuracy on held-out text from the same author versus other authors.

Result: Models trained on one author's works predict that author's text more accurately than other authors' text. Successfully confirmed R.P. Thompson's authorship of the 15th Oz book originally attributed to F.L. Baum.

Conclusion: LLMs can effectively capture and distinguish individual writing styles, providing a reliable method for authorship attribution.

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Method: 借鉴社会科学中成熟的说服策略，构建具有说服结构的对抗性提示，并研究LLMs在越狱响应中是否展现出独特的说服特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了跨学科洞察在应对LLM安全不断演变挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

Motivation: 尽管越狱攻击后缀的可转移性已被经验证实，但缺乏对其发生时机和原因的严格分析，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过大量实验设置，识别与转移成功强相关的三个统计属性：无后缀提示激活拒绝方向的程度、后缀诱导远离拒绝方向的强度，以及正交方向的偏移大小。

Result: 发现三个统计属性与转移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关，这些发现可用于实际攻击成功的改进。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对可转移性的更细致理解，并通过干预实验展示了统计分析如何转化为实际攻击成功的提升。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译中至关重要，但长度偏见的影响尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在揭示QE指标中存在的系统性长度偏见及其潜在风险。

Method: 对10种不同语言对的顶级回归基QE指标和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标进行系统性研究，分析其长度偏见模式。

Result: 发现QE指标存在两种关键长度偏见：1) 随着翻译长度增加，即使是无错误的高质量文本，QE指标也会过度预测错误；2) 当同一源文本有多个候选翻译时，QE指标偏好较短翻译。

Conclusion: QE指标中的长度偏见可能不公平地惩罚较长但正确的翻译，在QE重排序和强化学习等应用中导致次优决策。提出的长度归一化和引入参考文本策略能有效减少这种偏见。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

Conclusion: 这些发现为跨语言扩展定律的民主化提供了科学基础，使从业者能够超越英语优先的AI，有效扩展多语言模型。

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

Result: 发现稳定的情感几何结构，在8个真实情感数据集和5种语言中具有普适性，情感干预能有效操控情感感知而不影响语义。

Conclusion: LLM中存在一致且可操控的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

Motivation: 大语言模型即使在职业中性语境下仍会产生性别刻板印象语言，反映了深层社会偏见。现有偏见缓解方法的比较效果和学习动态尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 比较分析六种偏见缓解控制技术：仅提示、生成过滤、DFA-based Ctrl-G解码、监督微调(SFT)、直接偏好优化(DPO)和迭代零空间投影(INLP)，在组合约束任务上进行评估。

Result: SFT达到99.87%合规性和高词汇多样性，DPO仅4.53%合规性。Ctrl-G保证完全合规但严重降低流畅性和多样性。基于偏好的方法无法满足组合约束。

Conclusion: 只有显式正监督能够缓解组合偏见，偏好学习无法泛化逻辑结构，强调了显式监督对于公平流畅控制生成的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

### [228] [Generalization or Memorization: Dynamic Decoding for Mode Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22099)
*Xuanming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Mode Steering（DMS）框架，通过信息瓶颈理论理解LLMs的泛化与记忆双重性，并在推理时动态引导模型偏向泛化模式，提高逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在泛化能力和逐字记忆训练数据的双重性问题，这种不可预测性影响了其在关键应用中的可靠性。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论建立理论模型，开发DMS算法：包含轻量级因果线性探针识别记忆依赖，以及动态激活引导机制将计算推向泛化电路。

Result: 在推理和忠实性任务上的实验表明，DMS显著提高了逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Conclusion: DMS为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，通过自适应自对比解码实现推理时模式控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过输入令牌的对数压缩来扩展transformer长程记忆的方法，而不是修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数长上下文处理方法通过集成循环或辅助内存模块来增加transformer内部架构的复杂性，本文寻求一种替代方法。

Method: 受人类记忆认知模型启发，对输入令牌应用尺度不变的对数压缩，然后由标准未修改的transformer处理压缩后的表示。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线，困惑度有所降低，且性能随着压缩时间上下文的延长而持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级别的对数压缩是扩展transformer长程记忆的简单有效方法。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

TL;DR: Ling 2.0是一个面向推理的语言基础模型系列，采用混合专家(MoE)架构，参数规模从160亿到1万亿，通过高稀疏性和协调创新实现了高达7倍的计算效率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在构建一个可扩展的推理导向语言基础，通过稀疏激活与推理目标的对齐，实现高效且可扩展的智能系统。

Method: 采用高稀疏MoE架构、MTP推理效率优化、推理导向数据与训练中CoT激活、强化学习微调(DFT、Evo-CoT)、全尺度FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: 在万亿参数规模下，Ling-1T建立了推理精度与计算效率的新帕累托前沿，相比密集模型实现了高达7倍的活跃计算效率。

Conclusion: Ling 2.0为推进未来推理和思维模型提供了一个连贯、开放且高效的基础框架，证明了稀疏激活在推理导向下的可扩展性和效率优势。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

TL;DR: OlaMind是一个基于检索增强生成(RAG)的智能客服框架，通过两阶段学习机制显著提升回答的自然度和人类相似性，同时有效减少幻觉和业务风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的智能客服系统容易产生幻觉和机械式回答，这会带来业务风险并影响用户体验，特别是在Web客服交互场景中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) Learn-to-Think阶段从人类专家学习推理过程和回答策略；2) Learn-to-Respond阶段结合冷启动监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)进行基础到困难的自我优化。

Result: 在工业级社交客服场景的大规模A/B测试中，OlaMind在社区支持/直播互动场景分别实现了智能解决率提升28.92%/18.42%，人工接管率降低6.08%/7.12%。

Conclusion: OlaMind框架在不同真实应用场景中展现出一致的有效性，显著提升了智能客服系统的性能和用户体验。

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个迈蒂利语可解释情感分析数据集，包含3,221个带有情感极性和自然语言解释的句子，解决了低资源语言标注困难的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迈蒂利语作为低资源印欧语系语言，拥有1300万使用者但缺乏情感分析资源，现有资源通常缺乏细粒度标注和可解释性机制。

Method: 构建了由语言专家精心策划和验证的数据集，包含情感极性标注和迈蒂利语自然语言解释，使用经典机器学习和先进transformer架构进行实验验证。

Result: 数据集在可解释情感分析任务中表现出有效性，实验证明了其作为基准资源的实用性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的发展贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DETECT，首个德语专用的文本简化评估指标，使用合成LLM响应训练，在简化质量、意义保持和流畅性三个维度上全面评估德语自动文本简化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语自动文本简化评估依赖通用指标如SARI、BLEU和BERTScore，这些指标无法充分捕捉简化质量。德语缺乏专门评估指标和人工标注语料库。

Method: 将LENS框架适配到德语，扩展了(i)通过LLM生成合成质量分数的流程，(ii)基于LLM的评分标准对齐细化步骤，并构建了最大的德语人工评估数据集进行验证。

Result: DETECT在人类判断相关性方面显著优于广泛使用的ATS指标，在意义保持和流畅性方面提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语文本简化评估的空白，同时揭示了LLM在自动评估中的潜力和局限性，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可转移的指导原则。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

### [234] [Estimating the Error of Large Language Models at Pairwise Text Comparison](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22219)
*Tianyi Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种测量LLM在成对文本比较中输出错误的方法，通过Copeland计数构建文本排名来估计错误率，并在六个主流LLM上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要量化LLM在成对文本比较任务中的错误率，但缺乏真实标签作为基准，因此开发不依赖真实标签的误差估计方法。

Method: 使用两种场景估计错误率：(i)均匀错误率，通过每个文本对进行两次比较；(ii)二元位置偏差，假设不同比较顺序有不同错误率。通过Copeland计数构建文本排名来揭示LLM成对比较的可扩展性问题。

Result: 在六个LLM（ChatGPT、Claude、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Qwen）和五种文本类型上获得一致的错误率估计。两个位置偏差项相似，接近均匀错误。Claude在错误率和提示变化鲁棒性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法在指示LLM成对比较错误方面优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性评分，Claude在此任务中表现最理想。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的局限性，指出即使所有基本假设都满足，数学上仍存在准确性限制。同时强调了词汇渐进修改过程的重要性，并证明考虑这一过程能显著提高语言分离时间估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法基于词汇替换过程估计语言分离时间，但其基本假设往往不现实，且即使假设满足，数学上仍存在固有的准确性限制。这些概率性限制在词汇统计学研究中常被忽视。

Method: 从纯概率角度详细分析Swadesh方法的数学限制，同时引入词汇渐进修改过程作为影响语言词汇演化的另一个随机过程，并量化其对语言分离时间估计精度的影响。

Result: 揭示了Swadesh方法固有的概率性准确性限制，证明了词汇渐进修改过程对词汇重塑的重要贡献，并显示考虑这一过程能显著提高语言分离时间估计的精度。

Conclusion: Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的应用存在根本性的数学限制，而词汇渐进修改过程是语言演化中不可忽视的重要因素，综合考虑这两个随机过程能获得更准确的语言分离时间估计。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进标准CoT提示方法，通过约束性规则减少语义模糊和常识推理错误，提升LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出"Sculpting"方法，一种基于规则的约束提示技术，并在GSM8K数学推理基准上比较了三种提示策略（Zero Shot、标准CoT、Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型上的表现。

Result: 发现"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上表现更好（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而有害（94.00% vs 96.36%）。约束从"护栏"变成"手铐"，导致高级模型过度字面化。

Conclusion: 最优提示策略需要与模型能力共同进化，更强大的模型可能需要更简单的提示方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法依赖所有历史数据计算引导向量，但并非所有内容都反映真实用户偏好，这会削弱个性化信号

Method: 基于因果推断理论估计标记级因果效应来识别偏好驱动标记，将这些离散信号转换为连贯描述，然后用于引导个性化LLM生成

Result: 在两个代表性引导骨干方法和真实数据集上的实验表明，SteerX持续提升引导向量质量

Conclusion: SteerX通过关注真正偏好驱动信息，为更有效的LLM个性化提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在教育场景中支持学生学习，但在大学计算机科学课程中准确回答问题仍有困难。需要探索如何利用课程材料（如讲义幻灯片和文字记录）来提升模型性能。

Method: 比较了两种策略：检索增强生成（RAG）和持续预训练（CPT）。针对讲义幻灯片，进一步探索了多模态RAG方法，将检索内容以图像形式呈现给生成器。

Result: 实验表明，考虑到大学课程材料的相对较小规模，RAG比CPT更有效且高效。此外，在多模态设置中将幻灯片作为图像整合，相比仅文本检索显著提高了性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更好地支持学习和教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，并希望能在其他教育场景中激发类似努力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base改进有限；简单提示优于复杂提示；监督微调达到最佳性能（F1≈87.1%），但成本较高；LLM在二分类简化任务上表现更好。

Conclusion: 监督微调是临床NER的最佳方法，但需权衡成本；简单提示优于复杂提示；大型语言模型在简化任务上表现更优。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

Motivation: 寻求比深度神经网络更高效、更环保的语言建模方法，减少训练和推理过程中的生态足迹

Method: 实现快速的k近邻分类近似，完全依赖CPU运行，实现低延迟的基于记忆的语言建模

Result: OLIFANT实现与GPT-2和GPT-Neo相当的下一词预测准确率，同时显著降低排放并提高速度

Conclusion: 基于记忆的语言建模是深度神经网络语言建模的可行替代方案，具有生态友好、透明和高效的特点

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多语言目标立场提取基准，涵盖6种语言，将TSE任务扩展到多语言环境，无需为每种语言单独建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体数据驱动分析争议话题的公众意见很重要，但现有TSE研究仅限于英语，缺乏多语言基准。

Method: 扩展原始TSE流程到多语言设置，使用统一模型处理多种语言，不依赖语言特定模型。

Result: 模型管道获得12.78的F1分数，表明多语言任务比英语更困难，目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE提供了急需的基准，包括资源、算法和评估标准，并首次展示了TSE F1分数对不同目标表述的敏感性。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代优化循环，解决了复杂多跳查询中证据不完整的问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源综合信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统识别和填补证据空白的机制，容易传播噪声或无法收集全面上下文。

Method: 提出FAIR-RAG框架，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块，它将初始查询分解为所需发现清单，审计聚合证据以识别确认事实和明确信息空白，然后通过自适应查询优化代理生成针对性子查询来检索缺失信息，循环迭代直到证据充分。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等挑战性多跳QA基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线方法。在HotpotQA上达到0.453的F1分数，比最强迭代基线绝对提升8.3个百分点，在这些基准上建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究表明，具有明确空白分析的结构化、证据驱动的优化过程对于在高级RAG系统中实现复杂知识密集型任务的可靠准确推理至关重要。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine

demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

TL;DR: 提出了VisJudge-Bench，首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在可视化质量评估方面能力的基准，包含3,090个专家标注样本。研究发现现有MLLMs与人类专家存在显著差距，并提出了专门的可视化美学评估模型VisJudge，显著缩小了与人类判断的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时考虑数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像美学评估方面表现出色，但缺乏系统性的基准来衡量它们在可视化评估方面的能力。

Method: 构建了VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3,090个专家标注的真实场景样本，涵盖32种图表类型。提出了专门的可视化美学评估模型VisJudge。

Result: 最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家在判断上存在显著差距（MAE=0.551，与人类评分相关性仅0.429）。VisJudge将MAE降低至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（提高58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench填补了可视化质量评估基准的空白，VisJudge模型显著提升了可视化美学评估的性能，为可视化质量评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Conclusion: CAP数据集公开发布，旨在促进幻觉检测、多语言LLM评估以及更可靠的科学NLP系统的先进研究。

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: CHOIR是一个测试时框架，通过协调多个角色条件下的推理信号来提高LLM推理鲁棒性，无需额外训练即可显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 角色分配的LLMs在轻微人口统计扰动下会产生不同的推理轨迹和答案，作者认为这些变化不是需要消除的偏见，而是可以作为提高推理鲁棒性的建设性资源

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在反事实角色之间进行协作解码过程，动态平衡其推理路径中的一致性和分歧性

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，CHOIR持续提升性能，对个体人口群体的改进高达26.4%，五个人口群体的平均改进为19.2%，即使在基础角色不理想时仍有效

Conclusion: 通过将角色变化重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR为更可靠的LLM推理提供了可扩展和可泛化的方法

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统上通过比较重建和声学语音学研究声调产生，本文旨在引入计算方法来量化音高在不同声调产生阶段的功能角色。

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音平坦化的敏感性。

Result: 发现声调产生的连续统证据：无调安多方言最能容忍音高移除，完全声调卫藏方言显示严重性能下降，中间康方言处于两者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法能够捕捉声音变化的细粒度阶段，传统基于最小对立对的功能负荷指标可能高估过渡系统中音高的依赖性。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Method: 分析传统剪枝方法在通用领域校准下的损失扰动最小化，将任务特定特征分布纳入现有剪枝算法的重要性计算中，使用通用和任务特定校准数据分别计算重要性分数，基于激活范数差异将参数划分为共享和专属组，然后融合分数来指导剪枝过程。

Conclusion: 该方法能够与各种基础剪枝技术无缝集成，在压缩过程中保留LLM的专门化能力，是一种有效且一致的剪枝方法。

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

Motivation: 研究多语言ASR模型在不同语言中学习的子词标记库如何被利用，以及预训练数据差异是否影响推理时的标记使用模式。

Method: 通过记录Whisper模型在49种语言推理时的解码候选子词，跟踪其随时间累积的发现模式，分析子词空间的利用规律。

Result: 发现子词发现总数与语言预训练小时数无关，子词发现率遵循指数饱和模式，存在声学饱和时间阈值。拉丁文字语言的指标优于西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语言本身的结构特征约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供了实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估商业自动语音识别系统中存在的种族偏见，特别是分析不同种族背景说话者的转录准确性差异，以及社会语音变异如何影响系统性能。

Method: 使用太平洋西北英语语料库，分析四个种族背景说话者的转录准确性，引入启发式确定的语音错误率指标，将识别错误与特定的社会语音变量相关联。

Result: 对11个社会语音特征的分析显示，元音质量变化（特别是对低后元音合并和鼻前合并模式的抵抗）与不同种族群体的错误率差异系统相关，非裔美国人在所有评估系统中受影响最显著。

Conclusion: 方言语音变化的声学建模（而非词汇或句法因素）是商业ASR系统偏见的主要来源，PNWE语料库可作为语音技术偏见评估的宝贵资源，为通过训练数据中针对性表示社会语音多样性来改进ASR性能提供指导。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

### [254] [LooGLE v2: Are LLMs Ready for Real World Long Dependency Challenges?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22548)
*Ziyuan He,Yuxuan Wang,Jiaqi Li,Kexin Liang,Muhan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在现实世界长文本应用中的理解能力的基准测试，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码等领域，测试结果显示即使最佳模型也只达到59.2%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩展，但它们在长依赖任务中的实际理解能力仍然有限且研究不足，特别是在许多现实世界长文本应用中缺乏有效评估。

Method: 构建LooGLE v2基准测试，包含自动收集的16k到2M tokens的真实世界长文本，设计了10种领域特定的长依赖任务类型，通过可扩展的数据处理流程生成了1,934个QA实例。

Result: 对6个本地部署和4个API大语言模型的评估显示，即使最佳模型在基准测试中仅获得59.2%的总体得分，表明模型实际能理解的上下文长度远低于其声称的能力。

Conclusion: 流行的大语言模型在处理具有长依赖关系的现实世界任务时存在显著局限性，揭示了在实际长上下文理解能力方面仍有巨大的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

### [255] [SABlock: Semantic-Aware KV Cache Eviction with Adaptive Compression Block Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22556)
*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存驱逐框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的KV缓存内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的内存占用增长成为长上下文LLM推理的可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: 首先进行语义分割以对齐压缩边界与语言结构，然后应用段引导的令牌评分来优化令牌重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在相同内存预算下，SABlock持续优于最先进的基线方法。在NIAH测试中，仅用96个KV条目就达到99.9%的检索准确率，接近保留8K条目的全缓存基线性能。在1024固定缓存预算下，峰值内存使用减少46.28%，在128K上下文长度下解码速度提升高达9.5倍。

Conclusion: SABlock通过语义感知的自适应块大小策略，有效解决了KV缓存内存占用问题，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提高了压缩效率和解码速度。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

### [256] [A Closed-Loop Personalized Learning Agent Integrating Neural Cognitive Diagnosis, Bounded-Ability Adaptive Testing, and LLM-Driven Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22559)
*Zhifeng Wang,Xinyue Zheng,Chunyan Zeng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了EduLoop-Agent，一个端到端的个性化学习代理，通过整合神经认知诊断模型、有界能力估计计算机自适应测试策略和大语言模型，形成了"诊断-推荐-反馈"的闭环框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育方法通常孤立处理建模、题目选择和反馈，导致学生模型粗糙、适应性假设受限以及反馈缺乏针对性。需要构建一个闭环的个性化学习系统来解决这些问题。

Method: 使用神经认知诊断模型(NCD)提供细粒度的知识点掌握度评估，有界能力估计计算机自适应测试策略(BECAT)动态选择题目，大语言模型(LLMs)生成结构化、可操作的反馈。

Result: 在ASSISTments数据集上的实验显示，NCD模块在响应预测方面表现优异且提供可解释的掌握度评估，自适应推荐策略提高了题目相关性和个性化程度，基于LLM的反馈能提供针对性的学习指导。

Conclusion: 该设计有效且可实际部署，为智能教育中生成个性化学习路径提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了AI教育领域缺乏标准化评估框架的问题，提出了基于学习科学原则的评估方法研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏可靠、普遍接受且以教学为导向的评估框架和基准，LLM驱动的智能辅导系统进展难以追踪，现有评估存在主观性和不一致性问题。

Method: 通过真实案例研究分析现有评估实践及其挑战，基于跨学科AIED研究见解提出研究方向。

Result: 识别了当前ITS评估中的不一致性和有限泛化性问题，强调了标准化评估框架的必要性。

Conclusion: 提出了三个基于学习科学原则、实用可行且理论扎实的研究方向，旨在建立公平、统一且可扩展的ITS评估方法。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoBench是一个全自动、自持续的LLM评估框架，通过相互同行评审进行模型评估，解决了传统静态基准测试的测试集污染和适应性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态基准测试存在测试集污染和适应性有限的问题，需要一种动态、可扩展且抗污染的评估方法。

Method: 使用动态生成新颖评估任务的方法，模型交替充当问题生成器、参赛者和评委，通过迭代加权机制聚合同行判断形成共识排名。

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准有强相关性（分别为78%和63%），多评委设计显著优于单评委基线。

Conclusion: AutoBench为持续评估演进的语言模型提供了一个可扩展、抗污染的静态基准测试替代方案。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Conclusion: PCU代表了一种新兴的健康护理范式，不仅改善个人健康结果，还为公共卫生和科学发现提供了新基础，但面临架构设计和实施挑战。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

TL;DR: PerCoR是首个大规模波斯语常识推理基准，包含10.6万个多项选择题，采用新颖的连接词分割策略和DRESS-AF干扰项生成方法，在波斯语常识推理任务上展现了显著的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创建首个大规模波斯语常识推理基准，填补波斯语在常识推理任务上的空白，并开发有效的干扰项生成方法来提升数据集难度。

Method: 使用连接词分割策略生成连贯的句子补全对，提出DRESS-AF方法（基于嵌入相似性评分和对抗性过滤的干扰项排序）从正确答案池中选择干扰项以最大化模型混淆。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为89%，OpenAI-o3达到最高92.18%，Claude-Sonnet-3.7为91.17%，最强的开源模型DeepSeek-R1为82.51%，显示了数据集难度和性能差距。DRESS-AF方法在英语HellaSwag基准上也有效提升了难度。

Conclusion: PerCoR是一个具有挑战性的波斯语常识推理基准，展示了当前模型在波斯语常识推理上的局限性，DRESS-AF方法可有效提升数据集难度且具有跨语言适用性。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Preserving linguistic diversity is necessary as every language offers a
distinct perspective on the world. There have been numerous global initiatives
to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of
a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language
learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto
language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto
speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring
accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured
language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation
collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂关系模式并缓解数据稀疏性，这限制了少样本知识图谱补全的性能

Method: 使用邻域聚合编码器整合高阶邻居信息，共轭关系学习器结合隐式条件扩散关系模块和稳定关系模块，以及流形共轭解码器在流形空间中评估和推理缺失三元组

Result: 在三个基准测试中，该方法优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架通过共轭关系建模有效提升了少样本知识图谱补全的性能

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统if-then规则被广泛用于解释机器学习模型，但尚未应用于解释RAG增强的LLM系统。RAG允许在推理时整合检索信息，因此可以通过规则解释输出来源

Method: 提出优化规则生成方法，受Apriori剪枝启发但重新定义，避免暴力枚举所有源组合，通过检查源存在或缺失是否导致相同输出来生成规则

Result: 通过定性和定量实验验证了解决方案的价值和效率

Conclusion: 成功将if-then规则应用于解释RAG-LLM系统，提出高效规则生成方法，为理解LLM决策提供新途径

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大型语言模型具有强大的泛化能力，但在文本分类基准测试中表现不佳，需要改进分类性能。

Method: 将每个类别标签映射到不同的输出标记，构建提示以引出单标记响应，在推理时仅投影到相关类别标记的logits上。

Result: SALSA在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，证明了其在基于LLM的分类应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SALSA通过避免冷启动训练，提供了一种高效且准确的LLM文本分类解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

TL;DR: E²Rank是一个统一的嵌入排序框架，通过列表排序目标继续训练单个文本嵌入模型，使其能够同时执行高质量检索和列表重排序，在保持效率的同时显著提升重排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型在检索应用中虽然高效，但排序保真度有限，特别是与专门的LLM列表重排序器相比存在差距。需要一种既能保持嵌入模型效率又能提升排序性能的统一方法。

Method: 提出E²Rank框架，使用查询和文档嵌入的余弦相似度作为统一排序函数，构建包含原始查询和候选文档的列表排序提示，类似于传统检索中的伪相关反馈，通过列表排序目标继续训练嵌入模型。

Result: 在BEIR重排序基准上达到最先进结果，在BRIGHT推理密集型基准上表现有竞争力，重排序延迟极低，且在MTEB基准上的嵌入性能也有所提升。

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型可以有效统一检索和重排序任务，在计算效率和排序准确性方面都表现出色，为实际搜索应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

TL;DR: 使用参数高效微调方法（LoRA）对大型语言模型进行持续预训练，以极低的数据和计算成本将模型适配到魁北克法语方言，在保持主流语言性能的同时显著提升方言处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的能力主要集中在高资源语言上，而低资源方言缺乏足够的训练数据。研究如何在有限的数据和计算预算下，通过持续预训练将LLMs适配到区域方言。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）和计算高效的持续预训练方法，使用极小的数据集对三个LLMs进行魁北克法语方言适配，并在COLE套件上进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示在方言基准测试上有所改进，同时对主流语言基准的回归最小，仅更新了不到1%的模型参数。结果增益高度依赖于语料库的组成。

Conclusion: 参数高效微调的持续预训练能够以成本效益高的方式缩小方言差距，为少数语言社区提供高质量LLM访问，并促进可持续的语言资源创建。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型在上下文学习中的时间偏差，发现模型倾向于检索序列开头和结尾的信息，中间信息检索可靠性较低，这与人类情景记忆的时间分离机制类似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何基于时间关系检索上下文信息，类比人类情景记忆的时间分离机制，研究不同预训练模型在区分和检索时间分离事件方面的能力。

Method: 通过在序列中固定重复token的位置并置换其他token，消除语义干扰，隔离时间效应对下一个token预测的影响。对transformer和状态空间模型进行对比分析，并进行消融实验验证归纳头的作用。

Result: 模型对重复token后的token赋予最高概率，但存在对序列开头和结尾token的明显偏好。transformer模型的这种现象与归纳头相关。状态空间模型和transformer模型表现出相似的时间偏差。

Conclusion: 研究加深了对上下文学习中时间偏差的理解，展示了这些偏差如何实现时间分离和情景检索，为理解语言模型的信息检索机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

TL;DR: EchoMind是首个多层级、相互关联的基准测试，通过顺序任务模拟共情对话的认知过程，评估语音语言模型在理解口语内容、感知声音线索、综合推理和生成回应方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能整合对实现类人、情感智能对话的重要性。需要验证语音语言模型是否能充分感知非词汇声音线索并产生符合情感和情境因素的共情回应。

Method: 设计EchoMind基准测试，包含口语内容理解、声音线索感知、综合推理和回应生成四个顺序任务。使用语义中性的相同脚本，通过控制声音风格变化来独立测试表达效果。基于包含3个粗粒度和12个细粒度维度的共情导向框架，涵盖39个声音属性。

Result: 测试12个先进语音语言模型发现，即使是当前最先进的模型在处理高表达性声音线索方面也存在困难，限制了共情回应的质量。在指令遵循、对自然语音变化的适应能力以及有效利用声音线索实现共情方面存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: 语音语言模型需要整合语言内容与多样化声音线索，才能实现真正的共情对话能力。EchoMind基准测试揭示了当前模型在情感智能对话方面的局限性，为未来发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

TL;DR: MMPersuade框架系统研究大型视觉语言模型在多模态说服中的动态，发现多模态输入显著增强说服效果，先验偏好可降低模型易感性，不同说服策略在不同场景下效果各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LVLMs在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们面临大量说服性内容。了解模型作为被说服者的易感性和不同说服策略的有效性至关重要，因为过度易感的模型可能采纳误导性信念或生成不道德输出。

Method: 提出MMPersuade框架，包括：(i)包含图像和视频的多模态数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为及对抗场景的说服原则；(ii)通过第三方一致性评分和对话历史自估计概率来量化说服效果和模型易感性的评估框架。

Result: 对六个领先LVLMs的研究显示：(i)多模态输入相比纯文本显著增强说服效果和模型易感性，特别是在错误信息场景；(ii)先验偏好可降低易感性，但多模态信息仍保持说服优势；(iii)不同策略在不同场景效果各异，互惠在商业和主观场景最有效，可信度和逻辑在对抗场景占优。

Conclusion: MMPersuade通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，为开发在面对说服性多模态内容时保持稳健、偏好一致和伦理对齐的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

TL;DR: R4P是一个用于软件工程代理训练的补丁验证模型，通过推理而非传统测试来提供可扩展的奖励，解决了现有测试监督方法的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在可扩展性限制：测试沙箱构建运行成本高且脆弱，高覆盖率测试数据稀缺且易受边缘案例测试攻击。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，采用分组目标进行强化学习训练，通过比较多个补丁的修改来获得密集奖励。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上达到72.2%的补丁验证准确率，超越OpenAI o3。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2% Pass@1，比原Qwen3-32B提升10.0%。R4P验证补丁速度比测试快50倍。

Conclusion: R4P通过推理驱动的补丁验证提供了可扩展的奖励机制，显著提升了软件工程代理的训练效率和性能，展现了实际应用价值。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了商业和开源大语言模型在七种语言上的人权侵犯检测性能，发现模型对齐而非规模决定了跨语言稳定性，为资源有限的人道组织提供了成本-可靠性权衡的实用指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人道组织面临关键选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费开源模型进行多语言人权监控。商业系统提供可靠性，但开源替代方案缺乏实证验证——特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言上。

Method: 在78,000次多语言推理中评估了六个模型（四个对齐模型和两个开源模型），使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性度量：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性得分和语言稳定性得分。

Result: 结果显示对齐而非规模决定稳定性：对齐模型在类型学上遥远和低资源语言（如林加拉语、缅甸语）上保持近乎不变的准确性和平衡校准，而开源模型表现出显著的提示语言敏感性和校准漂移。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关的推理，为人道组织在多语言部署中平衡预算约束与可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CoT和PoT在复杂多步推理中仍会产生不理想的解决方案，特别是在算法领域。需要一种更可靠的方法来改进推理质量。

Method: 提出PIPS方法：在实例级别生成和优化程序，使用结构反馈而不依赖任务特定指导或显式测试用例，并引入置信度指标动态选择直接推理或程序合成。

Result: 在3个前沿LLM和30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别提升绝对调和平均准确率8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中减少65.1%的不良程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和动态选择机制，显著提升了复杂推理任务的性能，减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差解缠方法，从语言模型中分离出词汇、语法、意义和推理四个正交嵌入，用于分析大脑对语言处理的神经机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型的内部表征高度"纠缠"，混合了词汇、语法、意义和推理信息，这使大脑编码分析偏向浅层语言特征，难以分离深层认知过程的神经基础。

Method: 通过残差解缠方法，先探测语言模型识别特征特定层，然后迭代回归掉低层表征，产生四个近乎正交的嵌入表示。

Result: 分离出的推理嵌入具有独特预测能力，能解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差，且推理神经信号在时间上更晚出现（约350-400ms）。

Conclusion: 标准未解缠的语言模型嵌入可能产生误导，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征，掩盖了深层认知处理的贡献。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs存在不确定性现象，即模型在重新提示时会改变之前正确的答案。通过识别并屏蔽一小部分非检索注意力头，可以显著减少这种翻转行为，但下游任务中存在权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在不确定性行为，这会破坏信任并在高风险领域带来严重风险，因此需要研究其机制并找到缓解方法。

Method: 采用Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，结合Flip式重新评估提示来模拟答案翻转场景，识别影响不确定性的注意力头并进行屏蔽实验。

Result: 发现检索头不是避免不确定性的主要原因，而是少数非检索注意力头过度关注误导性token。屏蔽这些头可将翻转行为减少15%，且不会引入不连贯或过度修正问题。

Conclusion: 研究为机制可解释性领域做出贡献，并提出了一种简单有效的技术来缓解LLMs中的不确定性驱动故障模式，但在下游任务中存在权衡。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a

authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an

### [281] [Batch Speculative Decoding Done Right](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22876)
*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了EQSPEC和EXSPEC两种批量推测解码方法，解决了批量处理中的不规则张量问题，在保证输出等价性的同时显著提升了推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通过小模型预测多个token来加速LLM推理，但在批量处理时会出现不规则张量问题，导致位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态损坏，现有批量实现违反了输出等价性要求。

Method: 首先分析确保正确性的同步需求，提出EQSPEC方法识别对齐开销占40%，然后引入EXSPEC方法维护滑动序列池并动态形成相同长度分组，减少对齐开销同时保持每个序列的推测加速效果。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B目标/草稿模型对，在批量大小8时相比批量大小1实现了最高3倍的吞吐量提升，同时保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需定制内核，能干净集成到现有推理栈中，有效解决了批量推测解码中的不规则张量问题，在保持输出等价性的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

### [282] [Language Server CLI Empowers Language Agents with Process Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22907)
*Yifan Zhang,Lanser Contributors*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Lanser-CLI是一个CLI优先的编排层，通过固定和中介语言服务器协议(LSP)服务器，为编码代理和CI提供确定性、可重放的工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生幻觉API和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能计算关于真实代码的已验证、IDE级事实。

Method: 使用Selector DSL提供稳健的寻址方案，创建确定性分析包，为变异操作提供安全信封，以及基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并为过程奖励建立了单调性属性，使其适用于过程监督和反事实分析。

Conclusion: 语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励，使代理的规划循环与程序现实对齐。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

*Liwei Jiang,Yuanjun Chai,Margaret Li,Mickel Liu,Raymond Fok,Nouha Dziri,Yulia Tsvetkov,Maarten Sap,Alon Albalak,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题上的输出多样性，揭示了语言模型存在的人工蜂群效应（模式崩溃问题），即模型内部和不同模型之间都会产生高度相似的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类似人类的创意内容方面存在困难，这可能导致人类思维长期同质化的风险。目前缺乏评估语言模型输出多样性的可扩展方法，特别是在开放性问题领域。

Method: 引入Infinity-Chat数据集，包含26K个多样化的真实世界开放性问题查询，建立了首个全面的开放性问题提示分类法（6个顶级类别，17个子类别），并收集了31,250个人类标注（每个示例25个独立标注）。

Result: 研究发现语言模型在开放性问题生成中存在显著的人工蜂群效应，表现为（1）模型内部重复性，以及（2）模型间同质性。同时发现语言模型、奖励模型和语言模型评判者在处理引发不同个体偏好的模型生成时，对人类评分的校准能力较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放性问题提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了缓解人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TAG（标签增强生成）方法，通过在长上下文QA任务中为文档添加标签或标签定义，显著提升LLM性能，无需改变文档完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型语言模型在处理长复杂上下文时存在有效问答和推理能力不足的问题，现有方法如RAG对分块、嵌入和检索策略敏感且需要大量预处理。

Method: 使用轻量级数据增强策略TAG，为检索到的文档添加标签或仅将标签定义加入QA提示中，不改变文档原始结构和内容。

Result: 在NoLima和NovelQA基准测试中，TAG方法带来一致性能提升：32K token上下文提升17%，复杂推理多跳查询提升2.9%。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的长上下文增强方法，能显著提升LLM在复杂问答任务中的表现，且不损害文档完整性。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种评估长文本事实准确性的系统方法，包括构建中文长文本事实性数据集LongHalluQA、开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact，以及引入事实重要性层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生物医学、法律和教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对输出事实准确性的担忧，现有短文本评估方法无法有效处理长文本的复杂推理链和累积信息。

Method: 整合大规模长文本数据集、多智能体验证机制和加权评估指标，构建中文长文本事实性数据集LongHalluQA，开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact，并引入事实重要性层次结构。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国内模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 这项工作为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了一个结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

*Michael Hardy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文开发了基于句子嵌入的定制LLM来客观测量教学质量，这些模型在课堂观察评估中达到了人类水平甚至超人类表现，并与教师增值指标相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决教育中教学质量客观可扩展测量的挑战，传统通用LLM在处理复杂课堂观察工具时不可靠，需要专门架构来处理长文本的课堂记录。

Method: 使用基于句子级嵌入的定制LLM架构，系统评估五种不同句子嵌入，采用数据高效训练机制防止过拟合，分析注释上下文窗口。

Result: 专业模型达到人类水平表现（与专家评分相关性>0.65），超越平均人-人评分相关性；高级模型将更多分数变异归因于课程级特征而非孤立话语；聚合模型分数与教师增值指标相关。

Conclusion: 建立了一种可行且强大的AI驱动教学测量新方法，为教师发展提供可扩展、可靠且有效的反馈路径，但模型在单项水平上尚未完全泛化。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

TL;DR: 对最先进的transformer、状态空间和混合大语言模型在基于知识的上下文学习任务上进行深入评估，发现不同架构的LLM在任务表现上可能相似，但内部机制存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深入理解不同架构大语言模型在上下文学习中的内部机制差异，特别是transformer、状态空间和混合模型在知识型任务中的表现。

Method: 结合行为探测和干预方法，分析不同架构LLM在上下文学习中的内部机制，重点关注自注意力层和Mamba层中的功能向量。

Result: 发现负责上下文学习的功能向量主要位于自注意力层和Mamba层，Mamba2可能使用不同于功能向量的机制进行上下文学习。功能向量在涉及参数知识检索的上下文学习中更重要，但在上下文知识理解中作用较小。

Conclusion: 不同架构的LLM在任务表现相似时内部机制可能不同，强调了结合行为和机制分析来研究LLM能力的重要性。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

TL;DR: TIR-Judge是一个端到端的强化学习框架，用于训练集成代码执行器的LLM评估器，在多个基准测试中超越了基于纯文本推理的评估器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数LLM评估器仅基于内在文本推理，限制了验证复杂约束或执行准确计算的能力，而工具集成推理在其他任务中已证明成功。

Method: 基于三个原则构建：跨可验证和不可验证领域的多样化训练、灵活的评估格式（点对点、成对、列表）、无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge在点对点评估上超越强推理评估器6.4%，在成对评估上超越7.7%，列表评估性能与Claude-Opus-4相当但参数仅8B。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评估器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，TIR-Judge-Zero完全无需蒸馏评估轨迹即可达到蒸馏变体的性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 提出Knocking-Heads Attention (KHA)机制，通过共享对角初始化投影矩阵实现注意力头间的特征级交互，解决多头注意力中头间缺乏强交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多头注意力机制（包括标准MHA、GQA、GTA等）只是简单拼接各头的输出，缺乏头间的强交互，且增加头数会削弱单个头的能力。

Method: 在缩放点积注意力前应用共享对角初始化投影矩阵，使注意力头能够相互"敲击"，实现跨头特征级交互，同时保持头特定专业化。

Result: 在6.1B参数MoE模型上验证，KHA带来更优越和稳定的训练动态，在下游任务上表现更好，且仅增加少量参数和FLOPs。

Conclusion: KHA是一种有效增强多头注意力头间交互的方法，可无缝集成到各种注意力变体中，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

TL;DR: 提出QTT-RAG方法，通过显式评估翻译质量（语义等价性、语法准确性、自然流畅性）并附加质量分数作为元数据，解决多语言检索增强生成中翻译质量差导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么假设翻译质量足够好，要么使用重写方法导致事实扭曲和幻觉。在低资源语言环境下，翻译质量差会严重影响响应生成性能。

Method: 提出质量感知翻译标记方法，从三个维度评估翻译质量：语义等价性、语法准确性、自然流畅性，并将这些分数作为元数据附加到翻译内容上，不改变原始内容。

Result: 在两个开放域QA基准（XORQA、MKQA）上使用6个指令调优LLM（2.4B-14B参数）评估，涵盖韩语、芬兰语（低资源）和中文（高资源）。QTT-RAG在保持事实完整性的同时优于基线方法。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG通过在翻译可靠性基础上让生成模型做出明智决策，有效利用跨语言文档，为低资源环境下的多语言领域提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence
of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational
competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for
large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了时间序列数据独特的统计特性和时间依赖性，需要将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计来弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出四个专门提示组件：全局域提示（数据集级上下文）、局部域提示（近期趋势和序列特定行为）、统计提示和时序提示（基于自相关、偏自相关和傅里叶分析的手工洞察），通过跨模态对齐模块生成统一表示。

Result: 在8个不同数据集上的实验表明，MAP4TS持续优于最先进的基于LLM的方法，提示感知设计显著提升了性能稳定性，GPT-2骨干网络在结构化提示下在长期预测任务中优于LLaMA等更大模型。

Conclusion: MAP4TS框架通过将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计，有效提升了LLM在时间序列预测中的性能，特别是在长期预测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

Method: 研究了两种层次组织方法，在三个大型语言模型上进行测试。使用自动指标、基于模型的指标以及领域专家评估（偏好、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖度、事实性和连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工编写的摘要。层次方法通常能保持信息的事实性、覆盖度和连贯性，同时提高人类偏好。GPT-4的模拟判断与人类判断在更客观的评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以改善模型生成的医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖度，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧凑的单模型多语言词形变化方法，在73种语言上联合训练，性能优于单语言基线，简化了部署过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理未见词汇的系统，包括捷克语等广泛语言

Method: 使用单模型在73种语言数据上联合训练，引入基于频率加权、词干不相交的训练-开发-测试重采样过程

Result: 模型轻量级、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线模型

Conclusion: 证明了多语言建模在词形变化任务中的有效性，具有简化部署的实用价值

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

### [296] [Beyond Higher Rank: Token-wise Input-Output Projections for Efficient Low-Rank Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23123)
*Shiwei Li,Xiandi Luo,Haozhao Wang,Xing Tang,Ziqiang Cui,Dugang Liu,Yuhua Li,Xiuqiang He,Ruixuan Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA)，通过动态调整LoRA权重来捕获token特定信息，相比标准LoRA实现了更细粒度的适配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入token共享相同权重，限制了捕获token特定信息的能力，因为不同token之间存在语义差异。

Method: TopLoRA通过$B\Sigma_X A$公式动态调整LoRA权重，其中$\Sigma_X$是从每个输入token生成的对角矩阵，实现token级别的输入-输出投影。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，TopLoRA始终优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA在不增加LoRA权重秩的情况下，通过token级别的权重调整实现了更精细的适配，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索将语料库频率信息融入形态学屈折任务中，通过频率加权的训练-开发-测试分割、引入词元准确率评估以及频率感知训练方法，在43种语言中的26种上优于均匀采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态学屈折方法缺乏频率分布信息，而实际部署中用户输入反映自然文本的真实频率分布，因此需要将语料频率信息整合到系统开发中。

Method: 采用三种方法：1) 结合词元不相交和频率加权的训练-测试分割；2) 补充类型准确率评估为词元准确率评估；3) 引入频率感知训练方法，在采样过程中显式纳入词频。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种上优于均匀采样，表明频率信息能提升形态学屈折性能。

Conclusion: 将语料频率信息融入形态学屈折任务能更好地反映真实世界分布，频率感知训练是有效的改进方法。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

TL;DR: ENTP框架通过神经符号方法净化低质量SFT数据，仅使用低质量数据构建的数据集在多个基准测试中超越了13种现有数据选择方法和完整原始数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法通常丢弃低质量数据，但其中可能包含有价值信息，且质量过滤器往往不完美。

Method: 提出ENTP框架，包含符号模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经模块（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成增强的指令-响应对）。

Result: ENTP增强的数据集在五个指令遵循基准测试中优于13种基线方法，甚至超过了在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调效果。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

TL;DR: 提出了双阶段精炼框架，将创意叙事生成与格式转换解耦，通过分解架构和混合数据合成方法，使LLM能够生成高质量剧本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统端到端生成方法无法同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循两种不同能力，导致生成的剧本缺乏深层结构完整性和故事实质

Method: 双阶段精炼框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转换为丰富的散文风格叙事，第二阶段将叙事精炼为专业格式的剧本；采用混合数据合成方法解决训练数据稀缺问题

Result: 专业编剧盲评显示，DSR相对于Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线达到75%的胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制化数据合成能有效使LLM在复杂创意领域实现专业化

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

TL;DR: MATCH是一种新的无参考代码评估指标，使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的嵌入表示，通过相似性评分来衡量生成代码与开发者意图的匹配程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代码生成日益普及，但准确评估生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度仍是一个挑战。传统评估方法（如单元测试）难以扩展且成本高，现有语法相似性指标无法捕捉代码功能，而CodeBERTScore等指标需要参考代码。

Method: 使用对比学习生成代码和自然语言任务描述的有意义嵌入表示，通过相似性评分来评估生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中与功能正确性和人类偏好的相关性优于现有指标。

Conclusion: MATCH提供了一种有效的无参考代码评估方法，能够更好地衡量生成代码与开发者意图的匹配度。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

*Shuai Huang,Wenxuan Zhao,Jun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社交智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境推理上超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展出拟人能力并被部署为自主代理与人类互动，评估其在真实复杂社交互动中的表现成为重要挑战。现有研究通过模拟代理间交互构建数据集，无法捕捉真实人类对话的语言风格和关系动态。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，从社交网络应用收集2,221个真实多轮对话构建SI-Bench基准，并对312个对话在8个主要模型上进行人工标注。

Result: 实验表明：SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理上超越了人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类；引入思维链推理可能降低LLMs在社交对话任务中的表现。

Conclusion: SI-Bench为评估LLMs的社交智能提供了重要基准，揭示了当前模型在社交推理和回复质量方面的差距，所有数据集已开源。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物关系抽取对识别药物相互作用和预测副作用至关重要，但目前缺乏专门的数据集，需要采用迁移学习。

Method: 首先使用训练好的关系抽取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用于医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证抽取结果。

Result: 定量结果显示LLM对PubMed摘要子集中抽取的71%关系表示同意，定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域的模糊性。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效构建药物关系本体，同时凸显了医学领域关系抽取面临的挑战。

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种句子级过程奖励模型（PRM）来检测大型视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告中的幻觉，该模型在弱监督下训练，能有效识别事实错误，并在不同模型间具有良好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自动生成放射学报告时经常产生临床关键性幻觉，存在严重风险，现有检测方法缺乏句子级粒度且泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发句子级过程奖励模型（PRM），基于临床上下文和先前文本预测每个生成句子的正确性，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调。

Result: 轻量级0.5B参数PRM在多个指标上优于现有验证技术，在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，能有效过滤低质量报告并提升临床指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了模型无关的安全层，无需访问内部激活状态即可有效减少幻觉风险。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Motivation: 传统语音识别研究主要关注标准语言形式，而方言ASR通常被视为微调任务，需要研究方言变异对ASR的实际影响。

Method: 开发了78小时的孟加拉语方言语音数据集Ben-10，从语言学和数据驱动角度分析语音基础模型在方言ASR中的表现，包括零样本和微调设置。

Result: 语音基础模型在方言ASR中表现严重不足，所有深度学习方法都难以建模方言变异数据，但方言特定模型训练能缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 方言变异对ASR构成显著挑战，需要专门的数据集和训练方法，Ben-10数据集可作为资源受限条件下ASR建模的OOD资源。

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed
for this project are publicly available

Motivation: 解决现有阿拉伯语模型依赖英文翻译数据导致意图检测和检索增强生成失败的问题，确保文化真实性和准确性，同时解决事实正确但无法满足用户核心需求的"效用差距危机"。

Method: 基于真实阿拉伯语源（包括历史手稿数字化、学术著作、学术论文等）训练，采用深度语言工程框架和实用闭合架构，结合深度文化遗产专业化和多学科专家模块。

Result: 模型能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，掌握阿拉伯语的优雅表达，准确检测用户意图并提供上下文相关响应，从信息存储库转变为决定性指导工具。

Conclusion: Mubeen通过原生阿拉伯语源和实用闭合架构，成功解决了阿拉伯语AI模型的文化准确性和用户需求满足问题，支持沙特2030愿景，在文化遗产保护和通用知识领域均表现强劲。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在传统编程任务上表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中往往产生美观度较差的代码，需要专门优化代码美学质量。

Method: 构建AesCode-358K数据集，提出多代理奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美学和交互美学，开发GRPO-AR算法联合优化功能性和代码美学。

Result: 实验表明，在AesCode-358K上进行监督微调并结合强化学习，在OpenDesign基准上显著提升性能，AesCoder-4B超越GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，达到480B-685B参数开源模型的性能水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美学质量，证明了专门优化代码美学的可行性和重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields

### [308] [DCMM-SQL: Automated Data-Centric Pipeline and Multi-Model Collaboration Training for Text-to-SQL Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23284)
*Yuanzhen Xie,Liu Ye,Jiqun Chu,Mochi Gao,Hehuan Liu,Yunzhi Tan,Bo Hu,Zang Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的数据为中心的方法来改进文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，以及多模型协作训练策略，在轻量级模型中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响很少被探索。现有方法主要依赖单一微调模型，其能力有限。

Method: 设计了全自动数据为中心管道：自适应数据修复（自动发现和修复训练数据错误）、错误数据增强（扩散和增强模型预测的错误数据）、多模型协作训练（用不同增强数据训练多个模型）、集成策略（整合多模型能力解决多选题）。

Result: 实验和消融研究证明了数据为中心管道和多模型交互迭代策略的有效性，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，突破了单一模型的能力限制。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

*Mouhand Alkadri,Dania Desouki,Khloud Al Jallad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了阿拉伯语儿童语音数据集Arabic Little STT，评估了Whisper模型在儿童语音识别上的表现，发现性能显著低于成人语音，强调需要专门的儿童语音基准和包容性训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言的儿童语音数据稀缺问题，填补儿童特定语音语料库的空白，促进公平的语音技术发展。

Method: 创建了包含355个话语的Levantine阿拉伯语儿童语音数据集，对8个Whisper变体进行系统评估，并与成人阿拉伯语基准进行比较。

Result: 即使是表现最好的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率也高达0.66，而成人数据集上的词错误率低于0.20，性能差距显著。

Conclusion: 需要专门的儿童语音基准和包容性训练数据，强调数据收集必须遵循严格的伦理和隐私框架，保护敏感的儿童信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

*Mohammad Atif Quamar,Mohammad Areeb,Nishant Sharma,Ananth Shreekumar,Jonathan Rosenthal,Muslum Ozgur Ozmen,Mikhail Kuznetsov,Z. Berkay Celik*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的分块搜索策略，通过自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于响应中更关键的前几个token，在LLM对齐任务中表现优于Best-of-N和微调基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍是一个关键挑战。推理时方法提供了微调的灵活替代方案，但其均匀的计算努力通常产生次优的对齐效果。假设在许多对齐任务中，响应的初始token不成比例地更为关键。

Method: 引入AdaSearch，一种新颖的分块搜索策略。它使用采样计划自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于这些关键token的搜索努力。将其应用于顺序解码，并引入其树搜索对应物AdaBeam。

Result: 在八个LLM上的综合评估显示，AdaSearch优于强大的Best-of-N和微调基线。具体而言，在无害生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务中，胜率相对于Best-of-N提高了超过10%。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过自适应计算分配策略，有效提升了LLM对齐任务的性能，特别是在关键初始token上集中搜索努力的方法被证明是有效的。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了首个基于八字命理的人格推理QA数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型结合，生成时间动态的细粒度虚拟人格，相比主流LLM准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟角色生成方法依赖标注数据或手工制作的人格提示，难以扩展和生成真实、上下文一致的人格。

Method: 创建八字命理人格推理QA数据集，将人类经验分类为财富、健康、亲情、职业和关系等生活事件问答；提出BaZi-LLM系统，将符号推理与大语言模型集成。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%；当使用错误八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%。

Conclusion: 基于文化的符号-LLM整合具有实现真实角色模拟的潜力。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

*Teng Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightKGG是一个使用小型语言模型高效从文本数据中提取知识图谱的新框架，通过上下文集成图提取和拓扑增强关系推理两个关键技术，在低资源环境下实现准确的知识图谱构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量知识图谱的稀缺是下游AI应用的关键瓶颈，现有提取方法依赖容易出错的模式匹配技术或资源密集型大语言模型，计算需求限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 提出LightKGG框架，包含两个关键技术：(1)上下文集成图提取：将上下文信息与节点和边集成到统一图结构中；(2)拓扑增强关系推理：利用提取图的固有拓扑高效推断关系。

Result: 该框架能够使用小型语言模型准确构建知识图谱，大幅降低硬件需求，在保持关键信息的同时减少对复杂语义处理的依赖。

Conclusion: 这项工作弥合了自动知识提取与实际部署场景之间的差距，同时为结构化NLP任务中优化小型语言模型效率引入了科学严谨的方法。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个评估大语言模型预测AI对就业影响能力的基准，结合了美国部门级职位发布数据和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，通过多种提示策略评估LLMs的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但缺乏系统预测AI对就业影响的工具。现有研究表明LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少评估其在前瞻性劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 结合两个互补数据集：美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据，构建具有明确时间分割的预测任务。使用任务支架、角色驱动和混合等多种提示策略评估不同模型家族的LLMs。

Result: 结构化任务提示持续提高预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上具有优势。但性能在不同部门和预测时间跨度上差异显著，突显了领域感知提示和严格评估协议的必要性。

Conclusion: 通过发布该基准，旨在支持未来关于劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究，为研究AI作为劳动力市场预测工具的局限性和机会提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究比较了基于规则的方法和大型语言模型在检测气候相关文本中宗教语言的性能，发现基于规则的方法标记更多句子为宗教语言，揭示了宗教语言检测的方法学挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宗教语言在当代话语中持续存在，甚至在环境行动主义和气候变化辩论等表面上世俗的领域中也是如此。本研究旨在调查宗教语言在世俗和宗教非政府组织(NGOs)制作的气候相关文本中的显性和隐性形式。

Method: 引入双重方法学方法：基于规则的方法使用从生态神学文献中提取的宗教术语层次树，以及大型语言模型(LLMs)在零样本设置下运行。使用包含超过88万句子的数据集进行比较分析。

Result: 结果显示基于规则的方法一致地比LLMs标记更多句子为宗教语言。这些发现不仅突出了计算检测宗教语言的方法学挑战，还揭示了关于宗教语言是否应仅由词汇定义还是由上下文意义定义的更广泛张力。

Conclusion: 本研究通过展示分析神圣在气候话语中持续存在的方法的潜力和局限性，为宗教研究中的数字方法做出了贡献。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于混合专家(MoE)框架的时间序列预测模型，整合了xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST和minGRU等SOTA模型，通过Transformer门控网络实现，在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有TSF模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对时间序列预测中Transformer模型有效性的争议，以及近期研究显示简单模型有时优于复杂模型的发现，作者希望开发一个能够整合多种互补模型的强大框架来应对TSF数据对近期历史偏好的特性和不可预测事件。

Method: 采用混合专家(MoE)框架，整合xLSTM、增强线性模型、PatchTST、minGRU等多种SOTA模型，使用基于Transformer的门控网络进行模型集成。

Result: 提出的模型在标准基准测试中超越了所有现有时间序列预测模型，包括最新的基于MoE框架的方法。

Conclusion: 通过整合多种互补的SOTA模型，基于MoE框架的方法能够有效提升时间序列预测性能，证明了模型多样性和集成策略的重要性。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

Motivation: 解决奖励模型面临的两个基本挑战：模态不平衡（主要关注文本和图像，对其他模态支持有限）和偏好刚性（固定二元偏好对无法捕捉个性化偏好的复杂性）。

Method: 构建了Omni-RewardBench基准测试（覆盖5种模态的9个任务）、Omni-RewardData数据集（248K通用偏好对和69K指令调优对），以及包含判别式和生成式奖励模型的Omni-RewardModel。

Result: Omni-RewardModel在Omni-RewardBench及其他广泛使用的奖励建模基准上取得了强劲性能。

Conclusion: Omni-Reward是迈向支持自由形式偏好的通用多模态奖励建模的重要一步，有效解决了现有奖励模型的局限性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景下的置信度，而在复杂多轮交互中的置信度研究有限。本文旨在探索LLM搜索代理在长序列动作后通过语言化置信度分数传达自身置信度的能力。

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，发现模型在高置信度时任务准确率更高。基于此提出测试时缩放(TTS)方法，使用置信度分数确定答案质量，鼓励模型在达到满意置信度水平前重试。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型在高置信度时任务准确率显著更高，低置信度时准确率接近零。提出的TTS方法在保持竞争力的同时显著减少了token消耗。

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够通过语言化置信度分数有效传达不确定性，基于置信度的测试时缩放方法能够优化资源使用效率，在减少计算成本的同时维持性能表现。

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一个针对债务、每股收益和销售额三个核心财务指标的句子级立场检测语料库，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型标注并在严格人工验证下构建。评估了现代大语言模型在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC文件报告和季度财报电话会议记录中的财务叙述对投资者、审计师和监管者非常重要，但其长度、财务术语和微妙语言使得细粒度分析困难。传统的基于大量标注数据的金融情感分析方法成本高昂，难以实现针对特定财务目标的句子级立场检测。

Method: 从Form 10-K年报和财报电话会议记录中提取句子，使用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型标注立场（积极、消极、中性）并经过严格人工验证。系统评估现代大语言模型在零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略下的性能。

Result: 少样本结合思维链提示策略表现最佳，优于监督基线方法。大语言模型在SEC和财报电话会议数据集上的表现存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在金融领域中，无需大量标注数据即可有效利用大语言模型进行目标特定的立场检测，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

Motivation: 现有基准大多忽视了数学辅导所需的诊断学生困难和逐步指导的能力，需要专门评估AI数学辅导技能的基准。

Method: 构建MMTutorBench基准，包含685个围绕教学关键步骤的问题，每个问题配有特定量规，评估三个任务：洞察发现、操作制定和操作执行，使用基于量规的LLM评估方法。

Result: 专有模型与开源模型存在明显性能差距，与人类导师相比仍有很大提升空间，OCR会降低辅导质量，少量样本提示效果有限，基于量规的LLM评估高度可靠。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench既展示了AI数学辅导的难度，也证明了其诊断价值，有助于推进AI辅导技术的发展。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

Conclusion: M4FC数据集填补了多模态事实核查领域的空白，为研究提供了更全面、多样化的基准，并展示了中间任务组合对最终核查性能的影响。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

Result: 实验评估显示，当前最先进的语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，模型无法从用户历史中识别核心意图，且随着问题复杂性增加性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要改进模型在个性化问答中的意图识别能力，IPQA基准测试将为该方向的研究提供支持。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一种基于少量合成数据训练的LLM重排序模型，在推理密集型检索和指令跟随检索任务中表现优异，仅使用传统方法5%的数据量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖大规模微调来适应LLM进行信息重排序任务，计算成本高昂。本文旨在证明现代LLM可以通过最小化、高质量的监督有效适应重排序任务。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性和真实性的重排序示例，使用这些合成数据微调重排序模型LIMRANK。

Result: LIMRANK在BRIGHT（推理密集型检索）和FollowIR（指令跟随检索）两个基准测试中取得竞争性性能，同时训练数据量仅为先前工作的不到5%。

Conclusion: LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道有效，LIMRANK在下游任务（包括科学文献搜索和知识密集型问题解决的检索增强生成）中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别社交媒体上的希望语音（包含能动性和目标导向行为的激励性表达）已成为重要的NLP任务。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在已划分的训练集、开发集和测试集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中，线性核SVM和逻辑回归的宏F1为0.78；transformer模型表现更好，最佳模型加权精度0.82、加权召回率0.80、加权F1 0.79、宏F1 0.79、准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍具竞争力，但transformer架构能检测希望语音的细微语义，在小数据集上表现更优，表明大型transformer和LLM可能在小数据集上有更好表现。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BR-RM模型，将"三思而后行"原则应用于奖励建模，通过两轮思考减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性，在三个挑战性基准测试中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单一标量，导致注意力分散、分析浅薄，存在判断扩散问题。

Method: BR-RM采用两轮思考：第一轮自适应分支选择关键维度并生成证据寻求假设；第二轮执行分支条件化重新思考，针对性测试假设。使用GRPO风格强化学习训练。

Result: 在三个挑战性奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过将一次性评分转换为聚焦的二次思考推理，减少判断扩散，提高对细微但重要错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

Method: 1) 在四个心理学数据集上建立基准性能；2) 微调Transformer模型并解决数值不稳定性和资源约束问题；3) 使用参数高效技术微调生成式LLM作为"人格大脑"；4) 将预测和生成模型架构为可扩展的微服务生态系统。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了整合预测分析与生成对话的完整研发到部署管道，为计算心理学和人类-AI交互的未来研究提供了实用模型。

Abstract: The confluence of Artificial Intelligence and Computational Psychology
presents an opportunity to model, understand, and interact with complex human
psychological states through computational means. This paper presents a
comprehensive, multi-faceted framework designed to bridge the gap between
isolated predictive modeling and an interactive system for psychological
analysis. The methodology encompasses a rigorous, end-to-end development
lifecycle. First, foundational performance benchmarks were established on four
diverse psychological datasets using classical machine learning techniques.
Second, state-of-the-art transformer models were fine-tuned, a process that
necessitated the development of effective solutions to overcome critical
engineering challenges, including the resolution of numerical instability in
regression tasks and the creation of a systematic workflow for conducting
large-scale training under severe resource constraints. Third, a generative
large language model (LLM) was fine-tuned using parameter-efficient techniques
to function as an interactive "Personality Brain." Finally, the entire suite of
predictive and generative models was architected and deployed as a robust,
scalable microservices ecosystem. Key findings include the successful
stabilization of transformer-based regression models for affective computing,
showing meaningful predictive performance where standard approaches failed, and
the development of a replicable methodology for democratizing large-scale AI
research. The significance of this work lies in its holistic approach,
demonstrating a complete research-to-deployment pipeline that integrates
predictive analysis with generative dialogue, thereby providing a practical
model for future research in computational psychology and human-AI interaction.

*Kentaro Ueda,Takehiro Takayanagi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PREFINE框架通过构建伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准，在不更新模型参数或收集直接用户反馈的情况下实现个性化故事生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化方法依赖显式反馈或微调，存在用户负担、数据收集、计算成本和隐私问题。需要一种无需参数更新或直接用户反馈的个性化生成方法。

Method: PREFINE框架从用户交互历史构建伪用户代理，生成用户特定评分标准，让该代理基于这些定制标准对输出进行批评和优化，实现个性化生成。

Result: 在PerDOC和PerMPST数据集上的自动评估显示，PREFINE相比基线方法获得更高的胜率和统计显著分数，且不损害一般故事质量。模型变体分析证实伪用户代理和用户特定评分标准对提升个性化性能至关重要。

Conclusion: PREFINE框架在故事生成中有效实现个性化，且具有扩展到对话系统、教育和推荐等更广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: While recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved the
quality of creative text generation, significant challenges remain in producing
personalized stories that reflect individual user preferences. Conventional
approaches rely on explicit feedback or fine-tuning, which presents practical
issues regarding user burden, data collection, computational costs, and
privacy. In this work, we propose PREFINE (Persona-and-Rubric Guided
Critique-and-Refine), a novel framework that extends the Critique-and-Refine
paradigm to personalization. PREFINE constructs a pseudo-user agent from a
user's interaction history and generates user-specific rubrics (evaluation
criteria). By having this agent critique and refine outputs on the user's
behalf based on these tailored rubrics, our method achieves personalized
generation without requiring parameter updates or direct user feedback. We
conducted a comprehensive evaluation on the PerDOC and PerMPST story datasets.
We designed three baseline methods and several model variants to verify the
contribution of each component of our framework. In automatic evaluations
(LLM-as-a-Judge), PREFINE achieved higher win rates and statistically
significant scores than the baselines, without compromising general story
quality. Analysis of the model variants confirmed that both the pseudo-user
agent and the user-specific rubrics are crucial for enhancing personalization
performance. Beyond story generation, our approach holds potential for enabling
efficient personalization in broader applications, such as dialogue systems,
education, and recommendation.

TL;DR: SIGN方法通过引入轻量级结构来引导多智能体命名约定形成，相比无约束自然语言通信，能实现5.8倍更高的协议达成率和更快收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统中多个LLM智能体交互时，由于约定不一致会导致协调失败，特别是在协作编码和分布式规划等应用中需要可靠、一致的通信，且系统扩展性是核心关注点。

Method: 引入Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN)命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成，比较模式诱导通信与无约束自然语言的效果。

Result: 模式诱导通信比无约束自然语言收敛更快，协议达成率最高提升5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可以作为多智能体协调的简单控制机制，提高效率，在命名游戏之外有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

*Javier Marín*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中存在能力天花板，参数规模扩大至30B时知识检索任务准确率几乎没有提升，而数学基准测试准确率保持在19-20%不变，尽管损失持续下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索解码器自回归语言模型在知识密集型任务中的扩展能力极限，量化不同模型规模下的性能表现，为资源分配决策提供依据。

Method: 系统评估OPT和Pythia模型家族（70M-30B参数），分析知识检索和数学任务的表现，进行注意力干预实验观察模型敏感性。

Result: 知识检索任务准确率随参数增加几乎不变，数学基准准确率保持在19-20%而损失下降31%，注意力模式交换导致性能完全崩溃。

Conclusion: 对于知识密集型应用，OPT和Pythia架构在超过1-2B参数后准确率增益极小，这些发现揭示了特定能力扩展失败的模式。

Abstract: We document empirical capability ceilings in decoder-only autoregressive
language models across knowledge-intensive tasks. Systematic evaluation of OPT
and Pythia model families (70M-30B parameters, spanning 240 times scaling)
reveals that knowledge retrieval tasks show negligible accuracy improvement
despite smooth loss reduction. On MMLU mathematics benchmarks, accuracy remains
flat at 19-20% (below 25% random chance) across all scales while cross-entropy
loss decreases by 31%. In contrast, procedural tasks like arithmetic show
conventional scaling where both metrics improve together. Attention
intervention experiments reveal high sensitivity to perturbation: swapping
attention patterns between models causes catastrophic performance collapse
(complete accuracy loss) rather than graceful degradation. These measurements
have immediate engineering implications: for knowledge-intensive applications
using OPT and Pythia architectures, parameter scaling beyond 1-2B offers
minimal accuracy gains despite continued loss improvement. Our findings
quantify capability-specific scaling failures in these model families to inform
resource allocation decisions. Whether these patterns reflect fundamental
constraints of decoder-only architectures or implementation-specific
limitations remains an open question requiring investigation across diverse
architectural approaches.

*Nannan Shi,Chuanyu Qin,Shipeng Song,Man Luo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型，通过包含详细推理链的训练数据来提升大语言模型在几何推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在文本数学推理上表现良好，但在几何推理任务中性能显著下降，主要因为几何问题的内在复杂性（需要详细图像理解和多步推理）以及现有数据集缺乏规模、多样性和明确推理轨迹。

Method: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集（包含6,243样本的Geo-Thought-6K和10,834样本的Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K），每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、明确推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此数据集训练了GeoThought-MLLM多模态数学推理模型。

Result: GeoThought-MLLM模型在几何任务中超越了现有基准，证明使用Chain-of-Thought数据集训练能够提升模型在领域内和领域外的几何推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过分析失败案例发现，错误主要源于数学概念的错误解释或空间判断错误，通过调用CoT机制可以纠正这些错误并产生正确答案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成模型在组合优化问题中的应用潜力，利用GFlowNets的计算可扩展性优势，为大规模问题提供解决方案。

Method: 使用轨迹平衡损失训练GFlowNets，顺序构建解：为生成树选择边、为路径选择节点、为旅行路线选择城市。

Result: 在多种规模的基准实例上，GFlowNets学习到找到最优解，生成解与经典算法结果匹配，训练收敛性随问题复杂度增加而降低。

Conclusion: 生成模型可以通过学习策略解决组合优化问题，主要优势是计算可扩展性，训练后可摊销计算成本，有望扩展到经典精确方法不可行的大规模问题。

Abstract: This work applies Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to three graph
optimization problems: the Traveling Salesperson Problem, Minimum Spanning
Tree, and Shortest Path. GFlowNets are generative models that learn to sample
solutions proportionally to a reward function. The models are trained using the
Trajectory Balance loss to build solutions sequentially, selecting edges for
spanning trees, nodes for paths, and cities for tours. Experiments on benchmark
instances of varying sizes show that GFlowNets learn to find optimal solutions.
For each problem type, multiple graph configurations with different numbers of
nodes were tested. The generated solutions match those from classical
algorithms (Dijkstra for shortest path, Kruskal for spanning trees, and exact
solvers for TSP). Training convergence depends on problem complexity, with the
number of episodes required for loss stabilization increasing as graph size
grows. Once training converges, the generated solutions match known optima from
classical algorithms across the tested instances. This work demonstrates that
generative models can solve combinatorial optimization problems through learned
policies. The main advantage of this learning-based approach is computational
scalability: while classical algorithms have fixed complexity per instance,
GFlowNets amortize computation through training. With sufficient computational
resources, the framework could potentially scale to larger problem instances
where classical exact methods become infeasible.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性框架下强化学习的计算复杂性，证明在该设置下学习$\epsilon$-最优策略是计算困难的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在比$q^{\pi}$-可实现性更弱但比$q^*$-可实现性更强的假设下，函数逼近自然出现的实际模型中的计算复杂性。

Method: 通过从$\delta$-Max-3SAT和$\delta$-Max-3SAT(b)问题归约到GLinear-$\kappa$-RL（贪婪策略）和SLinear-$\kappa$-RL（softmax策略）实例来建立计算复杂性下界。

Result: 证明了在参数化贪婪策略集下是NP-难的，在softmax策略集下（除非NP=RP）存在指数级下界（在特征向量维度上）。

Conclusion: 部分$q^{\pi}$-可实现性下通常无法获得正面的计算复杂性结果，这与生成访问模型下的$q^{\pi}$-可实现性形成对比。

Abstract: This paper investigates the computational complexity of reinforcement
learning in a novel linear function approximation regime, termed partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability. In this framework, the objective is to learn an
$\epsilon$-optimal policy with respect to a predefined policy set $\Pi$, under
the assumption that all value functions for policies in $\Pi$ are linearly
realizable. The assumptions of this framework are weaker than those in
$q^{\pi}$-realizability but stronger than those in $q^*$-realizability,
providing a practical model where function approximation naturally arises. We
prove that learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in this setting is
computationally hard. Specifically, we establish NP-hardness under a
parameterized greedy policy set (argmax) and show that - unless NP = RP - an
exponential lower bound (in feature vector dimension) holds when the policy set
contains softmax policies, under the Randomized Exponential Time Hypothesis.
Our hardness results mirror those in $q^*$-realizability and suggest
computational difficulty persists even when $\Pi$ is expanded beyond the
optimal policy. To establish this, we reduce from two complexity problems,
$\delta$-Max-3SAT and $\delta$-Max-3SAT(b), to instances of GLinear-$\kappa$-RL
(greedy policy) and SLinear-$\kappa$-RL (softmax policy). Our findings indicate
that positive computational results are generally unattainable in partial
$q^{\pi}$-realizability, in contrast to $q^{\pi}$-realizability under a
generative access model.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用小型开源模型替代大型商业模型进行电子商务意图识别的可行性，通过优化10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型，实现了与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型商业语言模型在部署到专业领域（如电子商务）时面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 使用量化低秩适应（QLoRA）在合成数据集上微调10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型，然后应用后训练量化技术创建GPU优化（GPTQ）和CPU优化（GGUF）版本。

Result: 专用1B模型达到99%准确率，与GPT-4.1性能相当。4位GPTQ减少41%显存使用但推理速度下降82%；GGUF格式在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上内存消耗减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用更合适的选择，能够以极低计算成本实现最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

TL;DR: 提出了Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA)方法，通过两阶段微调对齐输出分布和分布偏移，显著提升LLM模拟调查响应的准确性，减少53.48-69.12%的真实数据需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本方法存在提示敏感性和低准确性问题，传统微调方法过度拟合训练集分布，无法产生比训练集更准确的结果，偏离了使用LLM模拟调查响应的初衷。

Method: 提出Distribution Shift Alignment (DSA)两阶段微调方法，学习分布如何变化而非拟合训练数据，对齐输出分布和不同背景下的分布偏移。

Result: 在五个公开调查数据集上，DSA始终优于其他方法，能够提供比训练数据更接近真实分布的结果，显著减少53.48-69.12%的真实数据需求。

Conclusion: DSA在准确性、鲁棒性和数据节省方面表现优异，证明了其在调查模拟中的有效性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human survey
responses, potentially reducing the cost of large-scale data collection.
However, existing zero-shot methods suffer from prompt sensitivity and low
accuracy, while conventional fine-tuning approaches mostly fit the training set
distributions and struggle to produce results more accurate than the training
set itself, which deviates from the original goal of using LLMs to simulate
survey responses. Building on this observation, we introduce Distribution Shift
Alignment (DSA), a two-stage fine-tuning method that aligns both the output
distributions and the distribution shifts across different backgrounds. By
learning how these distributions change rather than fitting training data, DSA
can provide results substantially closer to the true distribution than the
training data. Empirically, DSA consistently outperforms other methods on five
public survey datasets. We further conduct a comprehensive comparison covering
accuracy, robustness, and data savings. DSA reduces the required real data by
53.48-69.12%, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in survey
simulation.

Abstract: Math word problem (MWP) serves as a fundamental research topic in artificial
intelligence (AI) dating back to 1960s. This research aims to advance the
reasoning abilities of AI by mirroring the human-like cognitive intelligence.
The mainstream technological paradigm has evolved from the early rule-based
methods, to deep learning models, and is rapidly advancing towards large
language models. However, the field still lacks a systematic taxonomy for the
MWP survey along with a discussion of current development trends. Therefore, in
this paper, we aim to comprehensively review related research in MWP solving
through the lens of human cognition, to demonstrate how recent AI models are
advancing in simulating human cognitive abilities. Specifically, we summarize 5
crucial cognitive abilities for MWP solving, including Problem Understanding,
Logical Organization, Associative Memory, Critical Thinking, and Knowledge
Learning. Focused on these abilities, we review two mainstream MWP models in
recent 10 years: neural network solvers, and LLM based solvers, and discuss the
core human-like abilities they demonstrated in their intricate problem-solving
process. Moreover, we rerun all the representative MWP solvers and supplement
their performance on 5 mainstream benchmarks for a unified comparison. To the
best of our knowledge, this survey first comprehensively analyzes the
influential MWP research of the past decade from the perspective of human
reasoning cognition and provides an integrative overall comparison across
existing approaches. We hope it can inspire further research in AI reasoning.

### [335] [LightAgent: Mobile Agentic Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22009)
*Yangqin Jiang,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LightAgent是一个移动GUI代理解决方案，通过设备-云协作平衡本地模型成本效益和云端模型能力，在移动平台上实现高效GUI交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动GUI代理面临的困境：完全本地模型（4B或更小）性能不足，而能力强的模型（7B以上）要么太大无法部署，要么成本过高（仅云端闭源MLLMs）。

Method: 通过两阶段SFT->GRPO训练增强Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型，集成高效长推理机制利用历史交互，默认本地执行，仅通过实时复杂度评估将困难子任务升级到云端处理。

Result: 在AndroidLab基准测试和多样化应用上，LightAgent达到或接近更大模型的性能，同时显著降低云成本。

Conclusion: LightAgent通过设备-云协作策略有效解决了移动GUI代理的性能与成本平衡问题，为移动平台提供了可行的代理基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), building
GUI agent systems has become an increasingly promising direction-especially for
mobile platforms, given their rich app ecosystems and intuitive touch
interactions. Yet mobile GUI agents face a critical dilemma: truly on-device
models (4B or smaller) lack sufficient performance, while capable models
(starting from 7B) are either too large for mobile deployment or prohibitively
costly (e.g., cloud-only closed-source MLLMs). To resolve this, we propose
LightAgent, a mobile agentic foundation model solution that leverages
device-cloud collaboration to tap the cost-efficiency of on-device models and
the high capability of cloud models, while avoiding their drawbacks.
Specifically, LightAgent enhances Qwen2.5-VL-3B via two-stage SFT->GRPO
training on synthetic GUI data for strong decision-making, integrates an
efficient long-reasoning mechanism to utilize historical interactions under
tight resources, and defaults to on-device execution-only escalating
challenging subtasks to the cloud via real-time complexity assessment.
Experiments on the online AndroidLab benchmark and diverse apps show LightAgent
matches or nears larger models, with a significant reduction in cloud costs.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can already identify patterns and reason
effectively, yet their variable accuracy hampers adoption in high-stakes
decision-making applications. In this paper, we study this issue from a venture
capital perspective by predicting idea-stage startup success based on founder
traits. (i) To build a reliable prediction model, we introduce LLM-AR, a
pipeline inspired by neural-symbolic systems that distils LLM-generated
heuristics into probabilistic rules executed by the ProbLog automated-reasoning
engine. (ii) An iterative policy-evolution loop incorporates association-rule
mining to progressively refine the prediction rules.
  On unseen folds, LLM-AR achieves 59.5% precision and 8.7% recall, 5.9x the
random baseline precision, while exposing every decision path for human
inspection. The framework is interpretable and tunable via hyperparameters,
showing promise to extend into other domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 在部分可观测环境中，结合自监督预测编码模块的元强化学习能够学习到更紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态表示，相比传统元强化学习具有更好的表示学习能力和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元强化学习虽然能获得接近贝叶斯最优的策略，但往往无法学习到紧凑、可解释的贝叶斯最优信念状态，这种表示效率低下可能限制智能体的适应性和泛化能力。

Method: 将自监督预测编码模块集成到元强化学习中，受神经科学中的预测编码理论和深度强化学习中辅助预测目标的启发。

Result: 在状态机模拟中，带有预测模块的元强化学习在各种任务中都能生成更可解释的表示，更好地近似贝叶斯最优信念状态。在需要主动信息搜索的挑战性任务中，只有带预测模块的方法能成功学习最优表示和策略。

Conclusion: 预测学习作为指导原则，在智能体导航部分可观测性时能够促进有效的表示学习，更好的表示学习带来改进的泛化能力。

Abstract: Learning a compact representation of history is critical for planning and
generalization in partially observable environments. While meta-reinforcement
learning (RL) agents can attain near Bayes-optimal policies, they often fail to
learn the compact, interpretable Bayes-optimal belief states. This
representational inefficiency potentially limits the agent's adaptability and
generalization capacity. Inspired by predictive coding in neuroscience--which
suggests that the brain predicts sensory inputs as a neural implementation of
Bayesian inference--and by auxiliary predictive objectives in deep RL, we
investigate whether integrating self-supervised predictive coding modules into
meta-RL can facilitate learning of Bayes-optimal representations. Through state
machine simulation, we show that meta-RL with predictive modules consistently
generates more interpretable representations that better approximate
Bayes-optimal belief states compared to conventional meta-RL across a wide
variety of tasks, even when both achieve optimal policies. In challenging tasks
requiring active information seeking, only meta-RL with predictive modules
successfully learns optimal representations and policies, whereas conventional
meta-RL struggles with inadequate representation learning. Finally, we
demonstrate that better representation learning leads to improved
generalization. Our results strongly suggest the role of predictive learning as
a guiding principle for effective representation learning in agents navigating
partial observability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过系统级软硬件协同设计，在满足实时性能要求的前提下，降低纯硬件方案的成本，避免使用高端处理器的纯软件方案的高昂开销。

Method: 使用SpecC方法学对PCM-to-PWM转换器进行建模和探索，通过系统级评估和快速功能仿真来推导软硬件划分方案。

Result: 成功实现了满足实时约束的软硬件划分方案，相比纯硬件方案降低了估计成本，同时避免了纯软件方案的高开销。

Conclusion: 即使对于中等复杂度的设计，系统级协同设计也能提供早期架构洞察、快速验证和有价值的成本/性能权衡分析。

Abstract: We present a case study applying the SpecC methodology within a system-level
hardware/software co-design flow to a PCM-to-PWM converter, the core of a
Class-D audio amplifier. The converter was modeled and explored with SpecC
methodology to derive an HW/SW partition. Using system-level estimates and fast
functional simulation, we evaluated mappings that meet real-time constraints
while reducing estimated cost of an all-hardware solution and avoiding the
expense of a purely software implementation on a high-end processor. Despite
the design's moderate complexity, the results underline the value of
system-level co-design for early architectural insight, rapid validation, and
actionable cost/performance trade-offs. [Original work from 2005; formatting

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出从预测准确性转向因果解释的机器学习范式转变，引入能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)作为可干预的因果表示框架，使模型内部机制可编辑和可测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习系统虽然预测性能优异，但缺乏因果透明性，无法对特定机制进行外科手术式干预。作者认为智能的本质是构建和修正可证伪的因果解释。

Method: 提出能量结构化因果模型(ESCMs)，将机制表示为约束(能量函数或向量场)而非显式输入输出映射，干预通过局部约束修改实现。

Result: ESCMs在温和条件下恢复标准SCM语义，提供形式化语言用于因果推理，使内部结构在解释层面可操作。

Conclusion: 该工作为追求理解而不仅仅是预测的系统提供了因果推理的形式化语言，实现了从预测到因果解释的范式转变。

Abstract: Contemporary machine learning optimizes for predictive accuracy, yet systems
that achieve state of the art performance remain causally opaque: their
internal representations provide no principled handle for intervention. We can
retrain such models, but we cannot surgically edit specific mechanisms while
holding others fixed, because learned latent variables lack causal semantics.
We argue for a conceptual reorientation: intelligence is the ability to build
and refine explanations, falsifiable claims about manipulable structure that
specify what changes and what remains invariant under intervention.
Explanations subsume prediction but demand more: causal commitments that can be
independently tested and corrected at the level of mechanisms. We introduce
computational explanations, mappings from observations to intervention ready
causal accounts. We instantiate these explanations with Energy Structured
Causal Models (ESCMs), in which mechanisms are expressed as constraints (energy
functions or vector fields) rather than explicit input output maps, and
interventions act by local surgery on those constraints. This shift makes
internal structure manipulable at the level where explanations live: which
relations must hold, which can change, and what follows when they do. We
provide concrete instantiations of the structural-causal principles LAP and ICM
in the ESCM context, and also argue that empirical risk minimization
systematically produces fractured, entangled representations, a failure we
analyze as gauge ambiguity in encoder energy pairs. Finally, we show that under
mild conditions, ESCMs recover standard SCM semantics. Building on Part I's
principles (LAP, ICM, CAP) and its definition of intelligence as
explanation-building under criticism, this paper offers a formal language for
causal reasoning in systems that aspire to understand, not merely to predict.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型训练成本高昂（GPT-4需50-60GWh能源），存在幻觉问题，且无法在关键应用领域部署。相比之下，人脑仅消耗20W功率，需要开发更高效、更智能的AI系统。

Method: 提出开发轻量级领域专用多模态模型，这些模型能够在动态环境中进行推理、规划和决策，利用实时数据和先验知识，并具备持续学习和进化能力。

Result: 设想了未来AI系统的蓝图：从当前的大型模型转向能够应对不确定性的高效能领域专用智能体，需要硬件能效比现有技术提升1000倍以上。

Conclusion: 下一代AI将实现从数据驱动的大型模型到能够推理思考的高效能领域专用智能体的转变，这需要硬件和算法的协同创新。

Abstract: The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has taken a tight hold on broad
aspects of society, industry, business, and governance in ways that dictate the
prosperity and might of the world's economies. The AI market size is projected
to grow from 189 billion USD in 2023 to 4.8 trillion USD by 2033. Currently, AI
is dominated by large language models that exhibit linguistic and visual
intelligence. However, training these models requires a massive amount of data
scraped from the web as well as large amounts of energy (50--60 GWh to train
GPT-4). Despite these costs, these models often hallucinate, a characteristic
that prevents them from being deployed in critical application domains. In
contrast, the human brain consumes only 20~W of power. What is needed is the
next level of AI evolution in which lightweight domain-specific multimodal
models with higher levels of intelligence can reason, plan, and make decisions
in dynamic environments with real-time data and prior knowledge, while learning
continuously and evolving in ways that enhance future decision-making
capability. This will define the next wave of AI, progressing from today's
large models, trained with vast amounts of data, to nimble energy-efficient
domain-specific agents that can reason and think in a world full of
uncertainty. To support such agents, hardware will need to be reimagined to
allow energy efficiencies greater than 1000x over the state of the art. Such a
vision of future AI systems is developed in this work.

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，主张从BCI扩展到BAC范式，重新定义智能体为主动协作伙伴，要求关注伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架。

Result: 提出了脑-智能体协作（BAC）的新范式概念，强调智能体应作为主动协作伙伴，而非被动处理器，需要确保系统的安全性、可信性和有效性。

Conclusion: 脑机接口领域需要向脑-智能体协作范式扩展，将智能体重新定义为主动协作伙伴，并建立相应的伦理、可靠性和协作框架，以确保系统安全、可信和有效。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

Abstract: AI psychometrics evaluates AI systems in roles that traditionally require
emotional judgment and ethical consideration. Prior work often reuses human
trait inventories (Big Five, \hexaco) or ad hoc personas, limiting behavioral
realism and domain relevance. We propose a framework that (1) uses situational
judgment tests (SJTs) from realistic scenarios to probe domain-specific
competencies; (2) integrates industrial-organizational and personality
psychology to design sophisticated personas which include behavioral and
psychological descriptors, life history, and social and emotional functions;
and (3) employs structured generation with population demographic priors and
memoir inspired narratives, encoded with Pydantic schemas. In a law enforcement
assistant case study, we construct a rich dataset of personas drawn across 8
persona archetypes and SJTs across 11 attributes, and analyze behaviors across
subpopulation and scenario slices. The dataset spans 8,500 personas, 4,000
SJTs, and 300,000 responses. We will release the dataset and all code to the

Conclusion: Dopamine优化器不仅找到了稳健的解决方案，性能与最先进的机器学习优化器相当，而且在神经生物学上更加合理，为神经网络的训练提供了一种高效且生物学可信的替代方法。

Abstract: Solving the synaptic Credit Assignment Problem(CAP) is central to learning in
both biological and artificial neural systems. Finding an optimal solution for
synaptic CAP means setting the synaptic weights that assign credit to each
neuron for influencing the final output and behavior of neural networks or
animals. Gradient-based methods solve this problem in artificial neural
networks using back-propagation, however, not in the most efficient way. For
instance, back-propagation requires a chain of top-down gradient computations.
This leads to an expensive optimization process in terms of computing power and
memory linked with well-known weight transport and update locking problems. To
address these shortcomings, we take a NeuroAI approach and draw inspiration
from neural Reinforcement Learning to develop a derivative-free optimizer for
training neural networks, Dopamine. Dopamine is developed for Weight
Perturbation (WP) learning that exploits stochastic updating of weights towards
optima. It achieves this by minimizing the regret, a form of Reward Prediction
Error (RPE) between the expected outcome from the perturbed model and the
actual outcome from the unperturbed model. We use this RPE to adjust the
learning rate in the network (i.e., creating an adaptive learning rate
strategy, similar to the role of dopamine in the brain). We tested the Dopamine
optimizer for training multi-layered perceptrons for XOR tasks, and recurrent
neural networks for chaotic time series forecasting. Dopamine-trained models
demonstrate accelerated convergence and outperform standard WP, and give
comparable performance to gradient-based algorithms, while consuming
significantly less computation and memory. Overall, the Dopamine optimizer not
only finds robust solutions and comparable performance to the state-of-the-art
Machine Learning optimizers but is also neurobiologically more plausible.

Conclusion: OptiTree通过树搜索和自适应问题分解有效解决了复杂运筹学问题的建模挑战，显著提升了建模性能。

Abstract: Optimization modeling is one of the most crucial but technical parts of
operations research (OR). To automate the modeling process, existing works have
leveraged large language models (LLMs), prompting them to break down tasks into
steps for generating variables, constraints, and objectives. However, due to
the highly complex mathematical structures inherent in OR problems, standard
fixed-step decomposition often fails to achieve high performance. To address
this challenge, we introduce OptiTree, a novel tree search approach designed to
enhance modeling capabilities for complex problems through adaptive problem
decomposition into simpler subproblems. Specifically, we develop a modeling
tree that organizes a wide range of OR problems based on their hierarchical
problem taxonomy and complexity, with each node representing a problem category
and containing relevant high-level modeling thoughts. Given a problem to model,
we recurrently search the tree to identify a series of simpler subproblems and
synthesize the global modeling thoughts by adaptively integrating the
hierarchical thoughts. Experiments show that OptiTree significantly improves
the modeling accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art, achieving over 10\%
improvements on the challenging benchmarks. The code is released at

TL;DR: 提出了PACR（渐进上升置信度奖励），一种密集的模型内在奖励，通过追踪模型对正确答案置信度的上升趋势来指导强化学习中的中间推理步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索过程缓慢。需要一种密集的奖励信号来加速推理探索。

Method: 使用模型对正确答案置信度的上升趋势作为密集奖励信号，约束探索空间到逻辑合理的推理区域。

Result: PACR加速了探索过程，用更少的轨迹达到奖励饱和，在多个基准测试中取得了改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑造信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these

limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in
non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the
VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing
multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics
and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while
demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发可解释的预测框架，将领域文献知识与大语言模型结合，提升卡车驾驶风险预测的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 构建包含LLM驱动推理核心、文献处理流水线和结果评估器的框架，使用299篇领域文献构建知识库，在真实卡车驾驶风险数据集上进行微调。

Result: LIFT LLM在召回率上比基准模型提升26.7%，F1分数提升10.1%，变量重要性排序与基准模型一致，并能识别经PERMANOVA验证的关键风险变量组合。

Conclusion: LIFT LLM框架成功整合文献知识，在保持预测准确性的同时提供稳健的可解释性，展示了在数据驱动知识发现方面的潜力。

Abstract: This study proposes an interpretable prediction framework with
literature-informed fine-tuned (LIFT) LLMs for truck driving risk prediction.
The framework integrates an LLM-driven Inference Core that predicts and
explains truck driving risk, a Literature Processing Pipeline that filters and
summarizes domain-specific literature into a literature knowledge base, and a
Result Evaluator that evaluates the prediction performance as well as the
interpretability of the LIFT LLM. After fine-tuning on a real-world truck
driving risk dataset, the LIFT LLM achieved accurate risk prediction,
outperforming benchmark models by 26.7% in recall and 10.1% in F1-score.
Furthermore, guided by the literature knowledge base automatically constructed
from 299 domain papers, the LIFT LLM produced variable importance ranking
consistent with that derived from the benchmark model, while demonstrating
robustness in interpretation results to various data sampling conditions. The
LIFT LLM also identified potential risky scenarios by detecting key combination
of variables in truck driving risk, which were verified by PERMANOVA tests.
Finally, we demonstrated the contribution of the literature knowledge base and
the fine-tuning process in the interpretability of the LIFT LLM, and discussed
the potential of the LIFT LLM in data-driven knowledge discovery.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DynaSolidGeo是第一个用于评估视觉语言模型真实空间推理能力的动态基准，专注于立体几何问题，通过半自动标注流程构建，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成无限多样的多模态实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数多模态数学推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集容易导致数据污染和记忆问题，且仅通过最终答案评估模型，忽略了推理过程。

Method: 通过半自动标注流程构建DynaSolidGeo基准，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成无限多样的多模态文本-视觉实例，并基于专家标注的推理链进行过程评估。

Result: 实验表明，代表性开源和闭源视觉语言模型在性能上存在巨大差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高水平空间智能的任务（如心理旋转和可视化）上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 重新审视现有研究关于LLMs在复杂推理问题上失败的发现，通过构建可扩展复杂度的数据集来更准确地评估大型推理模型的真实能力。

Method: 开发了Deep Reasoning Dataset (DeepRD)数据集，包含可生成无限复杂度示例的生成过程，用于评估模型在图连通性和自然语言证明规划任务上的表现。

Result: 大型推理模型在足够复杂度时性能急剧下降且无法泛化，虽然大多数现实世界示例落在其成功范围内，但长尾分布暴露了显著的失败风险。

Conclusion: 分析强调了大型推理模型的近期实用性，同时指出需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Motivation: 理解大型推理模型（LRMs）涌现的推理能力是一个重要但困难的开放问题，这对于改进训练和理解模型鲁棒性具有重要应用价值。

Method: 采用无记忆有限状态机（FSM）来近似LRMs的层次化推理动态，识别出一组离散推理状态（初始化、演绎、增强策略、不确定性估计、回溯、最终结论），并将推理轨迹表示为状态图中的转移序列。

Result: FSM分析揭示了不同模型在推理方法上的明显差异和潜在缺陷，提供了评估和改进LLM推理的新视角。

Conclusion: FSM框架为系统分析、解释和可视化不同模型处理问题的方式提供了系统方法，能够揭示不同的推理模式和潜在缺陷。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 随着LLM在代理环境中部署，需要评估其在多轮、多方任务中的协作能力。现有LLM代理倾向于忽略伙伴的干预，这使得提高群体共识变得困难。

Method: 使用改进动作MDP框架分析标准AI代理的次优行为，提出ICR算法训练共识最优的协作代理，使其能智能收集伙伴干预提供的信息。

Result: 在多个协作任务环境中的实验表明，ICR平均能更好地促进成功的共识收敛，并在任务中探索更多样化的解决方案。

Conclusion: ICR算法能有效解决LLM代理在协作任务中忽略伙伴干预的问题，提高群体共识对齐和协作效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly bring deployed in agentic
settings where they act as collaborators with humans. Therefore, it is
increasingly important to be able to evaluate their abilities to collaborate
effectively in multi-turn, multi-party tasks. In this paper, we build on the AI
alignment and safe interruptability literature to offer novel theoretical
insights on collaborative behavior between LLM-driven collaborator agents and
an intervention agent. Our goal is to learn an ideal partner-aware collaborator
that increases the group's common-ground (CG)-alignment on task-relevant
propositions-by intelligently collecting information provided in interventions
by a partner agent.We show how LLM agents trained using standard RLHF and
related approaches are naturally inclined to ignore possibly well-meaning
interventions, which makes increasing group common ground non-trivial in this
setting. We employ a two-player Modified-Action MDP to examine this suboptimal
behavior of standard AI agents, and propose Interruptible Collaborative
Roleplayer (ICR)-a novel partner-aware learning algorithm to train CG-optimal
collaborators. Experiments on multiple collaborative task environments show
that ICR, on average, is more capable of promoting successful CG convergence
and exploring more diverse solutions in such tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了OFFSIDE基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型中的错误信息遗忘能力，基于足球转会谣言构建了包含15.68K条记录的数据集，揭示了当前方法在视觉谣言、遗忘可恢复性和提示攻击方面的显著脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的发展加剧了数据隐私担忧，而现有的机器遗忘基准在图像多样性、准确性和评估场景方面存在不足，无法捕捉现实应用的复杂性。

Method: 构建了基于足球转会谣言的OFFSIDE基准数据集，包含四个测试集来评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性，支持选择性遗忘、纠正性重学习以及单模态遗忘等高级设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失败；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易被恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

TL;DR: ATOM是一个自适应优化的方法，通过将文档拆分为原子事实来构建和持续更新时序知识图谱，显著提高了提取的完整性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了现实世界数据的动态性和时效性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不完整的问题。

Method: 将输入文档拆分为最小自包含的原子事实，构建原子时序知识图谱，采用双时间建模区分信息观察时间和有效时间，并并行合并结果。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的完整性提升、约17%的稳定性改善以及超过90%的延迟减少。

Conclusion: ATOM展示了在动态时序知识图谱构建方面强大的可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个分析上下文学习性能的新框架，通过理论分析和实验验证，揭示了预训练数据分布与查询任务分布之间的差异如何通过上下文调整来提升预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型展现出强大的上下文学习能力，但理论上尚不清楚这种能力如何产生，特别是预训练过程和上下文构建等关键因素的确切作用。

Method: 构建了一个包含单层transformer的简单示例，然后扩展到更一般情况，推导出ICL性能、上下文长度以及预训练与查询任务分布之间KL散度的精确关系，并通过实验验证理论结果。

Result: 当预训练数据分布与查询任务分布不同时，适当构建的上下文可以将输出分布向查询任务分布偏移，以可量化的方式提高查询主题的预测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个理论框架来理解上下文学习的机制，明确了上下文在弥合预训练与目标任务分布差异中的关键作用，并量化了相关因素的影响。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated a strong ability to learn
from context, known as in-context learning (ICL). Despite a surge of recent
applications that leverage such capabilities, it is by no means clear, at least
theoretically, how the ICL capabilities arise, and in particular, what is the
precise role played by key factors such as pre-training procedure as well as
context construction. In this work, we propose a new framework to analyze the
ICL performance, for a class of realistic settings, which includes network
architectures, data encoding, data generation, and prompt construction process.
As a first step, we construct a simple example with a one-layer transformer,
and show an interesting result, namely when the pre-train data distribution is
different from the query task distribution, a properly constructed context can
shift the output distribution towards the query task distribution, in a
quantifiable manner, leading to accurate prediction on the query topic. We then
extend the findings in the previous step to a more general case, and derive the
precise relationship between ICL performance, context length and the KL
divergence between pre-train and query task distribution. Finally, we provide
experiments to validate our theoretical results.

TL;DR: CLIN-LLM是一个安全约束的混合管道系统，集成了多模态患者编码、不确定性校准的疾病分类和检索增强的治疗生成，在症状到疾病分类和治疗推荐方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的医疗系统缺乏医学基础且无法量化不确定性，导致输出不安全。需要开发一个能够确保临床安全性和人类监督的决策支持框架。

Method: 使用BioBERT在Symptom2Disease数据集上微调，结合Focal Loss和Monte Carlo Dropout进行不确定性校准；使用Biomedical Sentence-BERT从MedDialog语料库检索相关对话；通过微调的FLAN-T5模型生成个性化治疗建议，并使用RxNorm进行抗生素管理和药物相互作用筛查。

Result: 达到98%的准确率和F1分数，比ClinicalBERT提升7.1%；78%的top-5检索精度；临床医生评分4.2/5；不安全抗生素建议比GPT-5减少67%。

Conclusion: CLIN-LLM展示了鲁棒性、可解释性和临床安全性，为资源有限的医疗环境提供了可部署的人类在环决策支持框架。

Abstract: Accurate symptom-to-disease classification and clinically grounded treatment
recommendations remain challenging, particularly in heterogeneous patient
settings with high diagnostic risk. Existing large language model (LLM)-based
systems often lack medical grounding and fail to quantify uncertainty,
resulting in unsafe outputs. We propose CLIN-LLM, a safety-constrained hybrid
pipeline that integrates multimodal patient encoding, uncertainty-calibrated
disease classification, and retrieval-augmented treatment generation. The
framework fine-tunes BioBERT on 1,200 clinical cases from the Symptom2Disease
dataset and incorporates Focal Loss with Monte Carlo Dropout to enable
confidence-aware predictions from free-text symptoms and structured vitals.
Low-certainty cases (18%) are automatically flagged for expert review, ensuring
human oversight. For treatment generation, CLIN-LLM employs Biomedical
Sentence-BERT to retrieve top-k relevant dialogues from the 260,000-sample
MedDialog corpus. The retrieved evidence and patient context are fed into a
fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model for personalized treatment generation, followed by
post-processing with RxNorm for antibiotic stewardship and drug-drug
interaction (DDI) screening. CLIN-LLM achieves 98% accuracy and F1 score,
outperforming ClinicalBERT by 7.1% (p < 0.001), with 78% top-5 retrieval
precision and a clinician-rated validity of 4.2 out of 5. Unsafe antibiotic
suggestions are reduced by 67% compared to GPT-5. These results demonstrate
CLIN-LLM's robustness, interpretability, and clinical safety alignment. The
proposed system provides a deployable, human-in-the-loop decision support
framework for resource-limited healthcare environments. Future work includes
integrating imaging and lab data, multilingual extensions, and clinical trial
validation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SwiftSolve是一个复杂度感知的多智能体系统，用于竞争性编程，通过算法规划、经验分析和复杂度引导的修复相结合，在满足正确性的同时确保程序在时间和内存预算内运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的程序虽然能通过单元测试，但经常违反竞赛的时间和内存限制，需要一种能够同时保证正确性和效率的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体系统架构，包括规划器、静态剪枝器、编码器、性能分析器和复杂度分析器，通过版本化JSON通信，结合算法规划和经验性能分析来生成和优化代码。

Result: 在26个问题上的评估显示，SwiftSolve在第一次尝试时达到61.54%的成功率，三次尝试内达到80.77%的成功率，平均运行时间12.40秒，运行级别成功率为73.08%。相比Claude Opus 4，运行成功率从52.6%提升到73.1%。

Conclusion: 性能分析和复杂度引导的重新规划能够有效减少低效率问题，同时保持准确性，证明了在竞争性编程中同时考虑正确性和效率的重要性。

Abstract: Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy
unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present
SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming
that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and
complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software
environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles
such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner
proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk
plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on
a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a
Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a
complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder.
Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration
caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10
Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains
pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with
marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate
run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly
resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against
Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at
approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness
(pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence
of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that
profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成模板化响应时浪费大量计算资源，增加了不必要的成本和延迟，需要解决这种低效问题。

Method: 使用首个生成token的对数概率分布作为信号，通过轻量级k-NN分类器预测整个响应的性质（实质性回答vs模板化响应）。

Result: 在不同规模模型上的实验表明，首个token对数概率向量能形成明显可分离的聚类，准确预测响应类型，实现高精度分类。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且计算量极小的技术，通过早期终止或重定向优化LLM推理，为更高效和可持续的LLM部署提供了直接路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often expend significant computational resources
generating boilerplate responses, such as refusals, simple acknowledgements and
casual greetings, which adds unnecessary cost and latency. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型的新型城市发展度量指标Atlas Urban Index，利用Sentinel-2卫星图像，通过时间序列处理和参考图像策略，克服了传统指标在大规模城市监测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NDBI在准确捕捉城市发展方面存在困难，受大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素影响，阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2图像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以获得云层覆盖最少的代表性图像；采用两种策略确保评分一致性：(i)提供代表不同城市化水平的参考图像集，(ii)提供最近的历史图像以保持时间一致性和减轻云相关噪声。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指标。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指标的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

Result: 在六个权威基准测试中，RaCoT比RankRAG和Self-RAG等强基线方法表现更好，提升了0.9-2.4个百分点。在对抗性测试中性能下降仅8.6%，远优于其他方法超过15%的下降。具有低延迟(3.12s)和低token开销(11.54)。

Conclusion: RaCoT将RAG范式从"事后上下文清理"重新定义为"先验塑造判别推理"，为实时、资源受限部署提供了高效且可靠的AI系统路径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) faces a core bottleneck with
knowledge-sparse and semantically ambiguous long-tail queries, where retrieval
noise distorts reasoning and necessitates costly post-processing. To tackle
this, we propose RaCoT (Retrieval-aware Contrastive-of-Thought), a novel
framework that shifts contrastive thinking to the pre-retrieval stage. By
automatically generating a semantically adjacent yet differently answered
contrastive question and extracting a $\Delta$-Prompt to capture their key
differences, RaCoT guides the model to proactively focus on the ``critical
details that determine answer divergence." This approach allows it to suppress
semantic interference within a single retrieval pass, overcoming the
theoretical bottleneck of single-vector queries that struggle to simultaneously
encode signals for what to attend to and what to ignore. On six authoritative
benchmarks, including PopQA and TriviaQA-unfiltered, RaCoT outperforms strong
baselines like RankRAG and Self-RAG by 0.9-2.4 percentage points. It exhibits
superior robustness, with a performance drop of only 8.6\% in adversarial
tests, far surpassing the over 15\% degradation in other methods. Furthermore,
its low latency (3.12s) and token overhead (11.54) place it on the
accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, while ablation studies validate the
necessity of each component. Ultimately, RaCoT reframes the RAG paradigm from
``post-hoc context cleaning" to ``a priori shaping of discriminative
reasoning", offering an efficient and robust path toward reliable AI systems
for real-time, resource-constrained deployments.

*Urja Kohli,Aditi Singh,Arun Sharma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了五个主流大语言模型（Gemini、DeepSeek、Claude、GPT和LLaMA）在性能准确性、伦理偏见缓解和可用性集成三个关键维度的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司不断改进大语言模型，了解不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，这些差异源于它们不同的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成，对五个顶级LLM进行比较评估。

Result: 发现Claude在道德推理方面表现良好，Gemini在多模态能力和强伦理框架方面更优，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重使用体验。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效率、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据各自优势选择最适合的模型来最大化利用其特点。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: 开发了一个事实验证框架，通过交叉检查LLM输出与多个知识源来实时捕获和纠正幻觉错误，将幻觉减少67%，同时保持响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在幻觉问题，会自信地生成听起来合理但错误的信息，这成为在需要准确性的现实应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献来验证生成的事实声明，检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持响应的自然流畅性。

Result: 测试显示幻觉减少67%，医疗、金融和科学研究领域的领域专家对纠正后输出的满意度达到89%，相比未验证的LLM响应有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不能出错的应用中使LLM更可信提供了一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Jarvis是一个通过个人KV-Cache检索实现个性化AI助手的创新框架，在视觉问答和纯文本任务中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么学习一组概念标记，要么训练VLM使用用户特定信息，但都难以生成准确答案作为个性化助手。

Method: 将用户特定信息存储在文本和视觉token的KV-Cache中，通过检索相关KV-Cache来确保回答准确性。文本token通过总结用户信息生成元数据，视觉token通过提取用户图像中的独特图像块生成。

Result: Jarvis能够提供更准确的响应，特别是在依赖特定局部细节时，在多个数据集的视觉问答和纯文本任务中取得最先进结果。

Conclusion: Jarvis为个性化AI助手提供了一条实用路径，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: The rapid development of Vision-language models (VLMs) enables open-ended
perception and reasoning. Recent works have started to investigate how to adapt
general-purpose VLMs into personalized assistants. Even commercial models such
as ChatGPT now support model personalization by incorporating user-specific
information. However, existing methods either learn a set of concept tokens or
train a VLM to utilize user-specific information. However, both pipelines
struggle to generate accurate answers as personalized assistants. We introduce
Jarvis, an innovative framework for a personalized AI assistant through
personal KV-Cache retrieval, which stores user-specific information in the
KV-Caches of both textual and visual tokens. The textual tokens are created by
summarizing user information into metadata, while the visual tokens are
produced by extracting distinct image patches from the user's images. When
answering a question, Jarvis first retrieves related KV-Caches from personal
storage and uses them to ensure accuracy in responses. We also introduce a
fine-grained benchmark built with the same distinct image patch mining
pipeline, emphasizing accurate question answering based on fine-grained
user-specific information. Jarvis is capable of providing more accurate
responses, particularly when they depend on specific local details. Jarvis
achieves state-of-the-art results in both visual question answering and
text-only tasks across multiple datasets, indicating a practical path toward
personalized AI assistants. The code and dataset will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理开发缺乏对人类工作方式的理解，需要揭示代理的专业能力和在不同工作流程中可扮演的角色。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，并在数据分析、工程、计算、写作和设计等技能上直接比较人类与代理的表现。

Result: 代理在任务执行中过度依赖程序化方法，工作质量较低且存在数据伪造问题，但速度比人类快88.3%，成本低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: 代理与人类工作流程存在显著差异，建议将易于编程的任务委托给代理以实现高效协作，同时需要解决其质量问题和数据伪造行为。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

Motivation: Microsoft Copilot套件作为各种代理的通用入口点，需要强大的编排器来将用户提示的任务分发给正确的代理。

Method: 使用Agentic Meta-orchestrator（AMO），利用元学习训练的决策树模型来决定不同代理/模型间的最佳推理策略。

Result: 通过两个生产用例展示了AMO的有效性：Microsoft 365电子商务Copilot和代码合规性Copilot。

Conclusion: AMO能够有效处理多任务和可扩展代理，为Copilot服务提供强大的编排能力。

Abstract: Microsoft Copilot suites serve as the universal entry point for various
agents skilled in handling important tasks, ranging from assisting a customer
with product purchases to detecting vulnerabilities in corporate programming
code. Each agent can be powered by language models, software engineering
operations, such as database retrieval, and internal \& external knowledge. The
repertoire of a copilot can expand dynamically with new agents. This requires a
robust orchestrator that can distribute tasks from user prompts to the right
agents. In this work, we propose an Agentic Meta-orchestrator (AMO) for
handling multiple tasks and scalable agents in copilot services, which can
provide both natural language and action responses. We will also demonstrate
the planning that leverages meta-learning, i.e., a trained decision tree model
for deciding the best inference strategy among various agents/models. We
showcase the effectiveness of our AMO through two production use cases:
Microsoft 365 (M365) E-Commerce Copilot and code compliance copilot. M365
E-Commerce Copilot advertises Microsoft products to external customers to
promote sales success. The M365 E-Commerce Copilot provides up-to-date product
information and connects to multiple agents, such as relational databases and
human customer support. The code compliance copilot scans the internal DevOps
code to detect known and new compliance issues in pull requests (PR).

TL;DR: HRM-Agent是HRM的强化学习变体，能够在动态不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标，并成功重用先前时间步的计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HRM虽然在小规模下具有出色的推理能力，但仅适用于静态、完全可观测的监督问题，无法处理动态、不确定或部分可观测的现实世界问题。

Method: 开发HRM-Agent，这是HRM的变体，仅使用强化学习进行训练，探索其循环推理过程的动态特性。

Result: HRM-Agent能够在动态不确定的迷宫环境中学习导航到目标，其循环推理过程成功重用了先前时间步的计算。

Conclusion: HRM可以通过强化学习扩展到动态不确定环境，其推理能力源于循环推理过程对先前计算的重用。

Abstract: The Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) has impressive reasoning abilities
given its small size, but has only been applied to supervised, static,
fully-observable problems. One of HRM's strengths is its ability to adapt its
computational effort to the difficulty of the problem. However, in its current
form it cannot integrate and reuse computation from previous time-steps if the
problem is dynamic, uncertain or partially observable, or be applied where the
correct action is undefined, characteristics of many real-world problems.
  This paper presents HRM-Agent, a variant of HRM trained using only
reinforcement learning. We show that HRM can learn to navigate to goals in
dynamic and uncertain maze environments. Recent work suggests that HRM's
reasoning abilities stem from its recurrent inference process. We explore the
dynamics of the recurrent inference process and find evidence that it is
successfully reusing computation from earlier environment time-steps.

Motivation: 人类在熟练任务后认知负担会降低，而传统强化学习智能体在提升性能时计算效率并未改善。如果智能体能在学习过程中考虑计算成本，可能实现更节能的智能体并释放计算资源用于其他过程。

Method: 在Arcade Learning Environment中进行实验，向智能体展示计算成本，并赋予它们控制计算使用的自主权。

Result: 在相同训练计算预算下，考虑计算成本的智能体在75%的游戏中表现更好，平均减少三倍计算量。

Conclusion: 让强化学习智能体在训练过程中考虑计算成本可以显著提高计算效率，在保持性能的同时大幅减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning agents can achieve superhuman performance in
many complex tasks, they typically do not become more computationally efficient
as they improve. In contrast, humans gradually require less cognitive effort as
they become more proficient at a task. If agents could reason about their
compute as they learn, could they similarly reduce their computation footprint?
If they could, we could have more energy efficient agents or free up compute
cycles for other processes like planning. In this paper, we experiment with
showing agents the cost of their computation and giving them the ability to
control when they use compute. We conduct our experiments on the Arcade
Learning Environment, and our results demonstrate that with the same training
compute budget, agents that reason about their compute perform better on 75% of
games. Furthermore, these agents use three times less compute on average. We
analyze individual games and show where agents gain these efficiencies.

Result: 研究发现现有训练方法会放大模态差距，通过提出的策略可以有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 研究为开发能够减轻模态差距、促进更平衡多模态推理的训练方法提供了见解。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities on vision-and-language tasks. However, recent findings reveal an
imbalance in their reasoning capabilities across visual and textual modalities.
Specifically, current MLLMs often over-rely on textual cues while
under-attending to visual content, resulting in suboptimal performance on tasks
that require genuine visual reasoning. We refer to this phenomenon as the
\textit{modality gap}, defined as the performance disparity between
text-centric and vision-centric inputs. In this paper, we analyze the modality
gap through the lens of training recipes. We first show that existing training
recipes tend to amplify this gap. Then, we systematically explore strategies to
bridge it from two complementary perspectives: data and loss design. Our
findings provide insights into developing training recipes that mitigate the
modality gap and promote more balanced multimodal reasoning. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/UCSB-NLP-Chang/Bridging-Modality-Gap.

Abstract: Cognitive studies and artificial intelligence have developed distinct models
for various inferential mechanisms (categorization, induction, abduction,
causal inference, contrast, merge, ...). Yet, both natural and artificial views
on cognition lack apparently a unifying framework. This paper formulates a
speculative answer attempting to respond to this gap. To postulate on
higher-level activation processes from a material perspective, we consider
inferential mechanisms informed by symbolic AI modelling techniques, through
the simplistic lenses of electronic circuits based on logic gates. We observe
that a logic gate view entails a different treatment of implication and
negation compared to standard logic and logic programming. Then, by
combinatorial exploration, we identify four main forms of dependencies that can
be realized by these inferential circuits. Looking at how these forms are
generally used in the context of logic programs, we identify eight common
inferential patterns, exposing traditionally distinct inferential mechanisms in
an unifying framework. Finally, following a probabilistic interpretation of
logic programs, we unveil inner functional dependencies. The paper concludes
elaborating in what sense, even if our arguments are mostly informed by
symbolic means and digital systems infrastructures, our observations may
pinpoint to more generally applicable structures.

Conclusion: CoreThink框架有效解决了工具调用环境中的泛化问题，展示了符号推理层在提升LLM跨领域工具协调能力方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Generalization across Agentic tool-calling environments remains a key
unsolved challenge in developing reliable agentic reasoning systems. While
large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on isolated
benchmarks, their ability to transfer reasoning strategies and co-ordinate
tools across diverse domains is poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a
large-scale evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on multiple tool-calling
benchmarksBFCL v3, TauBench, Tau2Bench, and AceBenchand introduce MAVEN (Math &
Physics Adversarial Verification & Evaluation Network), a new out of
distribution (OOD) benchmark designed to stress-test multi-step reasoning
through explicit verification and adversarial task composition. Our results
show that most current models achieve below 50% accuracy on MAVEN, revealing a
significant generalization gap across tool-use settings.
  To address this, we present the CoreThink Agentic Reasoner, a framework that
augments LLMs with a lightweight symbolic reasoning layer for structured
decomposition and adaptive tool orchestration. Without additional training, it
generalizes across all benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
530% improvements over existing baselines at roughly one-tenth the
computational cost.

Conclusion: GTR-Mamba通过跨流形条件路由成功解决了同时建模空间层次结构和时间动态性的挑战，为POI推荐提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation is a critical task in modern
Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs), aiming to model the complex
decision-making process of human mobility to provide personalized
recommendations for a user's next check-in location. Existing POI
recommendation models, predominantly based on Graph Neural Networks and
sequential models, have been extensively studied. However, these models face a
fundamental limitation: they struggle to simultaneously capture the inherent
hierarchical structure of spatial choices and the dynamics and irregular shifts
of user-specific temporal contexts. To overcome this limitation, we propose
GTR-Mamba, a novel framework for cross-manifold conditioning and routing.
GTR-Mamba leverages the distinct advantages of different mathematical spaces
for different tasks: it models the static, tree-like preference hierarchies in
hyperbolic geometry, while routing the dynamic sequence updates to a novel
Mamba layer in the computationally stable and efficient Euclidean tangent
space. This process is coordinated by a cross-manifold channel that fuses
spatio-temporal information to explicitly steer the State Space Model (SSM),
enabling flexible adaptation to contextual changes. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR-Mamba consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baseline models in next POI recommendation.

Result: 在平均奖励和QoS指标上持续优于现有MARL基线方法，展示了可扩展性和实际应用价值

Conclusion: MA-CDMP通过扩散模型和均值场机制有效解决了分布式无线通信资源管理的挑战，具有理论保证和实际性能优势

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, efficient and adaptive resource allocation
plays a crucial role in enhancing overall Quality of Service (QoS). While
centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) frameworks rely on a
central coordinator for policy training and resource scheduling, they suffer
from scalability issues and privacy risks. In contrast, the Distributed
Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) paradigm enables distributed
learning and decision-making, but it struggles with non-stationarity and
limited inter-agent cooperation, which can severely degrade system performance.
To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion
Model Planner (MA-CDMP) for decentralized communication resource management.
Built upon the Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) paradigm, MA-CDMP
employs Diffusion Models (DMs) to capture environment dynamics and plan future
trajectories, while an inverse dynamics model guides action generation, thereby
alleviating the sample inefficiency and slow convergence of conventional DTDE
methods. Moreover, to approximate large-scale agent interactions, a Mean-Field
(MF) mechanism is introduced as an assistance to the classifier in DMs. This
design mitigates inter-agent non-stationarity and enhances cooperation with
minimal communication overhead in distributed settings. We further
theoretically establish an upper bound on the distributional approximation

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过系统性减少指令不确定性，显著提升了语义约束对抗样本的生成质量，为未来研究提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

Motivation: 开发一个能够为不同类型用户提供高效且可信赖解释的通用框架，解决现有解释方法在用户适配性和解释质量方面的局限性。

Method: ProfileXAI框架耦合后置解释器（SHAP、LIME、Anchor）与检索增强的LLMs，索引多模态知识库，基于定量标准选择解释器，使用聊天式提示生成接地叙述。

Result: 在心脏病和甲状腺癌数据集上的评估显示：LIME在保真度-鲁棒性权衡上表现最佳；Anchor产生最稀疏、低token的规则；SHAP获得最高满意度。Profile条件化稳定token使用并保持各用户配置的正面评分。

Conclusion: ProfileXAI能够实现高效且可信赖的解释，没有单一解释器在所有指标上占优，但通过框架集成可以满足不同用户需求，特别是在稳定token使用和维持正面用户评价方面表现良好。

Abstract: ProfileXAI is a model- and domain-agnostic framework that couples post-hoc
explainers (SHAP, LIME, Anchor) with retrieval - augmented LLMs to produce
explanations for different types of users. The system indexes a multimodal
knowledge base, selects an explainer per instance via quantitative criteria,
and generates grounded narratives with chat-enabled prompting. On Heart Disease
and Thyroid Cancer datasets, we evaluate fidelity, robustness, parsimony, token
use, and perceived quality. No explainer dominates: LIME achieves the best
fidelity--robustness trade-off (Infidelity $\le 0.30$, $L<0.7$ on Heart
Disease); Anchor yields the sparsest, low-token rules; SHAP attains the highest
satisfaction ($\bar{x}=4.1$). Profile conditioning stabilizes tokens ($\sigma
\le 13\%$) and maintains positive ratings across profiles ($\bar{x}\ge 3.7$,
with domain experts at $3.77$), enabling efficient and trustworthy
explanations.

Conclusion: 通过可调节的混合密度规划策略，MDD能够更好地平衡长期依赖捕获和规划性能，验证了非均匀时间密度假设的有效性

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that diffusion planners benefit from sparse-step
planning over single-step planning. Training models to skip steps in their
trajectories helps capture long-term dependencies without additional or memory
computational cost. However, predicting excessively sparse plans degrades
performance. We hypothesize this temporal density threshold is non-uniform
across a temporal horizon and that certain parts of a planned trajectory should
be more densely planned. We propose Mixed Density Diffuser (MDD), a diffusion
planner where the densities throughout the horizon are tunable hyperparameters.
MDD achieves a new SOTA across the Maze2D, Franka Kitchen, and Antmaze D4RL
task domains.

This emerging paradigm, the AI scientist, is architected to emulate the
complete scientific workflow-from initial hypothesis generation to the final
synthesis of publishable findings-thereby promising to fundamentally reshape
the pace and scale of discovery. However, the rapid and unstructured
proliferation of these systems has created a fragmented research landscape,

Abstract: Driven by the dual principles of smart education and artificial intelligence
technology, the online education model has rapidly emerged as an important
component of the education industry. Cognitive diagnostic technology can
utilize students' learning data and feedback information in educational
evaluation to accurately assess their ability level at the knowledge level.
However, while massive amounts of information provide abundant data resources,
they also bring about complexity in feature extraction and scarcity of
disciplinary data. In cross-disciplinary fields, traditional cognitive
diagnostic methods still face many challenges. Given the differences in
knowledge systems, cognitive structures, and data characteristics between
different disciplines, this paper conducts in-depth research on neural network
cognitive diagnosis and knowledge association neural network cognitive
diagnosis, and proposes an innovative cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis
method (TLCD). This method combines deep learning techniques and transfer
learning strategies to enhance the performance of the model in the target
discipline by utilizing the common features of the main discipline. The
experimental results show that the cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis model
based on deep learning performs better than the basic model in
cross-disciplinary cognitive diagnosis tasks, and can more accurately evaluate
students' learning situation.

Method: 构建基于APPS编程挑战基准的代码样本数据集，训练带有回归层的价值头模型来估计中间输出的成功概率，结合过程奖励和结果奖励的考量。

Result: 小型LLM能够作为有效的奖励模型或代码评估评判器，成功识别多个候选方案中的正确解决方案。使用该评判器，在多个生成代码中搜索最准确代码的能力提升了超过20%。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型可以被转化为有效的奖励模型，用于代码生成质量的评估，显著提升代码搜索和选择能力，为代码生成模型的演进提供了实用的中间工具。

Abstract: Generating high-quality code remains a challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs). For the evolution of reasoning models on this task, reward models are a
necessary intermediate step. These models judge outcomes or intermediate steps.
Decoder-only transformer models can be turned into reward models by introducing
a regression layer and supervised fine-tuning. While it is known that
reflection capabilities generally increase with the size of a model, we want to
investigate whether state-of-the-art small language models like the Phi-4
family can be turned into usable reward models blending the consideration of
process rewards and outcome rewards.
  Targeting this goal, we construct a dataset of code samples with correctness
labels derived from the APPS coding challenge benchmark. We then train a
value-head model to estimate the success probability of intermediate outputs.
Our evaluation shows that small LLMs are capable of serving as effective reward
models or code evaluation critics, successfully identifying correct solutions
among multiple candidates. Using this critic, we achieve over a 20% improvement
in the search capability of the most accurate code out of multiple generations.

Motivation: 解决科学大语言模型在处理原始生物分子序列时面临的tokenization困境，探索更有效的输入策略。

Method: 系统比较领先的科学大语言模型在生物推理任务上的三种输入模式：仅序列、仅上下文、序列与上下文结合。

Result: 仅上下文方法始终显著优于其他模式，原始序列的加入反而会降低性能，表明原始序列对模型来说是信息噪声。

Conclusion: 科学大语言模型的主要优势在于对结构化知识的推理能力，而非直接解释生物分子语法，应将其重新定位为基于专家知识的推理引擎。

Abstract: Scientific Large Language Models (Sci-LLMs) have emerged as a promising
frontier for accelerating biological discovery. However, these models face a
fundamental challenge when processing raw biomolecular sequences: the
tokenization dilemma. Whether treating sequences as a specialized language,
risking the loss of functional motif information, or as a separate modality,
introducing formidable alignment challenges, current strategies fundamentally
limit their reasoning capacity. We challenge this sequence-centric paradigm by
positing that a more effective strategy is to provide Sci-LLMs with high-level
structured context derived from established bioinformatics tools, thereby
bypassing the need to interpret low-level noisy sequence data directly. Through
a systematic comparison of leading Sci-LLMs on biological reasoning tasks, we
tested three input modes: sequence-only, context-only, and a combination of
both. Our findings are striking: the context-only approach consistently and
substantially outperforms all other modes. Even more revealing, the inclusion
of the raw sequence alongside its high-level context consistently degrades
performance, indicating that raw sequences act as informational noise, even for
models with specialized tokenization schemes. These results suggest that the
primary strength of existing Sci-LLMs lies not in their nascent ability to
interpret biomolecular syntax from scratch, but in their profound capacity for
reasoning over structured, human-readable knowledge. Therefore, we argue for
reframing Sci-LLMs not as sequence decoders, but as powerful reasoning engines
over expert knowledge. This work lays the foundation for a new class of hybrid
scientific AI agents, repositioning the developmental focus from direct
sequence interpretation towards high-level knowledge synthesis. The code is

Result: FoG成功消除了翻转、滚动等不良行为，避免了危险区域，在状态和像素任务中都有效

Conclusion: FoG能够发现难以明确定义的行为技能，将人类意图有效融入技能发现过程

Abstract: Learning diverse skills without hand-crafted reward functions could
accelerate reinforcement learning in downstream tasks. However, existing skill
discovery methods focus solely on maximizing the diversity of skills without
considering human preferences, which leads to undesirable behaviors and
possibly dangerous skills. For instance, a cheetah robot trained using previous
methods learns to roll in all directions to maximize skill diversity, whereas
we would prefer it to run without flipping or entering hazardous areas. In this
work, we propose a Foundation model Guided (FoG) skill discovery method, which
incorporates human intentions into skill discovery through foundation models.
Specifically, FoG extracts a score function from foundation models to evaluate
states based on human intentions, assigning higher values to desirable states
and lower to undesirable ones. These scores are then used to re-weight the
rewards of skill discovery algorithms. By optimizing the re-weighted skill
discovery rewards, FoG successfully learns to eliminate undesirable behaviors,
such as flipping or rolling, and to avoid hazardous areas in both state-based
and pixel-based tasks. Interestingly, we show that FoG can discover skills
involving behaviors that are difficult to define. Interactive visualisations

TL;DR: AUPO是一种改进MCTS决策策略的自动动作抽象算法，仅依赖MCTS期间获得的奖励分布统计，无需转移概率或DAG搜索图，能检测对称动作，在IPPC基准问题上明显优于MCTS。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进MCTS决策策略，开发无需转移概率和DAG搜索图的自动动作抽象方法，解决现有框架如ASAP在检测对称动作时的局限性。

Method: 提出AUPO算法，作为MCTS的即插即用修改，仅基于MCTS过程中收集的奖励分布统计构建动作抽象，不影响树搜索本身。

Result: 在IPPC基准问题上的比较显示，AUPO明显优于标准MCTS，能有效检测对称动作，而ASAP等现有框架在对称状态相距较远时难以处理。

Conclusion: AUPO是一种有效的MCTS改进方法，仅影响决策策略，可与其他仅影响树搜索的抽象技术兼容，提供更好的性能表现。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, drop-in modification to Monte Carlo Tree Search's
(MCTS) decision policy that we call AUPO. Comparisons based on a range of IPPC
benchmark problems show that AUPO clearly outperforms MCTS. AUPO is an
automatic action abstraction algorithm that solely relies on reward
distribution statistics acquired during the MCTS. Thus, unlike other automatic
abstraction algorithms, AUPO requires neither access to transition
probabilities nor does AUPO require a directed acyclic search graph to build
its abstraction, allowing AUPO to detect symmetric actions that
state-of-the-art frameworks like ASAP struggle with when the resulting
symmetric states are far apart in state space. Furthermore, as AUPO only
affects the decision policy, it is not mutually exclusive with other
abstraction techniques that only affect the tree search.

Abstract: While several high profile video games have served as testbeds for Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL), this technique has rarely been employed by the
game industry for crafting authentic AI behaviors. Previous research focuses on
training super-human agents with large models, which is impractical for game
studios with limited resources aiming for human-like agents. This paper
proposes a sample-efficient DRL method tailored for training and fine-tuning
agents in industrial settings such as the video game industry. Our method
improves sample efficiency of value-based DRL by leveraging pre-collected data
and increasing network plasticity. We evaluate our method training a goalkeeper
agent in EA SPORTS FC 25, one of the best-selling football simulations today.
Our agent outperforms the game's built-in AI by 10% in ball saving rate.
Ablation studies show that our method trains agents 50% faster compared to
standard DRL methods. Finally, qualitative evaluation from domain experts
indicates that our approach creates more human-like gameplay compared to
hand-crafted agents. As a testimony of the impact of the approach, the method
is intended to replace the hand-crafted counterpart in next iterations of the
series.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法（如神经算子）需要大量高保真训练数据，导致显著的计算成本。为了解决这一挑战，需要开发能同时加速数据生成并提高精度的算法。

Method: BlocKOA算法首先基于热方程结构使用块Krylov算法快速获得少量基本解，然后组合这些解得到满足物理约束的多个温度分布，最后应用热算子确定热源分布，从而高效生成精确数据点。

Result: 理论分析显示BlocKOA的时间复杂度比现有方法低一个数量级。实验结果表明，在生成5000个具有不同物理参数和IC结构芯片的热仿真数据时，BlocKOA实现了420倍的加速。即使只使用4%的生成时间，基于BlocKOA生成数据训练的数据驱动方法性能与使用现有方法相当。

Conclusion: BlocKOA是一种高效且精确的IC热仿真数据生成算法，显著降低了数据生成的计算成本，同时保持了数据驱动方法的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven approaches, such as neural operators (NOs),
have shown substantial efficacy in reducing the solution time for integrated
circuit (IC) thermal simulations. However, a limitation of these approaches is
requiring a large amount of high-fidelity training data, such as chip
parameters and temperature distributions, thereby incurring significant
computational costs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm
for the generation of IC thermal simulation data, named block Krylov and
operator action (BlocKOA), which simultaneously accelerates the data generation
process and enhances the precision of generated data. BlocKOA is specifically
designed for IC applications. Initially, we use the block Krylov algorithm
based on the structure of the heat equation to quickly obtain a few basic
solutions. Then we combine them to get numerous temperature distributions that
satisfy the physical constraints. Finally, we apply heat operators on these
functions to determine the heat source distributions, efficiently generating
precise data points. Theoretical analysis shows that the time complexity of
BlocKOA is one order lower than the existing method. Experimental results
further validate its efficiency, showing that BlocKOA achieves a 420-fold
speedup in generating thermal simulation data for 5000 chips with varying
physical parameters and IC structures. Even with just 4% of the generation
time, data-driven approaches trained on the data generated by BlocKOA exhibits
comparable performance to that using the existing method.

Conclusion: 强化学习方法在CNOT门最小化问题上显示出潜力，特别是在处理较大尺寸电路时表现优异。

Abstract: CNOT gates are fundamental to quantum computing, as they facilitate
entanglement, a crucial resource for quantum algorithms. Certain classes of
quantum circuits are constructed exclusively from CNOT gates. Given their
widespread use, it is imperative to minimise the number of CNOT gates employed.
This problem, known as CNOT minimisation, remains an open challenge, with its
computational complexity yet to be fully characterised. In this work, we
introduce a novel reinforcement learning approach to address this task. Instead
of training multiple reinforcement learning agents for different circuit sizes,
we use a single agent up to a fixed size $m$. Matrices of sizes different from
m are preprocessed using either embedding or Gaussian striping. To assess the
efficacy of our approach, we trained an agent with m = 8, and evaluated it on
matrices of size n that range from 3 to 15. The results we obtained show that
our method overperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm as the value of n
increases.

Motivation: 在快速变化的动态环境中，确保人类对关键任务要素保持准确理解至关重要。辅助智能体需要识别最高优先级信息，并估计如何以及何时最有效地传递这些信息，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Method: 使用模糊逻辑推理从语句中进行更深层次的细粒度意见挖掘，然后基于这些信息对实体进行排名

Result: 该方法能够实现细粒度的意见分类和实体排名

Conclusion: 提出的基于模糊逻辑的细粒度意见挖掘方法为实体排名提供了新的技术途径

Abstract: Opinions are central to almost all human activities and are key influencers
of our behaviors. In current times due to growth of social networking website
and increase in number of e-commerce site huge amount of opinions are now
available on web. Given a set of evaluative statements that contain opinions
(or sentiments) about an Entity, opinion mining aims to extract attributes and
components of the object that have been commented on in each statement and to
determine whether the comments are positive, negative or neutral. While lot of
research recently has been done in field of opinion mining and some of it
dealing with ranking of entities based on review or opinion set, classifying
opinions into finer granularity level and then ranking entities has never been
done before. In this paper method for opinion mining from statements at a
deeper level of granularity is proposed. This is done by using fuzzy logic
reasoning, after which entities are ranked as per this information.

Motivation: 流处理管道对于实时数据处理至关重要，但传统方法在高层用户意图与平台特定实现之间存在语义鸿沟，开发过程耗时且容易出错。

Method: 集成超图思维(HGoT)作为GoT的扩展版本，结合弹性执行策略和高级查询分析，实现跨分布式流处理系统的结构化多智能体推理。

Result: 实验评估显示，相比LLM代码生成方法，AutoStreamPipe显著减少开发时间(6.3倍)和错误率(5.19倍)，通过新颖的错误自由分数(EFS)衡量。

Conclusion: AutoStreamPipe框架有效解决了流处理管道自动化的挑战，为实时数据处理提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Data pipelines are essential in stream processing as they enable the
efficient collection, processing, and delivery of real-time data, supporting
rapid data analysis. In this paper, we present AutoStreamPipe, a novel
framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the design,
generation, and deployment of stream processing pipelines. AutoStreamPipe
bridges the semantic gap between high-level user intent and platform-specific
implementations across distributed stream processing systems for structured
multi-agent reasoning by integrating a Hypergraph of Thoughts (HGoT) as an
extended version of GoT. AutoStreamPipe combines resilient execution
strategies, advanced query analysis, and HGoT to deliver pipelines with good
accuracy. Experimental evaluations on diverse pipelines demonstrate that
AutoStreamPipe significantly reduces development time (x6.3) and error rates
(x5.19), as measured by a novel Error-Free Score (EFS), compared to LLM
code-generation methods.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Bid2X竞价基础模型，通过统一函数学习不同场景下的竞价效果预测，解决了传统模型跨场景泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动竞价模型通常针对特定场景设计，缺乏跨环境的泛化能力。需要一种能够学习场景无关竞价原则的统一模型。

Method: 使用统一序列嵌入编码异构数据，提出两种注意力机制分别处理变量间和时序依赖关系，采用变量感知融合模块进行预测，并使用零膨胀投影模块处理竞价数据分布特性。

Result: 在8个数据集上离线评估显示Bid2X优于各种基线方法，在线A/B测试中GMV提升4.65%，ROI提升2.44%。

Conclusion: Bid2X证明了竞价基础模型在计算广告中的可行性，为跨场景竞价建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is crucial in facilitating online advertising by automatically
providing bids for advertisers. While previous work has made great efforts to
model bidding environments for better ad performance, it has limitations in
generalizability across environments since these models are typically tailored
for specific bidding scenarios. To this end, we approach the
scenario-independent principles through a unified function that estimates the
achieved effect under specific bids, such as budget consumption, gross
merchandise volume (GMV), page views, etc. Then, we propose a bidding
foundation model Bid2X to learn this fundamental function from data in various
scenarios. Our Bid2X is built over uniform series embeddings that encode
heterogeneous data through tailored embedding methods. To capture complex
inter-variable and dynamic temporal dependencies in bidding data, we propose
two attention mechanisms separately treating embeddings of different variables
and embeddings at different times as attention tokens for representation
learning. On top of the learned variable and temporal representations, a
variable-aware fusion module is used to perform adaptive bidding outcome
prediction. To model the unique bidding data distribution, we devise a
zero-inflated projection module to incorporate the estimated non-zero
probability into its value prediction, which makes up a joint optimization
objective containing classification and regression. The objective is proven to
converge to the zero-inflated distribution. Our model has been deployed on the
ad platform in Taobao, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms. Offline
evaluation on eight datasets exhibits Bid2X's superiority compared to various
baselines and its generality across different scenarios. Bid2X increased GMV by
4.65% and ROI by 2.44% in online A/B tests, paving the way for bidding
foundation model in computational advertising.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DQN依赖关联学习，容易获得虚假相关性，限制了其问题解决能力。需要引入因果推理来理解环境的因果结构。

Result: 在标准基准环境上的实验表明，该方法优于传统DQN，显著提升了问题解决能力且不损害性能。

Conclusion: 通过原则性因果推理为深度强化学习智能体能力提升提供了有前景的途径。

Abstract: Deep Q Networks (DQN) have shown remarkable success in various reinforcement
learning tasks. However, their reliance on associative learning often leads to
the acquisition of spurious correlations, hindering their problem-solving
capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to integrate causal
principles into DQNs, leveraging the PEACE (Probabilistic Easy vAriational
Causal Effect) formula for estimating causal effects. By incorporating causal
reasoning during training, our proposed framework enhances the DQN's
understanding of the underlying causal structure of the environment, thereby
mitigating the influence of confounding factors and spurious correlations. We
demonstrate that integrating DQNs with causal capabilities significantly
enhances their problem-solving capabilities without compromising performance.
Experimental results on standard benchmark environments showcase that our
approach outperforms conventional DQNs, highlighting the effectiveness of
causal reasoning in reinforcement learning. Overall, our work presents a
promising avenue for advancing the capabilities of deep reinforcement learning
agents through principled causal inference.

TL;DR: 本文是对Cappelen等人关于AI生存风险分类分析论文的评论，重点讨论了线性风险模型的哲学局限性，分析了瑞士奶酪模型的差异，并论证了在认知漠视情境下AI生存风险概率P(D)可能被低估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者旨在揭示AI生存风险评估中线性模型的局限性，强调需要考虑结构关系和不确定性维度，以更准确地理解AI生存风险的可能性。

Method: 通过比较标准瑞士奶酪模型与作者使用的模型，分析结构层间关系对风险概率的影响，并区分风险与不确定性，引入选项不确定性和状态空间不确定性两个维度。

Result: 论证表明在认知漠视情境下，AI生存风险概率P(D)可能高于初步估计，且风险评估受到两种不确定性维度的结构性影响。

Conclusion: 将不确定性维度纳入AI生存风险的定性讨论中，能够提供对P(D)可能性的更好理解，超越简单的线性风险评估模型。

Abstract: This work is a commentary of the article
\href{https://doi.org/10.18716/ojs/phai/2025.2801}{AI Survival Stories: a
Taxonomic Analysis of AI Existential Risk} by Cappelen, Goldstein, and
Hawthorne. It is not just a commentary though, but a useful reminder of the
philosophical limitations of \say{linear} models of risk. The article will
focus on the model employed by the authors: first, I discuss some differences
between standard Swiss Cheese models and this one. I then argue that in a
situation of epistemic indifference the probability of P(D) is higher than what
one might first suggest, given the structural relationships between layers. I
then distinguish between risk and uncertainty, and argue that any estimation of
P(D) is structurally affected by two kinds of uncertainty: option uncertainty
and state-space uncertainty. Incorporating these dimensions of uncertainty into
our qualitative discussion on AI existential risk can provide a better
understanding of the likeliness of P(D).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业需要满足最小权限、符合法规且可审计的访问决策，但传统方法难以有效解释自然语言请求与书面策略的关系。

Method: 使用Google Gemini 2.0 Flash实现六阶段推理框架：上下文解释、用户验证、数据分类、业务目的测试、合规映射和风险综合，采用早期硬策略门控和默认拒绝机制。

Result: 在14个标准案例评估中，精确决策匹配从10/14提升到13/14（92.9%），拒绝召回率达到1.00，必须拒绝场景的误批准率降为0，功能适当性和合规性均为14/14，专家评分高，中位延迟低于1分钟。

Conclusion: 策略约束的LLM推理结合显式门控和审计追踪，能够将人类可读策略转化为安全、合规且可追溯的机器决策。

Abstract: Enterprises need access decisions that satisfy least privilege, comply with
regulations, and remain auditable. We present a policy aware controller that
uses a large language model (LLM) to interpret natural language requests
against written policies and metadata, not raw data. The system, implemented
with Google Gemini~2.0 Flash, executes a six-stage reasoning framework (context
interpretation, user validation, data classification, business purpose test,
compliance mapping, and risk synthesis) with early hard policy gates and deny
by default. It returns APPROVE, DENY, CONDITIONAL together with cited controls
and a machine readable rationale. We evaluate on fourteen canonical cases
across seven scenario families using a privacy preserving benchmark. Results
show Exact Decision Match improving from 10/14 to 13/14 (92.9\%) after applying
policy gates, DENY recall rising to 1.00, False Approval Rate on must-deny
families dropping to 0, and Functional Appropriateness and Compliance Adherence
at 14/14. Expert ratings of rationale quality are high, and median latency is
under one minute. These findings indicate that policy constrained LLM
reasoning, combined with explicit gates and audit trails, can translate human
readable policies into safe, compliant, and traceable machine decisions.

Conclusion: 该框架为人类-AI协作决策提供了理论基础和实用算法，能够适应分布变化和人类行为演化，提升决策系统的可靠性。

Abstract: AI predictive systems are increasingly embedded in decision making pipelines,
shaping high stakes choices once made solely by humans. Yet robust decisions
under uncertainty still rely on capabilities that current AI lacks: domain
knowledge not captured by data, long horizon context, and reasoning grounded in
the physical world. This gap has motivated growing efforts to design
collaborative frameworks that combine the complementary strengths of humans and
AI. This work advances this vision by identifying the fundamental principles of
Human AI collaboration within uncertainty quantification, a key component of
reliable decision making. We introduce Human AI Collaborative Uncertainty
Quantification, a framework that formalizes how an AI model can refine a human
expert's proposed prediction set with two goals: avoiding counterfactual harm,
ensuring the AI does not degrade correct human judgments, and complementarity,
enabling recovery of correct outcomes the human missed. At the population
level, we show that the optimal collaborative prediction set follows an
intuitive two threshold structure over a single score function, extending a
classical result in conformal prediction. Building on this insight, we develop
practical offline and online calibration algorithms with provable distribution
free finite sample guarantees. The online method adapts to distribution shifts,
including human behavior evolving through interaction with AI, a phenomenon we
call Human to AI Adaptation. Experiments across image classification,
regression, and text based medical decision making show that collaborative
prediction sets consistently outperform either agent alone, achieving higher
coverage and smaller set sizes across various conditions.

Abstract: This paper establishes a formal equivalence between the architectural classes
of modern agentic AI systems and the abstract machines of the Chomsky
hierarchy. We posit that the memory architecture of an AI agent is the
definitive feature determining its computational power and that it directly
maps it to a corresponding class of automaton. Specifically, we demonstrate
that simple reflex agents are equivalent to Finite Automata, hierarchical
task-decomposition agents are equivalent to Pushdown Automata, and agents
employing readable/writable memory for reflection are equivalent to TMs. This
Automata-Agent Framework provides a principled methodology for right-sizing
agent architectures to optimize computational efficiency and cost. More
critically, it creates a direct pathway to formal verification, enables the
application of mature techniques from automata theory to guarantee agent safety
and predictability. By classifying agents, we can formally delineate the
boundary between verifiable systems and those whose behavior is fundamentally
undecidable. We address the inherent probabilistic nature of LLM-based agents
by extending the framework to probabilistic automata that allow quantitative
risk analysis. The paper concludes by outlining an agenda for developing static
analysis tools and grammars for agentic frameworks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的情感理性验证器（ERV）和解释奖励方法，用于提高多模态大语言模型在情感识别中预测与解释的一致性，无需修改模型架构或额外标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于MLLM的方法在生成情感解释时经常与目标标签不一致，甚至与自身预测的情感相矛盾，这种不一致性在交互式环境中会造成误解并削弱可靠性。

Method: 提出情感理性验证器（ERV）和解释奖励，引导模型在情感识别过程中生成与目标情感明确一致的推理，无需修改模型架构或额外的视频描述标注。

Result: 在MAFW和DFEW数据集上显著提高了解释-预测一致性和解释情感准确性，通过广泛实验和人工评估验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅增强了解释与预测之间的对齐，还使MLLM能够提供情感上连贯、可信赖的交互，是实现真正类人HCI系统的关键一步。

Abstract: The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into
more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift,
emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues
underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for
predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust.
However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that
diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own
predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for
misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address
this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and
an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is
explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion
recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional
paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves
faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on
the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human
evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between
explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally
coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like
HCI systems.

Conclusion: NoRA基准将推动神经网络在系统性关系推理领域的进一步发展，要求模型具备更强大的推理能力。

Abstract: Designing models that can learn to reason in a systematic way is an important
and long-standing challenge. In recent years, a wide range of solutions have
been proposed for the specific case of systematic relational reasoning,
including Neuro-Symbolic approaches, variants of the Transformer architecture,
and specialised Graph Neural Networks. However, existing benchmarks for
systematic relational reasoning focus on an overly simplified setting, based on
the assumption that reasoning can be reduced to composing relational paths. In
fact, this assumption is hard-baked into the architecture of several recent
models, leading to approaches that can perform well on existing benchmarks but
are difficult to generalise to other settings. To support further progress in
the field of systematic relational reasoning with neural networks, we introduce
NoRA, a new benchmark which adds several levels of difficulty and requires
models to go beyond path-based reasoning.

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Abstract: As human machine teaming becomes central to paradigms like Industry 5.0, a
critical need arises for machines to safely and effectively interpret complex

behavioral ontologies, which are not designed for real time, collaborative
interpretation. This paper addresses this gap by presenting OntoPret, an
ontology for the interpretation of human behavior. Grounded in cognitive
science and a modular engineering methodology, OntoPret provides a formal,

Motivation: 现实世界任务需要不同粒度的决策，人类能够利用统一的认知表示实现这一点，但现有基于LLM的智能体缺乏这种跨粒度操作能力，因为现有范式将高层次规划和低层次行动严格分离，限制了动态适应性和泛化能力。

Method: ReCode将规划和行动统一在单一代码表示中，将高层次计划视为抽象占位函数，然后递归地将其分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始行动，这种递归结构消除了计划和行动之间的严格边界。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线方法，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率，验证了通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有效方法。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的强大有效方法，递归结构还能生成丰富的多粒度训练数据，使模型能够学习分层决策过程。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

TL;DR: ChatGPT发布后，公众对AI的接受度下降，对人监督的需求增加，并扩大了教育、语言和性别方面的社会不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究公众对AI的态度变化，特别是在ChatGPT发布前后，以了解GenAI热潮对公众接受度的影响。

Method: 使用大规模两波调查（n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488），代表瑞士人口，比较ChatGPT发布前后的公众态度。

Result: GenAI热潮与公众对AI接受度显著降低相关，完全不可接受AI的比例从23%升至30%，支持纯人类决策的比例从18%升至26%。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了行业对公众AI部署准备度的假设，强调技术发展需与公众偏好保持一致的重要性。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies
has led many organizations to integrate AI into their products and services,
often without considering user preferences. Yet, public attitudes toward AI
use, especially in impactful decision-making scenarios, are underexplored.
Using a large-scale two-wave survey study (n_wave1=1514, n_wave2=1488)
representative of the Swiss population, we examine shifts in public attitudes
toward AI before and after the launch of ChatGPT. We find that the GenAI boom
is significantly associated with reduced public acceptance of AI (see Figure 1)
and increased demand for human oversight in various decision-making contexts.
The proportion of respondents finding AI "not acceptable at all" increased from
23% to 30%, while support for human-only decision-making rose from 18% to 26%.
These shifts have amplified existing social inequalities in terms of widened
educational, linguistic, and gender gaps post-boom. Our findings challenge
industry assumptions about public readiness for AI deployment and highlight the
critical importance of aligning technological development with evolving public
preferences.

TL;DR: 提出了MAE框架，通过多智能体自演化的方式增强LLM的推理能力，无需人工标注数据，在数学、推理和常识问答等任务上平均提升4.54%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法依赖人工标注数据和可验证奖励，限制了可扩展性和通用性。自博弈RL方法需要特定环境反馈，难以扩展到通用领域。

Method: 基于单一LLM实例化三个交互智能体（提议者、求解者、评判者），通过强化学习优化它们的行为。提议者生成问题，求解者尝试解答，评判者评估并共同演化。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct上的实验显示，在多个基准测试中平均提升4.54%。

Conclusion: MAE是一种可扩展、数据高效的方法，能够以最小的人类监督依赖增强LLM的通用推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated significant potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However,
the success of RL for LLMs heavily relies on human-curated datasets and
verifiable rewards, which limit their scalability and generality. Recent
Self-Play RL methods, inspired by the success of the paradigm in games and Go,
aim to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities without human-annotated data.
However, their methods primarily depend on a grounded environment for feedback
(e.g., a Python interpreter or a game engine); extending them to general
domains remains challenging. To address these challenges, we propose
Multi-Agent Evolve (MAE), a framework that enables LLMs to self-evolve in
solving diverse tasks, including mathematics, reasoning, and general knowledge
Q&A. The core design of MAE is based on a triplet of interacting agents
(Proposer, Solver, Judge) that are instantiated from a single LLM, and applies
reinforcement learning to optimize their behaviors. The Proposer generates
questions, the Solver attempts solutions, and the Judge evaluates both while
co-evolving. Experiments on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct demonstrate that MAE achieves
an average improvement of 4.54% on multiple benchmarks. These results highlight
MAE as a scalable, data-efficient method for enhancing the general reasoning
abilities of LLMs with minimal reliance on human-curated supervision.

TL;DR: ALITA-G是一个自我进化框架，通过生成、抽象和策划MCP工具，将通用代理转变为领域专家，在多个基准测试中实现最先进性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我进化代理主要局限于提示重写或失败重试，需要更系统的领域适应方法。

Method: 框架包含三个步骤：执行目标领域任务并合成候选MCP，抽象为参数化原语并整合到MCP Box，推理时通过检索增强的MCP选择和执行。

Result: 在GAIA验证集上达到83.03% pass@1和89.09% pass@3的新SOTA结果，同时平均每个示例的token减少约15%。

Conclusion: ALITA-G提供了从通用能力到可重用领域特定能力的系统路径，在复杂推理任务上同时提高准确性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to perform better when
scaffolded into agents with memory, tools, and feedback. Beyond this,
self-evolving agents have emerged, but current work largely limits adaptation
to prompt rewriting or failure retries. Therefore, we present ALITA-G, a
self-evolution framework that transforms a general-purpose agent into a domain
expert by systematically generating, abstracting, and curating Model Context
Protocol (MCP) tools. In this framework, a generalist agent executes a curated
suite of target-domain tasks and synthesizes candidate MCPs from successful
trajectories. These are then abstracted to parameterized primitives and
consolidated into an MCP Box. At inference time, ALITA-G performs
retrieval-augmented MCP selection with the help of each tool's descriptions and
use cases, before executing an agent equipped with the MCP Executor. Across
several benchmarks GAIA, PathVQA, and Humanity's Last Exam, ALITA-G attains
strong gains while reducing computation costs. On GAIA validation, it achieves
83.03% pass@1 and 89.09% pass@3, establishing a new state-of-the-art result
while reducing mean tokens per example by approximately 15% relative to a
strong baseline agent. ALITA-G thus provides a principled pathway from
generalist capability to reusable, domain-specific competence, improving both
accuracy and efficiency on complex reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出环境感知运动匹配系统，通过动态适应障碍物和其他智能体来实现实时全身角色动画，强调姿态与轨迹之间的双向关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统角色动画技术难以处理任意情境，现有方法在环境交互和群体行为动画方面存在挑战，且常将身体动画与轨迹规划分开处理导致不一致。

Method: 预处理阶段从运动捕捉数据库中提取形状、姿态和轨迹特征；运行时执行高效搜索，匹配用户输入和当前姿态，同时对动态环境中的碰撞进行惩罚。

Result: 该方法使角色能够自然地调整姿态和轨迹来导航拥挤场景。

Conclusion: 环境感知运动匹配系统解决了传统方法的局限性，实现了更自然的角色动画和群体行为。

Abstract: Interactive applications demand believable characters that respond naturally
to dynamic environments. Traditional character animation techniques often
struggle to handle arbitrary situations, leading to a growing trend of
dynamically selecting motion-captured animations based on predefined features.
While Motion Matching has proven effective for locomotion by aligning to target
trajectories, animating environment interactions and crowd behaviors remains
challenging due to the need to consider surrounding elements. Existing
approaches often involve manual setup or lack the naturalism of motion capture.
Furthermore, in crowd animation, body animation is frequently treated as a
separate process from trajectory planning, leading to inconsistencies between
body pose and root motion. To address these limitations, we present
Environment-aware Motion Matching, a novel real-time system for full-body
character animation that dynamically adapts to obstacles and other agents,
emphasizing the bidirectional relationship between pose and trajectory. In a
preprocessing step, we extract shape, pose, and trajectory features from a
motion capture database. At runtime, we perform an efficient search that
matches user input and current pose while penalizing collisions with a dynamic
environment. Our method allows characters to naturally adjust their pose and
trajectory to navigate crowded scenes.

TL;DR: Step2Motion是首个从多模态鞋垫传感器重建人类运动的方法，利用压力和惯性数据来重建各种运动风格的人类运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类运动本质上由与环境的连续物理交互驱动，鞋垫传感器在无约束运动捕捉方面具有优势，但目前尚未被充分利用于运动重建方法中。

Method: 利用鞋垫传感器采集的压力和惯性数据（加速度和角速度）来重建人类运动。

Result: 该方法在多种运动风格下都表现出有效性，包括行走、慢跑、侧向移动、踮脚行走、轻微蹲姿和跳舞等。

Conclusion: Step2Motion填补了利用鞋垫传感器进行运动重建的研究空白，为户外环境中的无约束运动捕捉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion is fundamentally driven by continuous physical interaction with
the environment. Whether walking, running, or simply standing, the forces
exchanged between our feet and the ground provide crucial insights for
understanding and reconstructing human movement. Recent advances in wearable
insole devices offer a compelling solution for capturing these forces in
diverse, real-world scenarios. Sensor insoles pose no constraint on the users'
motion (unlike mocap suits) and are unaffected by line-of-sight limitations (in
contrast to optical systems). These qualities make sensor insoles an ideal
choice for robust, unconstrained motion capture, particularly in outdoor
environments. Surprisingly, leveraging these devices with recent motion
reconstruction methods remains largely unexplored. Aiming to fill this gap, we
present Step2Motion, the first approach to reconstruct human locomotion from
multi-modal insole sensors. Our method utilizes pressure and inertial
data-accelerations and angular rates-captured by the insoles to reconstruct
human motion. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of
experiments to show its versatility for diverse locomotion styles, from simple
ones like walking or jogging up to moving sideways, on tiptoes, slightly
crouching, or dancing.

TL;DR: FlowCapX是一个物理增强框架，用于从稀疏视频输入重建流体流动，通过分层优化策略解决长期物理约束与稀疏观测数据的联合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在保持物理一致性的同时捕捉湍流运动，限制了重建质量和下游任务性能。需要解决稀疏视图模糊性和长期物理约束的挑战。

Method: 采用混合框架，在粗粒度层面通过新颖的优化策略解决稀疏视图模糊性，强调基于涡度的物理约束；在细粒度层面优先保持观测保真度以保留湍流结构。

Result: 实验表明实现了最先进的流速重建，支持流速感知的下游任务，如精确的流动分析、场景增强和重模拟。

Conclusion: FlowCapX通过分层优化策略有效平衡了物理约束和观测保真度，显著提升了稀疏视频输入的流体重建质量。

Abstract: We present FlowCapX, a physics-enhanced framework for flow reconstruction
from sparse video inputs, addressing the challenge of jointly optimizing
complex physical constraints and sparse observational data over long time
horizons. Existing methods often struggle to capture turbulent motion while
maintaining physical consistency, limiting reconstruction quality and
downstream tasks. Focusing on velocity inference, our approach introduces a
hybrid framework that strategically separates representation and supervision
across spatial scales. At the coarse level, we resolve sparse-view ambiguities
via a novel optimization strategy that aligns long-term observation with
physics-grounded velocity fields. By emphasizing vorticity-based physical
constraints, our method enhances physical fidelity and improves optimization
stability. At the fine level, we prioritize observational fidelity to preserve
critical turbulent structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art velocity reconstruction, enabling velocity-aware downstream
tasks, e.g., accurate flow analysis, scene augmentation with tracer
visualization and re-simulation.
