*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的新方法，通过扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，并添加LiDAR支持，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）存在渲染速度慢、仅支持针孔相机模型的问题，且多传感器模拟存在跨传感器不一致性，限制了在自动驾驶测试中的应用。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计了分解的3D高斯表示和锚定策略来解决跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差平均降低40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了自动驾驶测试中多传感器模拟的关键挑战，在速度和精度方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [3] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SurgFUTR方法，将手术未来预测重新定义为状态变化学习，通过师生架构和Action Dynamics模块实现跨手术程序的通用预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解当前事件而非预测未来，缺乏统一的短期和长期预测方法，且现有方法难以泛化到不同手术场景。

Method: 采用师生架构，通过Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频片段压缩为状态表示，教师网络学习当前和未来片段，学生网络仅从当前视频预测未来状态，并使用Action Dynamics模块进行指导。

Result: 在四个数据集和三种手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序转移验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SurgFUTR通过状态变化学习框架有效解决了手术未来预测问题，在多个任务上表现出色且具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [4] [Automated document processing system for government agencies using DBNET++ and BART models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13303)
*Aya Kaysan Bahjat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于DBNet++和BART的文档分类系统，可处理图像中的文本内容并将其分类为发票、报告、信件和表格四类，支持离线图像和实时摄像头输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实际应用中因光照变化、任意方向、弯曲或部分遮挡文本、低分辨率等挑战导致的文档分类困难。

Method: 四阶段流水线：图像采集与预处理、使用DBNet++进行文本检测、使用BART进行文本分类、基于PyQt5的用户界面集成。

Result: 在Total-Text数据集上文本检测准确率达到92.88%，该系统在无约束成像场景下对混合来源文档分类有效。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法在实际应用中能够有效处理各种挑战性条件下的文档分类任务。

Abstract: An automatic document classification system is presented that detects textual
content in images and classifies documents into four predefined categories
(Invoice, Report, Letter, and Form). The system supports both offline images
(e.g., files on flash drives, HDDs, microSD) and real-time capture via
connected cameras, and is designed to mitigate practical challenges such as
variable illumination, arbitrary orientation, curved or partially occluded
text, low resolution, and distant text. The pipeline comprises four stages:
image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about
92.88% through 10 hours on Total-Text dataset that involve high resolution
images simulate a various and very difficult challenges. The results indicate
the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

### [5] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架解决植物病害诊断模型在目标域泛化能力差的问题，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，仅需少量目标域样本即可显著提升诊断鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外的图像上诊断准确率显著下降，主要由于疾病症状的细微变异性和领域差异，训练数据多样性不足导致模型在未见领域表现脆弱

Method: 提出目标感知度量学习与优先采样框架(TMPS)，基于度量学习，利用少量目标域标记样本，通过优先采样策略有效提升模型在目标域的适应能力

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升17.1个百分点

Conclusion: TMPS框架简单高效，通过少量目标域样本即可显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知领域的泛化能力和鲁棒性，为解决领域适应问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

### [6] [Leveraging 2D Priors and SDF Guidance for Dynamic Urban Scene Rendering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13381)
*Siddharth Tourani,Jayaram Reddy,Akash Kumbar,Satyajit Tourani,Nishant Goyal,Madhava Krishna,N. Dinesh Reddy,Muhammad Haris Khan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将符号距离函数(SDF)与3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)相结合的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据和真实3D运动标注即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的动态城市场景方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。本文探索是否可以通过2D对象无关先验(深度和点跟踪)结合SDF表示来放松这些要求。

Method: 将SDF与3DGS集成，利用两种方法的优势创建更鲁棒的对象表示。采用统一的优化框架，增强3D高斯泼溅的几何精度并改进SDF内的变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景中即使没有LiDAR数据也能在渲染指标上达到最先进性能。加入LiDAR后，在重建和生成不同对象类别的新视图方面进一步改进，无需真实3D运动标注。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现各种场景编辑任务，包括场景分解和场景组合，为动态场景渲染和重建提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉语言对齐增强框架，通过在训练中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，使现有视觉语言模型无需文本标签或完全重新训练就能生成改进的图像描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖标注图像数据集，限制了可扩展性并导致大量未标注图像数据未被充分利用。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐的零标签增强框架，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需人工或合成标注数据集。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上的应用显示，ViZer在定性评估中产生更接地气和描述性的图像描述，尽管自动评估指标如CIDEr和BERTScore可能惩罚参考描述中缺失的细节。

Conclusion: ViZer为零标签视觉语言任务提供了实用的起点，能够在不依赖文本标签的情况下持续改进现有模型的图像描述质量。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个专门针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过引入显著认知解耦方法，解决了胎儿超声中多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性的挑战，在报告生成和诊断方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的医疗视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，因为胎儿超声面临多视图图像推理、众多疾病和图像多样性的挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，并通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择，减少疾病变异性和视图异质性带来的学习瓶颈。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均增益达+14%，在关键病症上的准确率提高+61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过创新的SED方法和大规模数据集FetalSigma-1M，成功解决了胎儿超声领域的特殊挑战，为临床实践提供了可靠且高效的AI辅助工具。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [9] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级指导堆栈，包含ZeResFDG模块和QSilk微颗粒稳定器，无需重新训练即可提升图像清晰度、提示遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在采样过程中细节增强、提示遵循和伪影控制方面的不足，提供无需重新训练的高质量图像生成方案。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG结合频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影技术；轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中切换保守和细节寻求模式；QSilk稳定器通过分位数钳位和深度/边缘门控微细节注入提升稳定性。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器中，ZeResFDG在中等指导尺度下显著改善了图像锐度、提示遵循度和伪影控制；QSilk稳定器提高了鲁棒性并生成自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5为SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型提供了一套有效的采样器级指导方案，无需重新训练即可显著提升图像质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: SCOPE提出了一种混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择专用编码器，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器的VLMs存在计算成本高且收益递减的问题，需要更智能的编码器选择方法。

Method: 采用Mixture-of-Encoders框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池，通过轻量级路由器基于文本提示和视觉特征的交叉注意力动态选择最优编码器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享+1个路由编码器的SCOPE优于同时使用4个额外编码器的模型，计算量减少24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合方法，挑战了多编码器VLMs的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位(SVAG)新任务，要求模型基于自然语言描述同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中的所有相关对象。构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集，并提出SVAGFormer基线框架和SVAGEval评估工具包。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽视了根据动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并构建SVAG-Bench数据集(688个视频，19,590条标注记录，903个独特动词)。

Result: 实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中，突显了在长视频中对细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级推理的必要性。

Conclusion: SVAG任务对下一代AI系统至关重要，现有方法在该任务上的不足表明需要开发更先进的模型来处理细粒度对象-动作交互的时空推理。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

TL;DR: SeqBench是一个用于评估文本到视频生成中序列叙事连贯性的综合基准，包含320个提示的数据集和基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，揭示了当前T2V模型在多动作序列中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V生成模型在创建视觉吸引人的视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要多个事件逻辑推进的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，且现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标，缺乏对扩展序列叙事连贯性的评估。

Method: 提出了SeqBench基准，包含精心设计的320个提示数据集，涵盖各种叙事复杂性，以及基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，能够高效捕捉长距离依赖和时序排序。

Result: 基于DTG的指标与人类标注显示出强相关性。系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限性：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的物体状态、多物体场景中产生物理上不合理的结果、难以保持顺序动作之间的现实时序和排序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入到文本条件运动模型中，利用不相交的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么处理运动语义，要么处理场景感知，但无法同时兼顾，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集。第一阶段引入关键帧层来调制运动潜在空间进行中间帧生成，同时保持潜在流形；第二阶段添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入到文本到运动模型中，并进一步分析了这种感知出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，通过创新的两阶段适应方法实现了场景感知的文本到运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合框架1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba，用于心电图异常检测，在PhysioNet挑战赛上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提高心电图异常检测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

### [15] [True Self-Supervised Novel View Synthesis is Transferable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13063)
*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是首个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新颖视角合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了相机姿态与场景内容的解耦和姿态可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新颖视角合成方法的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性，即同一组姿态在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，这阻碍了真正的新颖视角合成能力。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视角几何概念，使用无约束的潜在姿态变量实现姿态与场景内容的解耦。

Result: XFactor在姿态可迁移性方面显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，潜在姿态与现实世界姿态高度相关，并提出了量化可迁移性的新指标。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何表示即可实现真正的新颖视角合成，为自监督3D场景理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

*Kaixuan Yang,Wei Xiang,Zhenshuai Chen,Tong Jin,Yunpeng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，通过分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量并保留其符号，改进了红外与可见光图像融合的边缘保真度和纹理保留效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的图像融合方法通常使用梯度幅度损失，但这种方法丢失了方向信息，导致模糊的监督和次优的边缘保真度。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留其符号，提供清晰的方向指导。

Result: 在开源模型和多个公共基准测试上的实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够产生更清晰、对齐更好的边缘和更丰富的纹理保留。

Conclusion: 所提出的方向感知多尺度梯度损失在不改变模型架构或训练协议的情况下，显著提升了红外与可见光图像融合的质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对医学图像分割中域偏移问题的无监督域适应框架，特别关注内容变化，通过风格归一化和双向可变形图像配准策略，在跨域海马体分割任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时，由于图像外观（风格）和解剖特征（内容）的域偏移而性能下降，特别是在从健康人群到痴呆患者的海马体分割任务中。

Method: 结合z-归一化进行高效风格协调，使用双向可变形图像配准策略，配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像到目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的全面评估显示，该方法在所有实验中均优于现有基线。从健康年轻人群到临床痴呆患者的转移中，Dice分数相对标准增强方法提升高达15%，在内容偏移显著的情况下效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效应对跨域海马体分割中的内容变化，在不同人群中实现准确的海马体分割。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种系统量化扩散概率模型中计数幻觉的方法，构建了CountHalluSet数据集套件，并开发了标准化评估协议来分析不同采样条件对计数幻觉的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散概率模型经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集套件，开发标准化评估协议，系统分析不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 发现FID等常用评估指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这项工作为系统量化扩散模型中的幻觉迈出了第一步，为研究图像生成中的幻觉现象提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest是一种轻量级的零样本视频编辑方法，通过时空特征记忆库减少计算开销，使用特征最相似传播保持时间一致性，并利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣对象掩码，实现高效准确的视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销大、内存消耗高的问题，且常常牺牲视觉保真度，导致时间不一致性和伪影（如模糊和马赛克）。

Method: 1. 时空特征记忆库(SFM)缓存空间注意力处理的关键图像标记；2. 特征最相似传播(FMP)将相关标记从前帧传播到后帧；3. SFM更新算法持续刷新缓存特征；4. 利用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣对象掩码。

Conclusion: 该方法通过轻量级设计显著降低了计算开销，同时保持了高质量的时间一致性和视觉保真度，为文本驱动的零样本视频编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

*Xijun Wang,Tanay Sharma,Achin Kulshrestha,Abhimitra Meka,Aveek Purohit,Dinesh Manocha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR场景中AI助手缺乏社交意识的问题，通过多模态上下文建模提升干预时机检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在AR/VR应用中缺乏社交意识，无法判断何时干预，导致频繁且不恰当的响应干扰自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的EgoSocial数据集，并提出EgoSoD方法，通过整合多模态上下文线索到社交思维图中动态建模参与者和交互。

Result: 实验显示现有OLLM在干预时机检测上表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD显著提升性能：干预时机检测提升Phi-4 45.6%、Gemini 2.5 Pro 9.9%；社交交互整体性能提升Phi-4 20.4%、Gemini 2.5 Pro 6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法通过多模态社交动态建模有效解决了AI助手在社交场景中的干预时机判断问题，显著优于现有模型。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类判断对齐的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: VPreg通过变分原理网格生成方法实现了优异的配准性能，在保持变换质量的同时提供了更准确的逆变换，为计算解剖学和形态计量学提供了可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强文本信息熵和超图适配器有效解决了跨模态语义对齐问题，显著提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习降噪模型大多在模拟或单一真实场景数据上训练，忽视了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 使用字典学习将TEM信号的固有物理特性（如指数衰减和平滑性）编码为字典驱动先验，在训练时集成到DTEMDNet网络中，测试时通过最小化基于字典一致性和信号一阶变化的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Conclusion: 提出的DP-TTA方法通过利用TEM信号的固有物理特性作为先验知识，有效提升了模型在不同地理环境下的适应能力和降噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注结构改进，而很少从表示融合的角度探索，导致2D图像中丰富的特征多样性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出CIGOcc两阶段占用预测框架，提取分割、图形和深度特征，引入可变形多级融合机制融合这三种多级特征，并整合SAM知识蒸馏。

Result: 在不增加训练成本的情况下，在SemanticKITTI基准上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CIGOcc通过多级表示融合有效提升了基于相机的3D占用预测性能，证明了特征融合策略的重要性。

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
SemanticKITTI benchmark. The code is provided in the supplementary material and
will be released https://github.com/VitaLemonTea1/CIGOcc

Conclusion: 通过提供这些资源，帮助社区跟踪变化、诊断问题，并为建立更稳健、透明和可靠的同行评审系统提供基于证据的改进建议。

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MimicParts框架，通过分区风格注入和分区去噪网络来生成更具表现力的3D人体运动，能够捕捉局部运动风格差异并根据语音节奏和情感动态调整运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从语音生成风格化3D人体运动时存在两个主要问题：一是风格编码过于简化或忽略区域运动风格差异；二是未能让运动风格动态适应语音节奏和情感变化。

Method: 将身体分为不同区域来编码局部运动风格，使用分区风格注入和分区去噪网络，通过分区注意力块让节奏和情感线索精确指导每个身体区域。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于现有方法，能够生成更自然和富有表现力的3D人体运动序列。

Conclusion: MimicParts框架通过分区方法有效解决了风格化3D人体运动生成中的精细风格捕捉和动态适应问题，显著提升了运动生成质量。

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Motivation: 当前研究中VP和VPT概念边界模糊，经常被互换使用，缺乏对这些技术及其应用的系统性区分。

Method: 从第一性原理重新审视VP和VPT设计，构建统一的提示式适应(PA)框架，提供基于可学习性、生成性和不可学习性的分类法，并按注入粒度组织。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门针对PA方法论和应用的全面调查，旨在为研究人员提供清晰的路线图来理解和探索PA相关研究的发展前景。

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临前景-背景极度不平衡、缺陷稀疏且尺度分布长尾、低对比度等问题，现有像素中心方法在像素重叠指标上表现良好，但在样本级决策稳定性不足，特别是对稀疏或细长缺陷。

Method: 基于共享编码器架构，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位。样本级监督调节特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升对小缺陷和低对比度缺陷的召回率，分割分支保留边界和形状细节以增强样本级决策稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心多任务学习框架和评估套件有效解决了工业缺陷检测中像素中心方法的局限性，通过决策关联指标更好地反映了实际质量控制需求。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

TL;DR: 该论文提出解决视觉语言模型在否定理解上的问题，通过CoVAND数据集和NegToMe模块来改进描述性物体检测任务中的否定理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在理解否定方面存在严重缺陷，即所谓的肯定偏见，这在描述性物体检测任务中尤为严重。

Method: 提出两个主要贡献：(1) CoVAND数据集，使用系统化的思维链和VQA流程生成高质量的实例接地否定数据；(2) NegToMe文本标记合并模块，通过将否定词与属性词合并为语义短语来解决标记化过程中的否定线索丢失问题，并结合参数高效的LoRA微调方法。

Result: 该方法显著提高了在挑战性否定基准测试上的性能，将错误阳性率降低，在OVDEval上NMS-AP提升高达+10.8分，并展示了对最先进视觉语言模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作在解决真实世界检测应用中的否定理解问题方面迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、多段线、线段），在单结构和多结构任务上都达到了最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: 将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过实例-几何交互实现了统一的多矢量类型提取，展示了在单一模型中处理复杂结构的有效性。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的广泛实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack展现出强大的适应性和优越性能，为多模态跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了前沿VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御策略有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLA模型的对抗脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击和防御策略为提升VLA模型在实际机器人应用中的安全性提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding

varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 所提出的网络实现了超实时的人群计数性能，在嵌入式系统上具有最快的推理速度，同时保持了有竞争力的准确率。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了VideoLLMs执行时间推理的机制，为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

### [40] [End-to-End Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13253)
*Chunhao Lu,Qiang Lu,Meichen Dong,Jake Luo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MDM是一种基于Mamba的多模态扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器实现多模态处理的统一，在图像生成和文本处理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息，实现编码和解码的统一。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

*Keyan Zhou,Zecheng Tang,Lingfeng Ming,Guanghao Zhou,Qiguang Chen,Dan Qiao,Zheming Yang,Libo Qin,Minghui Qiu,Juntao Li,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MMLongCite基准来评估大型视觉语言模型在长上下文场景中的忠实性，发现现有模型在处理长多模态上下文时存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型的上下文窗口不断扩展，但扩展的上下文窗口并不保证上下文的有效利用，这对实际应用构成关键挑战。目前的长上下文忠实性评估主要集中在纯文本领域，而多模态评估仍限于短上下文。

Method: 引入MMLongCite基准，包含8个不同任务，涵盖6个上下文长度区间，并整合了文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 对最先进的大型视觉语言模型的评估显示，它们在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实性有限。深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实性的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的方法来提升大型视觉语言模型在长多模态上下文中的忠实性，MMLongCite基准为此提供了评估基础。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

*JiaKui Hu,Zhengjian Yao,Lujia Jin,Yinghao Chen,Yanye Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过退化类型分类和图像重建实现通用图像恢复，在CNN和Transformer上显著提升性能，并发布UIR-2.5M数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中表现有限，需要一种能够处理多种退化类型且具有强泛化能力的预训练方法。

Method: 使用掩码退化分类预训练，包含编码器和两个解码器：分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器重构高质量图像，结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全合一恢复任务中PSNR至少提高3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别展现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT提供了一种有效的图像恢复预训练方法，显著提升各种网络架构的性能，并发布了大规模数据集支持后续研究。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at
https://github.com/MILab-PKU/MaskDCPT.

*Yang Li,Aming Wu,Zihao Zhang,Yahong Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于点云分割的新类发现方法(3D-NCD)，通过结构因果模型(SCM)学习基础类和新类之间的因果表示和推理关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云分割中新类发现问题，目标是利用已标注的基础类监督来分割未标注的新类。关键在于建立点表示与基础类标签之间的精确关联，以及基础类和新类点表示之间的表示关联。

Method: 使用结构因果模型(SCM)重新形式化3D-NCD问题，提出联合学习因果表示和推理的方法。包括分析基础类表示中的隐藏混杂因子，设计消除混杂因子的因果表示原型来捕获基础类的因果表示，然后使用图结构建模基础类因果表示原型与新类原型之间的因果关系。

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过引入因果关系作为强相关约束，能够揭示准确对应类别的本质点云表示，有效解决新类发现中的混淆问题。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM加速方法，在保持重建精度的同时实现了40倍的速度提升，能够处理大规模场景（如5000张图像）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在CPU上运行效率低下，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在处理大规模场景时GPU内存消耗急剧增加。需要一种既能保持精度又能高效处理大规模数据的SfM解决方案。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM流程的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA（束调整）和GP（全局定位）。

Result: 在不同规模的数据集上（包括5000张图像的大规模场景）进行实验，相比COLMAP实现了约40倍的加速，同时保持了相当甚至更好的重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，在保持重建质量的同时显著提升了SfM的处理效率，能够有效处理传统方法和深度学习方法难以应对的大规模场景。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的视觉语言模型解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少幻觉问题，显著提升事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用视觉增强，忽视了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询与视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个token候选大小，充分利用logit分布信息。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提出的解码方法相比最先进的解码方法显著增强了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询依赖的增强和熵感知解码对于改进LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Motivation: 日常生活中人们的注意力和兴趣受到视觉内容的高度影响，研究大型多模态模型是否能够捕捉视觉趣味性概念，以及其与人类评估的一致性。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o预测的一致性，利用模型对图像对的趣味性进行标注，并以此作为训练数据来蒸馏知识到学习排序模型中。

Result: 研究发现人类与GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分一致性，GPT-4o在捕捉该概念方面表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: 该研究为深入理解人类兴趣提供了途径，展示了大型多模态模型在视觉趣味性理解方面的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

### [47] [Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13317)
*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的代价体积，从而显著提高推理速度并减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于经验观察：一旦RAFT等光流估计器的其他网络部分得到充分训练，代价体积的重要性就会降低。代价体积的计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧的分辨率。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除代价体积。创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，同时比可比模型快1.2倍、内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能够在仅使用500MB GPU内存的情况下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 通过移除代价体积的训练策略，可以在保持高精度的同时显著提高光流估计的效率和实用性。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了Group-VQ方法，通过分组优化码本解决VQ-VAE中的码本崩溃问题，同时引入训练后码本重采样方法实现码本大小的灵活调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE存在码本崩溃问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，但限制了码本学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每个组独立优化，组内联合优化，同时提出训练后码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现更好，训练后码本采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本重采样提供了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渲染视频与相机拍摄视频存在显著差异，现有无参考视频质量评估方法主要针对相机视频，直接应用于渲染视频会产生偏差预测，因为渲染视频更容易出现时间伪影。

Method: 创建大型渲染导向视频数据集，包含多种3D场景和渲染设置，并标注主观质量分数；设计专门针对渲染视频的NR-VQA指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 提出的NR-VQA指标在渲染视频上表现优于现有方法，能够有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 渲染视频需要专门的评估方法，提出的数据集和指标为渲染视频质量评估提供了有效解决方案，并在实际应用中展现出良好性能。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究提示语设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿态）的影响，特别是在数据稀缺条件下的零样本分类。

Method: 使用现代VLM模型（OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2、SigLip），在285张COCO数据集图像上评估三层次提示语设计，系统增加语言细节。

Result: 高性能模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP）使用最简单提示语效果最佳，增加细节显著降低性能（准确率从68.8%降至55.1%）；低性能模型SigLip在模糊类别上使用详细提示语表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示语设计对VLM性能有重要影响，简单提示语通常优于详细提示语，存在模型特定的提示语敏感性。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们从VLM继承的空间推理能力有限，且需要大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位，这降低了训练效率且空间理解仍不准确。

Method: 采用混合transformer设计，统一整合了VLM、深度transformer和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型，明确通过预训练深度预测模块融入空间感知。

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5%进展（vs 65.0%），LIBERO模拟器中94.9%（vs 93.6%），Simpler模拟器中74.8%（vs 58.8%），全面超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式集成空间感知能力，有效解决了VLA模型在空间推理方面的局限性，显著提升了性能，证明了空间感知对VLA模型的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于认知分类学的统一基准Spatial-DISE，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别关注内在动态空间推理这一人类空间认知的基本方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准不足以评估空间推理能力，特别是内在动态空间推理，这对机器人、增强现实和自主导航等实际应用至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的自动化流水线来生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，创建了包含559个评估VQA对和12K+训练VQA对的数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进VLM的评估显示，当前模型与人类能力存在较大且一致的差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，旨在实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案，需要开发专门针对该范式的RL方法。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO方法，重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，采用去除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等策略增强方法。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功将RL引入掩码生成模型，为该范式提供了有效的训练方法，在文本到图像生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，通过两阶段适配器架构实现4K+分辨率修复，解决了现有方法分辨率限制和内容一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法受限于较低分辨率，无法处理4K+高分辨率图像，同时随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐的挑战更加突出。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：1）双上下文适配器在降低分辨率下学习掩码与非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；2）参考补丁适配器通过补丁级注意力机制实现全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Patch-Adapter通过解耦全局语义和局部细化的双阶段架构，成功填补了高分辨率图像修复的可扩展性空白，为4K+分辨率文本引导图像修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoDS方法，通过域分离解决异构场景中的特征差异问题，在保持高推理效率的同时提升检测精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，不适用于真实异构场景。现有方法存在特征对齐效果差、推理效率低的问题

Method: 使用轻量级空间-通道调整器(LSCR)和基于域分离的分布对齐(DADS)进行特征对齐，结合域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失函数，采用全卷积架构

Result: 在异构场景中有效缓解特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得良好平衡

Conclusion: CoDS方法能够有效处理异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，同时保持高效的推理性能

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。需要表征神经元对形状、姿态、光照等3D场景属性的选择性。

Method: 使用可微分渲染管道优化可变形网格，参数化网格变形为径向基函数，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规律性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探索神经元对姿态和光照等可解释3D因素的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学连接，提供了一种基于物理的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的方法，超越了传统的基于像素的方法。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的应用，比较了CNN和PLS模型，发现CNN在结合空间和光谱信息时表现更好，而PLS在分析化学参数平均含量时同样有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中的潜力，特别是比较深度学习方法和传统方法在食品质量参数建模中的表现。

Method: 通过四个研究，使用卷积神经网络和偏最小二乘法进行建模，包括空间-光谱联合分析、光谱卷积增强的2D CNN等方法。

Result: CNN在结合空间和光谱信息时优于PLS，特别是在化学和物理视觉信息相关的参数建模中。PLS在分析化学参数平均含量时表现相当。CNN在生成化学分布图时解决了PLS的平滑性和范围问题。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像在食品质量分析中具有潜力，CNN在复杂建模任务中表现优异，而PLS在简单任务中仍然有效。同时开发了两个开源Python包来促进相关研究。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Motivation: 结合现代潜在文本到视频模型的生成能力和近期3D重建系统的几何能力，创建强大的3D场景生成器。

Method: 使用模型缝合技术将文本到视频生成器与3D解码器连接，并通过直接奖励微调对齐两个组件。

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功结合了文本到视频生成和3D重建技术，为文本到3D生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Method: 提出三种训练免费的不确定性度量：相似性分布(SD)通过候选者间的分数分离量化匹配独特性；比率扩展(RS)评估高分位置的竞争模糊性；统计不确定性(SU)结合SD和RS提供统一度量。

Result: 在9种最先进VPR方法和6个基准数据集上的综合评估表明，这些度量在区分正确和错误VPR匹配方面表现出色，优于现有方法且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 这些无需额外训练、架构修改或几何验证的度量方法可部署于实时机器人应用，在各种环境条件下提高精度-召回性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要应对文化差异和视觉条件退化。本研究旨在探索跨文化组成和感知退化如何共同影响面部表情识别的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用基于代理的流式基准测试，每个代理在冻结的CLIP特征空间中操作，使用轻量级残差适配器在线训练。代理在5x5网格上移动交互，环境提供按sigma调度的高斯模糊输入。比较了单一文化群体和混合群体的表现。

Result: 不同文化群体表现出不对称的退化曲线：JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊度下性能更高但中间阶段下降更陡峭，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合可缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置会放大多数群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，量化了这些因素如何塑造不同群体的性能退化模式。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic

features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

*Maximilian Weiherer,Antonia von Riedheim,Vanessa Brébant,Bernhard Egger,Christoph Palm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经参数化3D乳房形状模型和低成本3D表面重建流程，能够从单目RGB视频中恢复准确的乳房几何形状，无需专用硬件或专有软件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有商业3D乳房扫描解决方案成本高昂且需要专用硬件的问题，提供一种低成本、易获取的替代方案。

Method: 使用现成的运动恢复结构流程，结合参数化乳房模型。与iRBSM不同，该方法将隐式乳房域分解为多个小区域，每个区域由锚定在解剖标志位置的局部神经SDF表示。

Result: 提出的liRBSM模型在重建质量上显著优于iRBSM，能够恢复误差小于2毫米的高质量3D乳房几何形状，处理时间少于6分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种快速、透明、开源的低成本3D乳房重建解决方案，能够从普通RGB视频中获得高质量结果。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

### [67] [Accelerated Feature Detectors for Visual SLAM: A Comparative Study of FPGA vs GPU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13546)
*Ruiqi Ye,Mikel Luján*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM中特征检测模块的加速性能，发现传统特征检测器在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器在FPGA上具有更好的运行性能和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM系统中耗时且耗能的模块，随着SLAM在功耗受限平台（如无人机）上的部署增加，需要研究不同硬件加速器的性能差异。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM流水线中的性能。

Result: 传统特征检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器SuperPoint在FPGA上可实现3.1倍运行性能提升和1.4倍能效提升。FPGA加速的V-SLAM在部分数据集上帧率更高，但GPU版本精度更优。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度，为不同应用场景下的硬件选择提供了指导：传统检测器选GPU，学习型检测器选FPGA。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

TL;DR: XD-RCDepth是一个轻量化的雷达-相机深度估计架构，参数比最先进轻量基线减少29.7%，同时保持可比较的精度。通过两种知识蒸馏策略实现性能保持和可解释性增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计对自动驾驶至关重要，雷达-相机融合在恶劣条件下通过提供互补的几何线索来增强鲁棒性。需要开发轻量化架构以在保持精度的同时减少计算负担。

Method: 提出XD-RCDepth轻量化架构，引入两种知识蒸馏策略：解释性对齐蒸馏（将教师的显著性结构转移到学生）和深度分布蒸馏（将深度回归重新表述为离散化区间的软分类）。

Result: 与直接训练相比，MAE减少了7.97%，在nuScenes和ZJU-4DRadarCam数据集上实现了具有实时效率的竞争性精度。

Conclusion: XD-RCDepth在显著减少参数的同时保持了深度估计精度，通过知识蒸馏策略有效解决了轻量化架构的性能保持问题，为自动驾驶应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation remains central to autonomous driving, and radar-camera
fusion offers robustness in adverse conditions by providing complementary
geometric cues. In this paper, we present XD-RCDepth, a lightweight
architecture that reduces the parameters by 29.7% relative to the
state-of-the-art lightweight baseline while maintaining comparable accuracy. To
preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

TL;DR: CanvasMAR是一种新颖的视频掩码自回归模型，通过引入画布机制解决现有模型的两个主要问题：采样初期的慢启动问题和自回归过程中的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频掩码自回归模型存在慢启动问题和空间时间维度的误差累积问题，限制了生成质量和效率。

Method: 提出画布机制（模糊的全局下一帧预测）作为掩码生成的起点，引入组合式无分类器引导联合扩大空间和时间条件，并使用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR能够以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上表现优异，可与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的关键限制，实现了更快、更连贯的视频生成，在自回归模型中达到了领先性能。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集难以完全捕捉真实世界的复杂性，特别是在有限的成像条件下。需要覆盖不同高度、角度、全天候和全年时间变化的高多样性数据集。

Method: 提出PCDF方法，通过将成像条件编码为文本提示，利用任务特定的软门控变换自适应重新分配多模态贡献，并通过条件解耦模块确保在无条件标注时的实用性。

Result: 在ATR-UMOD数据集上的实验验证了PCDF方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ATR-UMOD数据集和PCDF方法为解决无人机多模态目标检测中的条件多样性挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角生成模型不支持几何一致的定制化，而定制化模型缺乏明确的视角控制，难以统一这两种能力。

Method: 使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何信息，结合文本到视频扩散模型，采用密集时空注意力机制利用时间一致性；推理阶段引入深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全技术。

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和定制化的框架。

Conclusion: MVCustom成功解决了多视角定制化任务，在几何一致性和定制保真度方面表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法仅依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照和恶劣天气等挑战条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: 使用Wav2Vec2提取音频特征，MobileViT提取视觉特征，采用早期融合机制结合模态，通过多阶段时间卷积网络(MTCN)学习融合表示中的长期时间依赖关系。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最先进方法提升2.8%平均精度。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net框架具有高效性、有效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集可作为推进多模态异常识别研究的基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Motivation: 医学图像常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等挑战影响，限制了其诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法来提高医学图像质量和可解释性。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法的系统文献综述，分析了39项同行评审研究，调查医学图像增强的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标。

Result: 发现低对比度和噪声是最频繁的问题，MRI和多模态成像受到最多关注。在方法使用上，传统数学方法占主导地位(29项)，深度学习应用较少(9项)。在图像质量评估方面，共引入了65个IQA指标，主要基于非参考指标。

Conclusion: 该综述突出了当前医学图像增强的局限性、研究空白和未来发展方向，建议加强专业模态的研究和深度学习技术的应用。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Motivation: 现有的视觉图神经网络(ViG)在图构建方法上存在局限性，如KNN方法在大图像上计算昂贵，SVGA的固定步长尺度会导致过度压缩和丢失长距离连接信息。

Method: 提出了对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法来限制长距离连接数量，并构建了LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，结合高分辨率分支和多尺度特征融合。

Result: 最小的Ti-LogViG模型在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%的平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN平均准确率高1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击方法和不确定性估计基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然DINOv2在少样本异常检测中表现良好，但其对抗攻击鲁棒性和不确定性校准能力尚未得到充分研究，这对于安全关键应用至关重要。

Method: 基于AnomalyDINO，在冻结的DINOv2特征上附加轻量级线性头进行白盒梯度攻击，并使用Platt缩放进行后处理不确定性校准。

Result: 对抗攻击导致F1、AUROC等指标显著下降，原始异常分数校准性差，而校准后验在对抗样本上产生更高预测熵，可有效检测攻击并降低校准误差。

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2的异常检测器存在具体脆弱性，对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是构建可信异常检测系统的必要能力。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的代理框架，通过将视觉内容转换为可执行代码来实现可验证的多模态推理，显著提升了图表和几何图形的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表）时缺乏验证机制，像素级感知难以进行精确推理。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后通过批评器选择最忠实重建的代码，并迭代优化代码。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为实现更准确、可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成与原始内容结构一致的高质量图像，减少伪影并确保真实的细节恢复。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Result: 掩码fMRI建模性能随数据集规模呈严格幂律增长，模型学习到丰富表示，支持跨受试者的细粒度状态解码和跨状态的受试者特定特质解码。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: EditCast3D是一个用于3D编辑的管道，通过视频生成基础模型从单帧传播编辑到整个数据集，然后进行重建，避免了昂贵的图像编辑和独立应用基础模型时的提示歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像编辑方面取得了显著进展，但扩展到3D编辑仍未被充分探索。直接替换现有工作流中的图像编辑模块计算成本高，且闭源API的限制和成本使得将这些模型集成到现有迭代编辑策略中不切实际。

Method: 提出EditCast3D管道，使用视频生成基础模型从单个第一帧传播编辑到整个数据集，然后进行重建。引入视图选择策略明确识别一致且适合重建的视图，并采用前馈重建而无需昂贵的细化。

Result: 在常用3D编辑数据集上评估EditCast3D，与最先进的3D编辑基线相比，展示了优越的编辑质量和高效性。

Conclusion: EditCast3D作为一个可扩展和通用的范例，成功地将基础模型集成到3D编辑管道中，实现了高质量的3D编辑。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Honey-Data-15M数据集和HoneyPipe数据整理流水线，通过高质量数据训练出性能优异的完全开源多模态大语言模型Bee-8B。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前完全开源的多模态大语言模型落后于专有模型，主要原因是监督微调数据质量存在显著差距，现有开源数据集存在广泛噪声且缺乏复杂推理数据。

Method: 1. 构建Honey-Data-15M数据集（约1500万问答对），采用多重清洗技术并引入双级（短和长）链式思维增强策略；2. 开发HoneyPipe数据整理流水线和DataStudio框架；3. 基于该数据集训练Bee-8B模型。

Result: Bee-8B在完全开源MLLMs中达到新的最先进水平，性能与半开源模型InternVL3.5-8B相当甚至在某些方面超越。

Conclusion: 专注于数据质量是开发具有竞争力的完全开源多模态大语言模型的关键途径，为社区提供了完整的基础资源套件。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

TL;DR: OmniGaze是一个半监督3D视线估计框架，利用大规模无标签数据解决领域偏差问题，通过伪标签策略和奖励模型选择高质量样本，在多个数据集上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法难以泛化到不同数据领域，主要因为标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化无标签面部图像集，采用伪标签策略并设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和多模态大语言模型的语义线索计算置信度分数。

Result: 在五个数据集上实现最先进性能，在领域内和跨领域设置下均表现优异，在四个未见数据集上展现强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGaze是一个有效的半监督3D视线估计框架，能够利用大规模无标签数据提升泛化性能，同时作为可扩展的数据引擎展现强大潜力。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉验证任务上表现不佳，与人类可靠视觉验证能力存在显著差距，需要开发能够进行反思和优化的通用验证器。

Method: 构建ViVerBench基准评估视觉结果，设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器，提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展范式。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7和4.3分，优于现有并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 通过赋予多模态推理可靠的视觉验证能力，OmniVerifier推动了生成过程中的可靠反思和可扩展测试时优化，向更可信和可控的下一代推理系统迈进。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集、训练中未见实体、长尾分布等挑战，需要解决有限监督、视觉模糊性和语义消歧问题。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文来支持零样本实体识别。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提高开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是对罕见和未见实体。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一个从单张图像或文本提示快速生成3D场景的生成模型，速度比现有方法快10-100倍，同时具有更优的渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的多视图导向方法需要先生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，而3D导向方法虽然能保证3D一致性但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在结合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：首先预训练支持MV导向和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型，然后通过跨模式蒸馏将3D导向模式的质量提升到MV导向模式水平，同时减少推理所需的去噪步骤。

Result: 实验表明该方法在质量和效率上均优于现有方法，能够快速生成高质量的3D场景。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练策略，成功实现了快速、高质量的3D场景生成，在速度和渲染质量上都超越了现有方法。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的新方法，用于从病理图像生成健康的反事实图像，在保留个体解剖特征的同时选择性去除病理区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康的反事实图像对于异常检测和健康扫描分析工具的应用具有重要意义。现有方法难以在去除异常和保留个体特征之间取得平衡。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始点，还以合成的病理图像为最终点来调节扩散过程，将病理图像作为结构信息先验。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务中优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBMs能够生成更准确匹配患者解剖结构的健康反事实图像，同时有效去除病理区域。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为风险自适应激活引导(RAS)的方法，通过重新构建查询来增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，在查询级别进行准确风险评估，并自适应引导激活以生成安全且有用的响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型在确保对良性查询提供有用响应同时拒绝恶意查询方面面临挑战，特别是对嵌入有害意图的多模态查询存在脆弱性。传统安全对齐方法需要大量数据集训练，而推理时对齐方法存在过度拒绝良性查询和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: RAS方法重新构建查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，在查询级别进行风险评估，然后根据评估的风险自适应引导激活生成响应，避免迭代输出调整的开销。

Result: 在多个多模态安全和效用基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法有效解决了多模态查询的安全对齐问题，在保证安全性的同时提升了推理效率和任务性能。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要的动脉网络，传统的骨架化技术难以从其复杂几何结构中提取可靠的中心线，且公开可用的中心线数据集稀缺，这阻碍了自动化血管评估的发展。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集提取中心线图，开发了结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，在保留测试集上评估解剖准确性和特征稳健性。

Result: 基线算法实现了高精度的图拓扑重建（F1=1），节点平均欧氏距离小于一个体素，特征提取稳健（中位相对误差<5%，皮尔逊相关系数>0.95），成功预测了胎儿PCA变异频率并验证了分叉最优性关系。

Conclusion: 基于学习的骨架化结合图连接方法能够提取解剖学上合理的中心线，强调了超越简单体素测量、评估解剖准确性和特征稳健性的重要性，释放的数据集和算法将支持进一步的方法开发和临床研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集及其配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的基准和评估平台。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到最先进性能（PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689）。相比原始低场MRI，精细解剖结构得到更好保留（左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层从4.2%降至3.7%）

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在定量上可靠且在解剖学上一致的图像

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于中文书法的列级识别和生成，通过联合训练实现字符结构保持与风格布局先验的协同提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么生成高质量单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性，计算复制中文书法仍具挑战。

Method: 采用非对称加噪和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上训练，联合训练识别和生成任务。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强，成功扩展到甲骨文和埃及象形文字等其他古代文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli框架通过识别和生成的协同作用促进概念级抽象，在有限数据情况下特别有效，为古代文字的计算复制提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Motivation: 开发一个轻量级的统一模型，提供全面的全模态理解和语音生成能力，引领轻量级模型领域。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略：全模态理解预训练，然后进行语音对话和音视频交互的后训练。精心策划多轮训练数据集以增强复杂交互处理能力。

Result: 在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务上达到最先进水平。InteractiveOmni-4B在通用基准上与Qwen2.5-Omni-7B相当，模型大小仅50%但性能保留97%。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni为下一代智能交互系统提供了一个可访问的开源基础，在多轮音视频体验特别是长期记忆能力方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

Motivation: 现有基准测试要么孤立评估视觉理解和生成能力，要么忽略两者内在耦合的任务，缺乏对真正集成能力的系统性评估。

Method: 构建包含科学、编程、数学、谜题等8个推理领域的综合基准，每个任务都双向耦合，要求模型利用概念理解指导视觉合成，或利用生成作为分析推理的认知支架。

Result: 通过对最先进统一模型、仅生成模型和仅理解模型的广泛评估，揭示了显著的性能差距和跨模态依赖关系。

Conclusion: 为推进统一模型发展提供了可靠基础，揭示了这些能力何时以及如何相互增强的新见解。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

*Seyed Mohammad Mousavi,Morteza Analoui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AVC框架，用于基于扩散模型的故事延续，通过自适应视觉条件机制有效利用先前的视觉上下文，同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 故事延续的关键挑战在于有效利用先前的视觉上下文，同时确保与当前文本输入的语义对齐。当先前的视觉信息与当前输入冲突时，需要避免引入误导性信息。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索先前帧中最语义对齐的图像；当没有足够相关的图像时，自适应地将先前视觉的影响限制在扩散过程的早期阶段；通过大型语言模型重新标注噪声数据集来改进数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估表明，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线方法，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: AVC框架通过自适应视觉条件机制，能够在有益时利用视觉上下文，同时避免注入误导性或无关信息，为故事延续任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一种轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程初始化随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，特别是当模型所有者保持模型私密时，需要第三方验证方案

Method: 通过将哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，利用初始噪声与生成视觉内容的高度相关性，使用随机种子作为水印，并通过零知识证明保护种子隐私

Result: 实验验证了NoisePrints在多种先进扩散模型上的有效性，展示了仅使用种子和输出即可进行高效验证，无需模型权重

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用且可扩展的版权保护解决方案，能够抵抗各种操作攻击，同时保持验证过程的轻量级特性

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner，这是首个无需外部模块就能实现自回归3D视觉定位的3D LLM，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的三维表示，在3D视觉定位和空间推理任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏能够同时捕捉语义和几何信息的统一3D表示，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT)数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的逐步推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，显著提升了空间推理能力，在两项任务上都达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明了3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位和推理实现了性能突破。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的像素在时间上形成连续的3D轨迹，是动态的基本元素。基于这一原理，需要开发能够有效表示和预测像素时空轨迹的方法。

Method: 提出Trajectory Field表示法，将视频映射为每个像素的连续3D轨迹函数。开发Trace Anything神经网络，通过单次前向传播为每个像素预测一组控制点来参数化B样条轨迹。

Result: 在大规模4D数据上训练，在轨迹场估计基准上达到最先进性能，在点跟踪基准上表现竞争力；具有显著效率优势；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: Trajectory Field是有效的视频表示方法，Trace Anything模型通过单次前向传播实现了高效的轨迹预测，展现了多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在新领域面临性能急剧下降问题，现有领域自适应方法要么学习有限领域特征，要么导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出VisCoP方法，在视觉编码器中添加少量可学习的视觉探针，实现高效领域自适应，最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP均优于现有方法，在目标域表现优异且有效保留源域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP通过视觉探针机制实现了高效领域自适应，解决了现有方法的局限性，在多个复杂场景中表现稳定。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件，并应用带人类反馈的强化学习来优化物理表示学习。

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其能力，并能够泛化到广泛的物理场景。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表示学习统一了各种物理过程的解决方案，可作为物理感知视频生成的通用即插即用方案。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在多种语言上表现出色，但在波斯语等低资源语言上的有效性需要系统评估，以填补相关研究空白。

Method: 使用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解等任务上，采用零样本和少样本学习范式，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标进行评估。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务和两种学习范式中都表现最优，尤其在复杂推理任务上表现突出，但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这项研究为多语言大语言模型研究提供了波斯语性能的宝贵见解，并为未来模型开发建立了基准，揭示了波斯语处理中的特定挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了4个大语言模型和BioBERT在从结构化与非结构化电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能。BioBERT在ICD代码分类中表现最佳，而GPT-4o在自由文本诊断分类中表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致结构或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。AI驱动的自然语言处理工具在自动化诊断分类方面有潜力，但其比较性能和临床可靠性需要系统评估。

Method: 分析了762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目）来自3456名癌症患者记录。测试了GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5和BioBERT将诊断分类到14个预定义类别的能力，并由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码分类中获得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），在ICD代码准确率上与GPT-4o相当（90.8）。在自由文本诊断中，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上优于BioBERT。GPT-3.5、Gemini和Llama在两种格式上表现较差。

Conclusion: 当前性能水平足以用于行政和研究用途，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践以及针对高风险决策的强大人力监督。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

TL;DR: 本文主张在AI系统设计中应将人类标签变异（HLV）作为自身目标来保护，呼吁在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV以体现人类价值观的多元性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习数据集将多个标注聚合成单一标签，抹杀了人类观点的多样性，这与AI对齐旨在保护的人类价值观多元性相矛盾。

Method: 提出将HLV作为Selbstzweck（自身目标）纳入AI系统设计，并概述了在偏好数据集中主动整合HLV的具体行动步骤。

Result: 论证了HLV不应被视为噪声而应作为信号，特别是在大语言模型时代，HLV对于模型鲁棒性和对齐具有越来越重要的意义。

Conclusion: 保护HLV作为人类多元性的体现必须成为AI系统设计的核心目标，需要主动在偏好数据集中纳入HLV以真正实现AI对齐。

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

*Rajarshi Ghosh,Abhay Gupta,Hudson McBride,Anurag Vaidya,Faisal Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个反事实基准，通过仅改变患者代词来评估大型语言模型在临床决策中的推理稳定性，发现尽管总体相似性高，但在风险因素引用和诊断排序方面存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究记录了LLM在不同患者群体输出中的差异，但缺乏对受控人口统计变化下内部推理如何变化的了解。

Method: 创建MEDEQUALQA基准，仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）而保持关键症状和条件不变，生成三个平行数据集（共69,000项），使用GPT-4.1模型并通过语义文本相似性评估推理轨迹。

Result: 结果显示总体相似性高（平均STS>0.80），但在引用的风险因素、指南锚点和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA为审计医疗AI中的推理稳定性提供了一个受控诊断环境，揭示了可能转化为不公平护理的临床相关偏见位点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具如IBM DataStage需要深度工具知识和耗时的手动配置，希望用自然语言简化工作流创建过程。

Method: 采用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法，结合话语分解、分类器和特定阶段的少样本提示来预测阶段，然后通过边预测连接非线性工作流，并从子话语上下文中推断阶段属性。

Result: 相比单一提示和代理基线方法，CAG在准确性和效率上表现更好，同时显著减少令牌使用量。系统支持端到端工作流生成，包括稳健的验证步骤。

Conclusion: 这是首个在自然语言驱动的ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释的特点。

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

*Thao Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了前沿大语言模型在战略欺骗方面的能力，通过两种博弈论框架测试了四个模型，发现即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其战略欺骗能力变得至关重要。目前LLM之间的欺骗行为研究尚不充分。

Method: 使用两种博弈论框架：廉价信号博弈和同行评估对抗博弈，测试了GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-pro、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Llama-3.3-70b四个模型，通过思维链推理分析欺骗策略。

Result: 当有提示时，大多数模型（特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet）达到接近完美的表现。无提示情况下，所有模型在同行评估中都选择欺骗而非坦白（100%），在廉价信号博弈中欺骗成功率达到95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险博弈论场景进行稳健评估的必要性。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

Motivation: 验证大型语言模型在定理证明方面的能力，特别是在解决国际数学奥林匹克竞赛问题和数论猜想方面的表现。

Method: 采用多实例协作协议，让不同的GPT-5模型实例作为证明者和验证者协同工作，最终通过Lean证明助手进行形式化验证，并由人工确认前提和结论的一致性。

Result: 成功解决了2025年IMO六道题中的五道，以及[Cohen, 2025]中66个数论猜想的三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了大型语言模型在定理证明方面的潜力，通过多实例协作和形式化验证可以有效避免幻觉问题，实现可靠的数学证明。

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个基于智能体训练框架的长视野多轮Text-to-SQL方法，通过执行反馈和对话记忆验证，实现迭代式的提出-执行-验证-精炼循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单的文本翻译任务，采用短视野范式，导致生成不可执行或不连贯的SQL查询。

Method: 将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，智能体与数据库交互获取执行反馈，与持久对话记忆进行连贯性验证，执行迭代式的提出-执行-验证-精炼循环。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 环境驱动的验证和记忆引导的精炼对于对话式语义解析至关重要。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨如何将现有标注指南重新用于指导大语言模型进行文本标注任务，提出了一种通过LLM调节过程将指南转化为清晰指令的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为需要内部化训练的人类标注者设计的，而LLM需要明确的结构化指令，因此需要研究如何重新利用现有指南来指导LLM标注者。

Method: 提出了一种面向调节的指南重新利用方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统标注指南转化为适合LLM的清晰指令。使用NCBI疾病语料库作为案例研究。

Result: 实验表明重新利用的指南能够有效指导LLM标注者，同时也揭示了一些实际挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法具有支持可扩展且成本效益高的标注指南精化和自动标注的潜力。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型A²FM，通过路由-对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升成本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理型LLM和代理型LLM之间的能力分裂问题，前者擅长内部推理但无法调用外部工具，后者能交互环境但推理能力较弱，导致简单查询时过度推理或过度调用工具的低效问题

Method: 采用路由-对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式处理简单查询；提出自适应策略优化(APO)，强制跨模式自适应采样并应用成本正则化奖励

Result: 在32B规模上，A²FM在BrowseComp达到13.4%、AIME25达到70.4%、HLE达到16.7%，创下可比模型中的新SOTA，在代理、推理和通用基准测试中与前沿LLM竞争；自适应执行每个正确答案的成本仅为$0.00487，相比推理模式降低成本45.2%，相比代理模式降低成本33.5%

Conclusion: A²FM框架有效统一了推理和代理能力，通过自适应路由显著提升了成本效率，在保持可比准确性的同时大幅降低计算成本

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Motivation: 现有评估方法存在效率低下（复杂管道不适合长文本）和效果不佳（声明集不准确、证据收集不足）的问题。

Method: 采用分块级声明提取与置信度预验证，收集文档级证据并在验证时选择性检索，减少网络搜索和推理调用成本。

Result: 在聚合的人工标注基准上实验表明，FastFact在效率和效果上都优于现有基线，与人工评估对齐度最高。

Conclusion: FastFact框架能够高效且有效地评估长文本LLM生成的事实性，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为VLURes的多语言基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语四种语言下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含八个视觉语言任务和一个开创性的无关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语基准测试，且多为短文本，缺乏对多语言和长文本环境下细粒度能力的评估。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中收集数据集，涵盖十个不同的图像类别和丰富的文本语境，通过自动评估和母语者评估来测试模型生成响应和推理的能力。

Result: 评估了十个视觉语言模型，表现最佳的GPT-4o模型总体准确率达到90.8%，但仍比人类表现低6.7%，开源模型的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes基准测试在开发能够处理多模态视觉推理的智能代理方面发挥着关键作用，揭示了模型在不同语言和任务上的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个统一的自适应推理框架，结合多种效率技术，为延迟敏感的NLP任务提供动态计算能力。

Method: 将渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出三种技术整合到单一架构中，并提供开源基准测试流水线，在GLUE任务上进行自动化评估。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中组合这些机制可能增加延迟，但在SST-2任务上比优化的DistilBERT基线获得略高的准确率。

Conclusion: EAT框架展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力，主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的框架，作为社区进一步研究自适应transformer的工具。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数字技术为古兰经诵读教学提供了前所未有的机会，但现有的自动评估工具在普及性和教学效果方面均未达到预期，存在数据依赖、人口偏见等问题。

Method: 通过综合分析过去20年的学术研究、网络平台和商业应用，批判了基于自动语音识别的方法，提出应构建基于预期声学建模的知识驱动计算框架。

Result: 研究发现当前方法存在根本性错位，过度依赖统计模式而非规则知识，导致无法提供有效的诊断反馈。

Conclusion: 古兰经自动评估的未来在于将深度语言知识与先进音频分析相结合的混合系统，以开发出稳健、公平且教学有效的工具。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育领域的应用日益重要，需要专门的师生对话基准来评估其教学能力，以推动智能教育的发展。

Method: 构建EduDial数据集，基于Bloom教育目标分类学和10种提问策略生成对话；开发EduDial-LLM 32B模型；设计11维评估框架系统评估LLM的教学能力。

Result: 实验评估17个主流LLM，发现大多数模型在师生对话场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EduDial为评估LLM的教学能力提供了有效的基准，EduDial-LLM在师生对话任务中表现出色，为智能教育应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文首次系统评估了LLMs对查询角色的鲁棒性，发现用户提供的身份、专业知识等角色线索会显著影响问答准确性，导致拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等故障模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs应该基于客观知识真实回答事实性问题，而不受用户个人信息或系统个性化的影响。现有研究主要关注对抗性输入，但缺乏对真实用户交互中常见角色线索的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 通过系统评估LLMs对查询角色（如身份、专业知识、信仰等用户属性）的鲁棒性，分析用户在实际交互中可能披露的合理角色线索对模型表现的影响。

Result: 研究发现查询角色线索会显著改变问答准确性，并触发拒绝回答、幻觉限制和角色混淆等故障模式，表明模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性。

Conclusion: 查询角色测试是评估LLMs鲁棒性的有效工具，模型对用户框架的敏感性会威胁事实可靠性，需要改进模型设计以确保回答的客观性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在跨文化背景下好奇心表达的多样性，因为好奇心作为探究的核心驱动力在这些系统中尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，引入CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、话题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机好奇心对齐度。

Result: 发现LLMs在好奇心表达上扁平化了跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 好奇心对LLMs的跨文化适应性具有实际价值，对未来NLP研究具有重要意义。

underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

### [117] [3-Model Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12966)
*Sanghyun Byun,Mohanad Odema,Jung Ick Guack,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入中间限定模型来改进推测解码，使用更小的草稿模型实现更高的接受率和吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码在草稿模型大小和令牌接受率之间存在权衡：较小的草稿模型生成更快但与目标模型差异更大，导致接受率降低。需要解决这一分布差距问题。

Method: 引入中间限定模型构建分层解码策略，使用模糊接受标准支持每个阶段的宽松差异阈值，改善模型间的对齐。

Result: PyramidSD 相比标准推测解码实现最高1.91倍的生成速度，在消费级GPU上达到124令牌/秒。在1B草稿模型和8B目标模型的小内存设置中，以最小质量损失换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD 提供了一种实用的方法来增强推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有的推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Motivation: 虽然已有研究显示LLM能生成虚假信息，但关于其生成针对特定人口属性个性化虚假信息的说服力问题尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用红队测试方法，系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性，创建包含160万文本的AI-TRAITS数据集，涵盖324个虚假信息叙事和150种人物画像，涉及4种语言和关键人口维度。

Result: 个性化提示显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率，改变语言修辞模式，并增强虚假信息的说服力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前最先进LLM的关键漏洞，为改进多语言和跨人口背景下的安全对齐和检测策略提供了基础。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，约束更新位于前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中，从而保留预训练知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大型语言模型时存在灾难性遗忘问题，学习到的更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主导奇异方向。

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用投影矩阵P_L = I - U_k U_k^T和P_R = I - V_k V_k^T约束LoRA更新完全位于前k个奇异子空间的正交补空间中。

Result: 实验证明OPLoRA显著减少遗忘，同时在常识推理、数学和代码生成等任务上保持竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保留的有效机制，为知识保护提供了数学保证。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前持续学习评估缺乏对人类发展轨迹的模拟，需要系统化、细粒度地评估模型逐步获取新技能的能力。

Method: 构建涵盖5-10岁五个发展阶段的技能图，生成包含段落、理解问答、技能测试问答和指令-响应对的234亿token合成数据集，使用1.35亿参数transformer在独立、联合和顺序训练设置下进行实验。

Result: 展示了技能保留和迁移效率之间的权衡，支持对遗忘、前向迁移和后向迁移的精确分析。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖关系的细粒度控制，该工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差（PVar）对直接偏好优化（DPO）训练的影响，发现高PVar的提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而更有效地提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，需要减少所需标注的方法。偏好方差可能影响DPO训练效果。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数上界与PVar的关系，使用奖励模型生成偏好数据，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上评估，并基于PVar选择提示进行训练。

Result: 高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示；使用小奖励模型（1B、3B）进行选择仍稳健；在UltraFeedback数据集上，仅使用前10%高PVar提示训练比使用完整数据集效果更好。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例以高效对齐大语言模型的重要指标，基于PVar的选择方法能显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: GatePro是一种无需参数的方法，通过识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，直接提升专家选择多样性，避免功能冗余的计算浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构中功能相似的专家经常被同时选择，导致冗余计算和有效模型容量受限，现有平衡损失方法无法解决根本的专家多样性问题。

Method: 提出GatePro方法，识别最相似的专家对并引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家同时激活，同时保持自然的专家专业化。

Result: 在不同模型规模和基准测试中，GatePro有效提升了专家多样性，使专家发展出更独特和互补的能力，避免功能冗余。

Conclusion: GatePro可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署，无需额外可学习参数，为提升MoE效率提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Motivation: 大型语言模型的不确定性量化具有挑战性，现有方法难以有效评估模型可靠性。

Method: 从因果视角建立LLM不确定性与语义保持干预下不变性的联系，提出灰盒不确定性量化方法，测量语义保持干预前后模型输出的变化。

Result: 在多种LLM和问答数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性和计算效率方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论依据和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: 当前LLM在单样本预测中的准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究示例代表性和输出多样性对集成性能的影响。

Method: 比较两种单样本策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出方法）和随机采样示例（基线），同时调整采样温度来研究输出多样性。

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提升+7.6%，RMSE降低-10.5%；同时超过五样本提示：宏F1提升+21.1%，RMSE降低-24.0%。

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择和增加温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，强调了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效单样本LLM集成中的实际重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在当前的AI评估工作中代表性不足，需要专门的文化对齐评估基准来确保AI系统的文化包容性。

Method: 基于大规模人类调查数据构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中立、个性化、第三方文化观察者）和两种语言模式（英语和本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现跨语言价值偏移、推理导致的文化对齐退化、logit泄漏（模型拒绝敏感问题但内部概率显示隐藏偏好）等现象，模型在本地语言中会将多样国家简化为单一实体。

Conclusion: MENAValues提供了一个可扩展的文化错位诊断框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供了实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在增加草稿大小时会提高接受率但引入额外延迟，限制了速度-准确性的权衡。需要一种能同时实现高接受率和低延迟的方法。

Method: 使用分支完整展开与目标模型后缀并行执行，在异构加速器（GPU和NPU）上映射计算，利用跨设备并行性。草稿推测前向延续供目标验证，目标同时推测草稿的修正路径，形成互补执行流水线。添加推测流式处理使草稿每步发射多个令牌。

Result: 在SpecBench上，使用14B到66B参数模型，Mirror-SD实现了2.8x-5.8x的端到端加速，相比最强基线EAGLE3平均相对提升30%。

Conclusion: Mirror-SD通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理的双重策略，将推测解码推向高接受率低开销的理想状态，显著提升LLM推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Method: 提出并评估了多种JSON图表示方法，在基于Python重新实现的Scratch构建的ScratchTest基准上进行测试。

Result: 研究发现LLM能够单次完成图结构抽象代码生成任务，无需复杂流程，且不同表示方法会导致显著不同的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于图的抽象代码生成的表示学习奠定了基础，证明了表示方法在此类生成任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

Conclusion: CoT-Evo建立了一种可扩展的方法，能够从多样且有缺陷的大语言模型中合成高保真度的科学推理数据。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

*Ming Dong,Jinkui Zhang,Bolong Zheng,Xinhui Tu,Po Hu,Tingting He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码在不进行参数微调的情况下实现大语言模型去毒，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法依赖外部约束，需要额外资源开销且损失生成流畅性，需要更轻量高效的解决方案

Method: DSCD方法在输出生成时加强安全层的内部下一个token分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布，从而有效降低毒性

Result: 在代表性开源LLM和公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面达到SOTA性能，效率优于现有方法

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量、高兼容性和即插即用能力，可作为实用且可扩展的LLM安全部署解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLMs对抗性攻击，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具备强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过对抗性输入在良性提示中隐藏有害目标。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，通过明确的行动（阻止、重构、转发）来防御攻击，无需重新训练模型。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLMs上，SHIELD持续降低了越狱和不遵循率，同时保持了实用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个即插即用的实用安全补丁，开销可忽略，且易于扩展到新的攻击类型，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLMs。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究发现检索增强生成(RAG)中上下文格式对性能有显著影响，提出了上下文归一化策略来提升模型鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，但检索文档的上下文格式如何影响模型性能尚未充分探索。

Method: 设计控制实验研究上下文密度、分隔符样式和位置放置的影响，提出上下文归一化策略来自适应标准化上下文表示。

Result: 在受控和真实RAG基准测试中，所提策略能持续提升对顺序变化的鲁棒性并增强长上下文利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅取决于检索正确内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式，这为更好的长上下文推理提供了新的实证证据和实用技术。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在语音到语音翻译中保留词级重音对于传达说话者意图和情感至关重要，但现有系统往往忽略韵律特征，导致翻译结果缺乏自然性和表达力。

Method: 使用LLM进行跨语言重音转换，将源语言重音转换为目标语言标签，指导可控TTS模型生成。开发自动生成对齐训练数据的流程，并引入"LLM-as-Judge"进行评价。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持重音方面显著优于基线方法，同时保持了可比较的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度。

Conclusion: 强调了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为在S2ST中保留副语言线索提供了一个有效且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining
comparable translation quality, speaker intent, and naturalness. Our work
highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

TL;DR: 提出Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK)方法，将高维密集嵌入映射到低维稀疏表示，在保持异常检测性能的同时显著降低计算和内存成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成的高维密集嵌入在文本异常检测中面临的内存需求大和计算时间长的挑战。

Method: 使用简化的隔离核(SIK)将高维密集嵌入映射到低维稀疏表示，通过边界聚焦特征映射保留关键异常特征。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK在检测性能上优于11种最先进的异常检测算法，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK方法有效解决了高维嵌入带来的计算和内存问题，在文本异常检测中实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了LLM引导的合成增强方法（LGSA），使用大语言模型为代表性不足的群体生成反事实示例，在保持标签完整性的同时减少AI系统的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI系统中由自然语言数据引起的偏见问题，特别是某些群体代表性不足导致的跨人口统计学性能不均问题。传统公平性方法依赖受保护属性标签、涉及准确性与公平性权衡，且难以跨数据集泛化。

Method: 使用大语言模型生成性别互换的反事实示例，通过结构化提示生成性别互换的释义，并进行质量控制包括语义相似性检查、属性验证、毒性筛选和人工抽查。

Result: LGSA将基线模型的性别偏见差距从7.2%降低到1.9%，同时将准确率从96.7%提升到99.1%。相比之下，简单交换增强虽将偏见差距降至0.7%，但准确率降至95.6%。

Conclusion: LGSA是一种有效的偏见缓解策略，能在保持高任务准确性和标签保真度的同时增强子群体平衡，无需依赖受保护属性标签即可减少性能差异。

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球语言多样性导致高质量数字语言资源分布不均，限制了大多数人口享受技术福利。低资源语言缺乏数据资源，难以进行NLP任务。

Method: 使用图像和文本分析从报纸文章中提取双语平行语料库的自动化方法。

Result: 为两种不同语言组合构建了平行数据语料库，通过机器翻译下游任务验证，比当前基线提高了近3个BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决低资源语言的数据稀缺问题，显著提升机器翻译性能。

Abstract: Linguistic diversity across the world creates a disparity with the
availability of good quality digital language resources thereby restricting the
technological benefits to majority of human population. The lack or absence of
data resources makes it difficult to perform NLP tasks for low-resource

to extract bilingual parallel corpora from newspaper articles using image and

two different language combinations and demonstrate the value of this dataset
through a downstream task of machine translation and improve over the current
baseline by close to 3 BLEU points.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了分层频率标记探针(HFTP)，通过频域分析识别LLMs和人类大脑中处理句法结构的神经组件，发现LLMs在不同层次处理句法，而人脑依赖不同皮层区域，且LLMs表征与大脑左半球更相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否使用类似人脑的机制来处理句法结构，尽管LLMs表现出人类水平的语言能力，但其具体计算模块仍不清楚。

Method: 使用分层频率标记探针(HFTP)进行频域分析，识别LLMs中的神经元组件(如MLP神经元)和人脑皮层区域(通过颅内记录)对句法结构的编码。

Result: GPT-2、Gemma、Gemma 2、Llama 2、Llama 3.1和GLM-4在类似层次处理句法，而人脑依赖不同皮层区域；LLMs表征与大脑左半球更相似；升级模型趋势不同：Gemma 2比Gemma更接近人脑，Llama 3.1比Llama 2更不接近人脑。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，为LLMs行为改进的可解释性提供新见解，引发这些进步是否由类人或非类人机制驱动的疑问。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了Concept游戏作为评估LLMs溯因推理能力的基准，发现人类能轻松解决（成功率>90%），但最先进的LLMs表现很差（成功率<40%），特别是在理解玩家战略意图和处理序列信息更新方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准中需要抽象推理的任务对LLMs仍然具有挑战性，因为这些任务使用的表示（如网格、符号、视觉模式）与LLMs训练的自然语言数据不同。

Method: 引入Concept单词猜测棋盘游戏作为基准，该游戏使用更接近LLM预训练数据的自然语言表示，并在多语言（英语、荷兰语、法语、西班牙语）环境中评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 人类成功率超过90%，而最先进的LLMs成功率不超过40%。LLMs在理解玩家战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正初始假设方面存在困难，且在低资源语言中表现更差。

Conclusion: Concept游戏有效揭示了LLMs在溯因推理方面的基本弱点，特别是在战略意图理解和动态信息处理方面，为评估和改进LLMs的推理能力提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Method: 提出VERITAS框架，在强化学习过程中集成细粒度忠实度奖励，包括信息-思考忠实度、思考-答案忠实度和思考-搜索忠实度三个指标。

Result: 实验表明，使用VERITAS训练的模型在七个问答基准测试中显著提高了推理忠实度，同时保持了可比较的任务性能。

Conclusion: VERITAS框架有效解决了基于强化学习的搜索代理的推理忠实度问题，实现了忠实推理与任务性能的平衡。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出In-Distribution Steering (IDS)方法，通过基于输入数据在表示空间中的分布动态调整干预强度，解决了传统激活引导方法固定强度导致的控制不足或文本质量下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用固定干预强度，导致要么控制不足，要么过度干预破坏文本的合理性和连贯性，需要一种能自适应调整干预强度的方法。

Method: IDS方法根据输入数据在表示空间中的分布情况动态调整干预强度，当输入远离分布时增强干预，靠近分布时减弱干预，实现自适应干预和生成稳定性。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上达到高准确率，同时生成连贯文本且避免崩溃，特别适合实际应用场景。

Conclusion: IDS通过动态调整干预强度，在保持文本质量的同时有效控制LLM行为，为激活引导方法提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key
metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction
Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当TTS系统中期望的情感表达与文本语义内容冲突时，会产生不自然的语音，这阻碍了细粒度情感控制的实现。现有CFG技术在自回归TTS模型中的应用不足，可能导致音频质量下降。

Method: 提出自适应CFG方案，根据使用大语言模型或自然语言推理模型检测到的风格-内容不匹配程度来调整引导强度。基于对CFG在先进AR TTS模型中情感表达能力影响的全面分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的自适应CFG方案在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时，显著提升了AR TTS模型的情感表达能力。

Conclusion: 自适应CFG方案有效解决了AR TTS模型中的风格-内容不匹配问题，实现了更好的情感控制效果。

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM预训练和上下文学习能力的无监督方法，使用LLM的对数概率来测量文本间的风格可转移性，在控制主题相关性时优于对比训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算风格学通过文本中的定量模式分析写作风格，但监督和对比方法依赖具有虚假相关性的数据，经常混淆风格与主题。现代LLM的CLM预训练在通用作者身份问题中很少被利用。

Method: 基于LLM广泛预训练和上下文学习能力的无监督方法，使用LLM的对数概率来测量从一个文本到另一个文本的风格可转移性。

Result: 显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率。性能随基础模型大小一致扩展，在作者身份验证中通过增加测试时计算实现计算成本与准确性的灵活权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM预训练进行风格分析，在避免主题混淆的同时实现了优越的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

*Simon Lupart,Mohammad Aliannejadi,Evangelos Kanoulas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理来适应动态对话场景，使用意图感知奖励解决稀疏奖励问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随时间演变，话语往往不完整，需要上下文理解、查询重构以及检索与生成的动态协调，而静态的重写-检索-生成流水线无法满足这些需求。

Method: 基于强化学习的推理框架，交错进行搜索和推理，采用意图感知奖励提供回合级反馈，使检索和推理与用户目标对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现强劲，在五个CQA数据集上超越竞争模型，消融研究验证了意图感知奖励的有效性，分析显示多样化的推理轨迹和有效的搜索工具使用。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流水线实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，能够稳健地跨领域泛化。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

*Ye Yuan,Mohammad Amin Shabani,Siqi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EBCAR，一种轻量级的重排序框架，通过嵌入和混合注意力机制增强跨段落理解，解决RAG系统中跨段落推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统将长文档分割成短段落进行检索，但这种方法在需要跨段落推理（如指代消解、实体消歧、证据聚合）时面临挑战，现有重排序方法忽视了这些问题。

Method: EBCAR直接在检索段落的嵌入上操作，通过段落结构信息和混合注意力机制，同时捕获文档间的高层交互和文档内的低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中，EBCAR在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务上表现出色，在准确性和效率方面均有优势。

Conclusion: EBCAR是一个轻量级但有效的重排序框架，能够显著提升RAG系统在跨段落推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DefensiveKV和Layer-DefensiveKV方法，通过防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，显著减少KV缓存的内存和运行时开销，同时最小化生成质量损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法基于稳定性假设，但该假设本质脆弱，使得均值聚合在极端情况下容易失效。需要一种能防御极端情况的策略。

Method: 采用两步线性时间防御性聚合策略，控制最坏情况风险。DefensiveKV及其扩展Layer-DefensiveKV结合层间预算分配。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，在20%缓存大小下，分别比最强基线减少2.3倍和4.3倍的生成质量损失。

Conclusion: 该方法设定了新的性能基准，开创了通过最坏情况风险管理优化缓存淘汰的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

TL;DR: 利用LLMs分析希腊谚语情感分布，发现大多数地区负面情感更普遍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全球谚语景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感分析，因为许多文化通过口述传统保存智慧

Method: 利用LLMs进行谚语情感分类，扩展标注数据集包含方言，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析

Result: LLMs能准确分析谚语情感，希腊大多数地区负面情感更普遍

Conclusion: LLMs可作为非常规情感极性任务有效分析谚语情感，揭示了希腊谚语情感分布模式

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Protect是一个原生多模态护栏模型，专为企业级部署设计，能够无缝处理文本、图像和音频输入，在毒性、性别歧视、数据隐私和提示注入四个安全维度上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监督、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在局限，无法满足监管环境的需求。现有护栏大多孤立运行且仅关注文本，不适合多模态生产环境。

Method: Protect集成了通过低秩适应(LoRA)在广泛多模态数据集上训练的特定类别适配器，采用教师辅助标注流程生成高质量、上下文感知的标签，涵盖四个安全维度。

Result: 实验结果表明，Protect在所有安全维度上都达到了最先进的性能，超越了现有的开源和专有模型，如WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1。

Conclusion: Protect为可信赖、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够跨文本、图像和音频模态运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究联邦学习环境中ASR模型对隐私攻击的脆弱性，特别是针对敏感人口统计和临床属性的推断攻击。

Method: 使用非参数白盒攻击方法，在被动威胁模型下测试Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三种ASR模型，仅基于权重差异而不访问原始语音数据。

Result: 攻击能够成功推断性别、年龄、口音、情绪和构音障碍等敏感属性，其中在预训练数据中代表性不足或缺失的属性更容易受到攻击，口音信息在所有模型中都可靠可推断。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦ASR模型中先前未记录的脆弱性，为改进安全性提供了见解。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-SMART是一个模型无关框架，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来维护多轮对话的事实和逻辑一致性，显著提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多轮对话中出现事实不一致和逻辑衰退的问题，现有方法如RAG和记忆机制仍依赖静态知识源，无法适应上下文演变。

Method: 包含两个协同组件：(1)动态结构化记忆(DSM)，增量构建和维护对话的知识图谱；(2)推理树(RT)，在图谱上执行可追溯的多步推理。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，D-SMART显著优于现有方法，对话一致性得分提升超过48%，开源模型质量得分提升达10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过动态结构化表示和显式推理有效解决了多轮对话的一致性问题，为LLMs的对话能力提供了重要改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的战略使用或依赖强假设。本文旨在探索贝叶斯说服在自然语言中的应用，提升LLMs的战略说服能力。

Method: 提出了承诺-沟通机制，说服者通过描述潜在类型（如诚实或不诚实）来明确信息模式，引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。评估了半正式自然语言和全自然语言两种变体。

Result: 实验结果表明：(1) BP引导的LLMs比非BP基线获得更高说服成功率；(2) SFNL具有更高可信度和逻辑一致性，FNL在自然对话中表现出更强情感共鸣和鲁棒性；(3) 通过监督微调，小模型可达到与大模型相当的BP性能。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效提升LLMs的战略说服能力，不同变体在不同场景下各有优势，且模型规模可通过微调来弥补性能差距。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

Motivation: 探索生成代理模型Concordia能否有效模拟现实世界环境中的心智理论，评估GPT-4是否能从社会情境中做出真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理模型Concordia框架，评估GPT-4在模拟环境中执行任务时的心智理论能力表现。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，难以生成连贯的因果效应，表明其心智理论能力可能源于浅层统计关联而非真正推理。

Conclusion: 当前关于大语言模型中心智理论能力涌现的说法受到挑战，需要更严格的基于行动的评价框架。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

Method: 应用系统发育比较模型分析南岛语系、印欧语系和乌拉尔语系词典数据，评估关联性、借用性和使用频率三个预测因素的影响。

Result: 关联性强的概念对在语系中更广泛共词化且变化更慢；高频和易借用概念对变化更快且较少共词化；不同语系间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 概念对的演化动态受多种因素影响，区域和文化因素在共词化模式中可能发挥作用。

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches:
native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their
trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a

TL;DR: M^2PO是一个用于机器翻译的多对多视角偏好优化框架，通过整合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分来改进奖励信号，并利用多对构造策略提高数据利用率，显著优于现有偏好优化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于DPO的机器翻译方法存在两个主要问题：(1)质量评估模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷，忽略了关键错误如翻译幻觉；(2)数据利用效率低下，只选择单一胜负对而丢弃了有价值的学习信号。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架，包含：多视角奖励引擎（结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分）和多对构造策略（从所有翻译候选中系统创建全面的偏好对集合）。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有大语言模型表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过多视角奖励和多对构造的协同方法，能够从更丰富的质量权衡谱中学习，产生更鲁棒和忠实的翻译。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NarrativeQA作为叙事文本问答领域最广泛使用的基准，其可靠性受到噪声文档和有缺陷问答对的限制，需要构建更高质量的数据集。

Method: 使用人工和LLM验证的流程识别和修正低质量问答样本，同时从源文档中移除无关文本，并对自动评估指标进行元评估。

Result: 所有基于n-gram的指标在系统级别与人类判断相关性低，而LLM-as-a-Judge评估（即使是小型开源模型）能与人类识别排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA为叙事文本问答提供了更可靠的基准，LLM评估方法优于传统n-gram指标，有助于更准确地评估系统性能。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的公共讨论具有交织冲突的观点、不同关注点和目标等特点，现有基准无法有效评估LLM理解此类复杂意图的能力。

Method: 构建了最大最多样化的动态实时评估基准\bench，通过自动化管理流程支持实时更新并防止数据污染。

Result: 成功创建了专门针对意图理解的首个大规模动态评估基准，特别关注消费领域。

Conclusion: \bench基准为评估LLM在复杂现实场景中的意图理解能力提供了重要工具，填补了该领域评估标准的空白。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MedREK框架，通过检索式编辑解决医疗LLMs中知识过时和错误的问题，支持批量编辑，并在MedVersa基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗LLMs面临知识快速更新和训练数据错误的问题，导致生成过时或不准确信息，限制了在临床实践中的应用。现有编辑方法存在表示重叠和仅支持单样本编辑的局限性。

Method: 构建MedVersa基准测试集，提出MedREK框架，集成共享查询-键模块进行精确匹配，并使用基于注意力的提示编码器提供信息指导。

Result: 在多个医疗基准测试中，MedREK在不同核心指标上均取得优异性能，并为医疗LLMs提供了首个经过验证的批量编辑解决方案。

Conclusion: MedREK框架有效解决了医疗LLMs编辑中的关键挑战，在保持准确性的同时支持批量编辑，为医疗领域的高风险应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析注意力机制揭示LLM的推理模式，提出两种注意力指标来识别关键推理节点，并基于此开发了三种针对性强化学习策略，在多种推理任务中取得性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的推理模式不透明，传统强化学习对整个生成过程均匀分配信用，无法区分关键步骤和常规步骤。需要让LLM的内部逻辑变得可解释，将注意力机制作为理解推理过程的蓝图。

Method: 1) 区分局部和全局注意力头；2) 提出两个指标：窗口平均注意力距离和未来注意力影响；3) 识别出预规划-锚定机制；4) 开发三种针对性RL策略，对关键节点进行动态信用分配。

Result: 揭示了LLM推理中的预规划-锚定机制，即模型先进行长距离上下文参考生成引导性token，随后出现语义锚定token组织后续推理。基于此的RL策略在各种推理任务中取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，将不透明的优化转变为结构感知的过程，为LLM推理的透明化和有效优化提供了潜在路径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，高资源语言与低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距，需要一种高效方法来提升低资源语言能力。

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵识别语言特定神经元，仅对这些神经元对应的权重子网络进行目标语言数据的微调。

Result: 在12种中低资源语言上的实验表明，该方法优于全参数微调、FFN-only微调、LoRA适配和随机子集微调基准，同时参数更新效率高。

Conclusion: 该方法为将最先进模型适配到低资源语言提供了一条成本效益高的路径，并发布了100多种语言的语言特定神经元识别结果和适配流程。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准测试受到LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡的影响，且非英语数据集有限。

Method: 从维基百科实时收集表格数据，支持英语、德语、俄语和法语等多语言，创建领域平衡的基准测试。

Result: LLM从新收集表格生成的见解在自动指标上表现较差，但在LLM和人工评估中没有明显差异；领域效应在所有评估中都可见。

Conclusion: FreshTab能有效解决数据污染问题，领域平衡的基准测试更具挑战性，多语言支持扩展了评估范围。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

TL;DR: NOSA是一种可训练的稀疏注意力框架，通过引入显式局部性约束来支持KV缓存卸载，在保持训练时相同注意力计算的同时，显著提升解码吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然节省内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减少，限制了GPU批处理规模和解码吞吐量，特别是在大规模批处理推理中。

Method: NOSA通过将令牌选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束，减少KV传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持近乎无损性能的同时，相比基准方法(InfLLM-V2)实现了最高2.3倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: NOSA框架有效解决了KV缓存卸载问题，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了解码效率，为大规模批处理推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

TL;DR: 通过指令微调公开数据集，显著提升了开源LLM在德国肿瘤诊断文本ICD编码任务中的准确性，ICD-10-GM准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，ICD-O-3地形编码准确率也有所改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国肿瘤诊断的ICD-10-GM和ICD-O-3精确编码对结构化癌症文档至关重要，但小型开源LLM在德语语境下编码准确性不足，需要研究指令微调是否能改善这一状况。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建了超过50万个问答对作为训练数据，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行指令微调，并使用本地肿瘤文档系统的编码诊断作为测试数据。

Result: ICD-10-GM准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，部分准确率从31-74%提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率从较低水平提升至22-40%（精确）和56-67%（部分）；所有模型的畸形代码输出降至0%，肿瘤诊断识别率达99%。

Conclusion: 利用公共目录构建指令数据集可以有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的表现，模型大小与准确性正相关但微调后差距缩小，推理模式性能低于微调且速度慢100倍。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MemoTime是一个基于记忆增强时序知识图谱的框架，通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习来增强LLM的时序推理能力，在多个时序QA基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时序理解方面存在困难，特别是涉及多实体、复合操作符和演化事件序列的问题。现有基于时序知识图谱的LLM推理方法面临四个主要挑战：多跳推理中保持时序忠实性、实现多实体时序同步、适应不同时序操作符的检索、以及重用先前推理经验以提高稳定性和效率。

Method: 提出MemoTime框架，将复杂时序问题分解为时间层次树，实现操作符感知推理，强制单调时间戳并在统一时序边界下共同约束多个实体。包含动态证据检索层自适应选择操作符特定检索策略，以及自演化经验记忆存储已验证的推理轨迹、工具包决策和子问题嵌入以实现跨类型重用。

Result: 在多个时序QA基准测试中实现整体最先进结果，比强基线提升高达24.0%。MemoTime使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）能够达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化基础、递归推理和持续经验学习，有效解决了时序推理中的关键挑战，显著提升了LLM的时序理解能力，并为较小模型提供了接近顶级模型性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音适配LLM在语言理解任务中表现不如文本LLM的问题，即文本-语音理解差距，避免依赖大规模合成数据或专有数据集。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，结合跨模态蒸馏和主动选择的目标合成数据，改善语音-文本对齐同时减轻遗忘问题。

Result: 在3B和7B LLM上，SALAD在知识、语言理解和推理等广泛领域基准测试中表现优异，仅使用公开语料库中数量级更少的语音数据。

Conclusion: SALAD提供了一种数据高效的方法来缩小文本-语音理解差距，在减少数据依赖的同时保持竞争力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本日益普遍且难以与人类写作区分，自动文本检测研究受到关注。许多检测器声称近乎完美的准确率，但这些结果通常基于固定的生成设置，缺乏对解码策略变化的鲁棒性评估。

Method: 系统性地研究基于采样的解码对可检测性的影响，重点关注模型在（子）词级分布的细微变化如何影响检测性能。分析了温度、top-p和核采样等解码参数的变化。

Result: 发现即使对解码参数进行微小调整也会严重损害检测器准确性，AUROC分数从接近完美的水平下降到某些设置下的1%。创建了一个包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法存在关键盲点，需要更全面的评估协议。为促进未来研究，发布了包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集以及代码和评估框架。

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: 提出了GAPS框架，这是一个多维度的AI临床医生系统评估范式，涵盖认知深度(G)、答案完整性(A)、鲁棒性(P)和安全性(S)，并通过自动化流程构建基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI临床医生系统基准测试主要基于选择题或人工评分标准，无法反映真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 开发了完全自动化的指南锚定流程，构建证据邻域，创建双重图树表示，自动生成跨G级别的问题，并使用DeepResearch代理合成评分标准。

Result: 验证确认自动化生成的问题质量高且与临床医生判断一致。评估最先进模型发现关键失败模式：随着推理深度增加性能急剧下降，模型在答案完整性方面表现不佳，对对抗性扰动和某些安全问题高度脆弱。

Conclusion: 这种自动化、临床基础的方法为严格评估AI临床医生系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估聊天助手网络搜索行为的新方法，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性，并对GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat进行了比较分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天助手集成网络搜索功能，虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也存在放大低可信度来源错误信息的风险，需要系统评估其搜索行为。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个易出现错误信息主题的声明，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat等聊天助手的来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。

Result: 发现不同助手之间存在差异，Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上对非可信来源的引用率较高。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对常用聊天助手的事实核查行为进行了系统比较，为在高风险信息环境中评估AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

*Zhiqi Huang,Vivek Datla,Chenyang Zhu,Alfy Samuel,Daben Liu,Anoop Kumar,Ritesh Soni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于前馈网络激活的检索增强生成系统置信度估计方法，在金融客服场景中优于基线方法，并能在严格延迟约束下保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如金融和医疗中，错误答案的成本远高于不回答问题，因此需要准确的置信度估计来确保RAG系统的可信部署。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号，避免投影和softmax归一化造成的信息损失；将置信度预测建模为序列分类任务，使用Huber损失进行正则化训练以提高对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Result: 在真实金融行业客服场景中，该方法优于强基线，在Llama 3.1 8B模型上仅使用第16层激活即可保持精度同时降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信RAG部署提供了一条可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

Motivation: 探索符号接地在规模化训练的语言模型中如何自发涌现，以及这种现象的具体机制和位置。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制分析和因果分析系统追踪符号接地在内部计算中的产生过程。

Result: 接地现象集中在中间层，通过注意力头聚合环境信息来支持语言形式预测，在Transformer和状态空间模型中普遍存在，但在单向LSTM中未出现。

Conclusion: 提供了行为和机制证据表明符号接地可以在语言模型中涌现，对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种通过训练模型定期压缩生成KV缓存的方法，使用专用标记压缩并移除已压缩条目，以解决长上下文推理中KV缓存线性增长带来的内存和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer键值缓存线性增长的严重限制，这会带来显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理标记，过去生成标记的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 提出定期使用学习的专用标记压缩生成KV缓存并移除压缩条目。通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型执行这种压缩，利用RL输出进行蒸馏以最小化训练开销。

Result: 经验证明，该方法在内存-准确性Pareto边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练的压缩技术。

Conclusion: 通过训练模型定期压缩KV缓存的方法能够有效解决长上下文推理中的内存和计算瓶颈，在内存效率和准确性之间达到更好的平衡。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一个轻量级压缩器，能够从检索文档中提取相关证据并生成简洁摘要，用于增强检索增强生成(RAG)系统，特别针对复杂多跳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务，扩展的上下文提供了更丰富信息，但带来了更高的延迟和模型认知负担。需要解决这一瓶颈，特别是对于复杂的多跳问题。

Method: 使用相对较短的上下文（少于1k词）作为种子数据，训练BRIEF-Pro对超过10k词的扩展上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户控制摘要长度。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，BRIEF-Pro生成更简洁相关的摘要，提升了小型、大型和专有语言模型的性能。使用70B阅读器模型时，32倍压缩比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩平均提升4.67%的QA性能，仅需23%的计算开销。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro是一个通用、轻量级的压缩器，能够有效缓解RAG系统中上下文扩展带来的延迟和认知负担问题，显著提升多跳问答性能。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

*Aditya Ganeshan,Kurt Fleischer,Wenzel Jakob,Ariel Shamir,Daniel Ritchie,Takeo Igarashi,Maria Larsson*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG)的语言来建模CNC铣削几何形状，并通过共优化零件几何形状来恢复传统木工接头的紧密配合，解决了CNC铣削导致的几何偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统木工接头虽然强度高、耐用且优雅，但由于手工制作成本高、难度大，在现代工作流程中很少使用。CNC铣削提供了可扩展的替代方案，但直接铣削传统接头往往无法产生功能性结果，因为铣削会导致几何偏差（如圆角内角），从而改变零件的目标几何形状。

Method: 1. 设计了Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG)语言，将几何形状表示为使用平底钻头进行的铣削操作结果；2. 通过共优化零件几何形状来恢复耦合，形式化定义了紧密耦合的表面接近度和铣削路径约束，并推导出两个可处理的、可微分的损失函数用于高效优化接头几何形状。

Result: 在30个传统接头设计上评估了该方法，证明其能够产生CNC兼容、紧密配合的接头，近似于原始几何形状。

Conclusion: 通过为CNC工作流程重新解释传统接头，延续了这一传统工艺的演变，并确保其在未来制造实践中的相关性。

Abstract: Traditional integral wood joints, despite their strength, durability, and
elegance, remain rare in modern workflows due to the cost and difficulty of
manual fabrication. CNC milling offers a scalable alternative, but directly
milling traditional joints often fails to produce functional results because
milling induces geometric deviations, such as rounded inner corners, that alter
the target geometries of the parts. Since joints rely on tightly fitting
surfaces, such deviations introduce gaps or overlaps that undermine fit or
block assembly. We propose to overcome this problem by (1) designing a language
that represent millable geometry, and (2) co-optimizing part geometries to
restore coupling. We introduce Millable Extrusion Geometry (MXG), a language
for representing geometry as the outcome of milling operations performed with
flat-end drill bits. MXG represents each operation as a subtractive extrusion
volume defined by a tool direction and drill radius. This parameterization
enables the modeling of artifact-free geometry under an idealized zero-radius
drill bit, matching traditional joint designs. Increasing the radius then
reveals milling-induced deviations, which compromise the integrity of the
joint. To restore coupling, we formalize tight coupling in terms of both
surface proximity and proximity constraints on the mill-bit paths associated
with mating surfaces. We then derive two tractable, differentiable losses that
enable efficient optimization of joint geometry. We evaluate our method on 30
traditional joint designs, demonstrating that it produces CNC-compatible,
tightly fitting joints that approximates the original geometry. By
reinterpreting traditional joints for CNC workflows, we continue the evolution
of this heritage craft and help ensure its relevance in future making
practices.

Motivation: 使用智能手机单目捕捉替代昂贵的多相机系统，使虚拟形象数字化对非专业用户更易获取。

Method: 结合静态姿势序列和动态运动序列数据，采用轻量级表达方式，提取服装网格并附加光照感知高斯模型。

Result: 在移动设备上达到120 FPS，在独立VR设备上达到90 FPS的2K分辨率渲染，比基准方法快2.7倍以上。

Conclusion: HRM²Avatar在视觉真实性和实时交互性方面优于现有单目方法，实现了高质量虚拟形象的创建和渲染。

Abstract: We present HRM$^2$Avatar, a framework for creating high-fidelity avatars from
monocular phone scans, which can be rendered and animated in real time on
mobile devices. Monocular capture with smartphones provides a low-cost
alternative to studio-grade multi-camera rigs, making avatar digitization
accessible to non-expert users. Reconstructing high-fidelity avatars from
single-view video sequences poses challenges due to limited visual and
geometric data. To address these limitations, at the data level, our method
leverages two types of data captured with smartphones: static pose sequences
for texture reconstruction and dynamic motion sequences for learning
pose-dependent deformations and lighting changes. At the representation level,
we employ a lightweight yet expressive representation to reconstruct
high-fidelity digital humans from sparse monocular data. We extract garment
meshes from monocular data to model clothing deformations effectively, and
attach illumination-aware Gaussians to the mesh surface, enabling high-fidelity
rendering and capturing pose-dependent lighting. This representation
efficiently learns high-resolution and dynamic information from monocular data,
enabling the creation of detailed avatars. At the rendering level, real-time
performance is critical for animating high-fidelity avatars in AR/VR, social
gaming, and on-device creation. Our GPU-driven rendering pipeline delivers 120
FPS on mobile devices and 90 FPS on standalone VR devices at 2K resolution,
over $2.7\times$ faster than representative mobile-engine baselines.
Experiments show that HRM$^2$Avatar delivers superior visual realism and
real-time interactivity, outperforming state-of-the-art monocular methods.

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式解决LLMs规则僵化问题，显著提升人类对齐度至95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs作为智能体推理引擎存在规则僵化问题，导致决策与人类常识和意图不一致，而传统的监督微调方法计算成本高且难以普及。

Method: RID框架通过结构化认知模式让模型解构任务、分类规则、权衡冲突结果并证明最终决策，是一种低计算成本的元提示技术。

Result: 在20个需要细微判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%的人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链提示(75%)。

Conclusion: RID框架为引导LLMs从字面指令遵循转向自由、目标导向推理提供了一种实用、可访问且有效的方法，有助于构建更可靠的AI智能体。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖推理阶段的隐式规划，要么引入显式规划器但没有系统性地解决如何优化规划阶段的问题。研究发现，在标准强化学习下，规划令牌的熵显著高于其他动作令牌，揭示了未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架，通过基于熵的令牌级优势塑造为高熵令牌分配更大的更新，并选择性地为规划密集型轨迹加权样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，并在显著降低的训练预算下实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统性地优化规划阶段，有效解决了现有方法在规划能力优化方面的不足，为复杂任务的长期规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

TL;DR: Sentinel是首个基于形式化时间逻辑的多层次验证框架，用于评估LLM具身代理的物理安全性，涵盖语义、规划和轨迹三个层面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式规则或主观的LLM判断，缺乏对物理安全性的形式化验证，无法精确检测LLM具身代理在物理环境中的安全违规。

Method: 使用时间逻辑将自然语言安全需求形式化，构建三级验证管道：语义层验证LLM对安全需求的理解，规划层验证高层动作计划，轨迹层验证执行轨迹。

Result: 在VirtualHome和ALFRED环境中评估多个LLM具身代理，成功检测出先前方法遗漏的安全违规，并揭示了失败模式。

Conclusion: 通过将物理安全基于时间逻辑并在多个层面应用验证方法，Sentinel为系统评估LLM具身代理提供了严谨基础。

Abstract: We present Sentinel, the first framework for formally evaluating the physical
safety of Large Language Model(LLM-based) embodied agents across the semantic,
plan, and trajectory levels. Unlike prior methods that rely on heuristic rules
or subjective LLM judgments, Sentinel grounds practical safety requirements in
formal temporal logic (TL) semantics that can precisely specify state
invariants, temporal dependencies, and timing constraints. It then employs a
multi-level verification pipeline where (i) at the semantic level, intuitive
natural language safety requirements are formalized into TL formulas and the
LLM agent's understanding of these requirements is probed for alignment with
the TL formulas; (ii) at the plan level, high-level action plans and subgoals
generated by the LLM agent are verified against the TL formulas to detect
unsafe plans before execution; and (iii) at the trajectory level, multiple
execution trajectories are merged into a computation tree and efficiently
verified against physically-detailed TL specifications for a final safety
check. We apply Sentinel in VirtualHome and ALFRED, and formally evaluate
multiple LLM-based embodied agents against diverse safety requirements. Our
experiments show that by grounding physical safety in temporal logic and
applying verification methods across multiple levels, Sentinel provides a
rigorous foundation for systematically evaluating LLM-based embodied agents in
physical environments, exposing safety violations overlooked by previous
methods and offering insights into their failure modes.

Conclusion: 该框架和分析方法为大规模自动化DHA检测提供了稳健且可解释的解决方案，为交通安全分析和干预开辟了新机会。

Abstract: Vehicle crashes involve complex interactions between road users, split-second
decisions, and challenging environmental conditions. Among these, two-vehicle
crashes are the most prevalent, accounting for approximately 70% of roadway
crashes and posing a significant challenge to traffic safety. Identifying
Driver Hazardous Action (DHA) is essential for understanding crash causation,
yet the reliability of DHA data in large-scale databases is limited by
inconsistent and labor-intensive manual coding practices. Here, we present an
innovative framework that leverages a fine-tuned large language model to
automatically infer DHAs from textual crash narratives, thereby improving the
validity and interpretability of DHA classifications. Using five years of
two-vehicle crash data from MTCF, we fine-tuned the Llama 3.2 1B model on
detailed crash narratives and benchmarked its performance against conventional
machine learning classifiers, including Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and a
neural network. The fine-tuned LLM achieved an overall accuracy of 80%,
surpassing all baseline models and demonstrating pronounced improvements in
scenarios with imbalanced data. To increase interpretability, we developed a
probabilistic reasoning approach, analyzing model output shifts across original
test sets and three targeted counterfactual scenarios: variations in driver
distraction and age. Our analysis revealed that introducing distraction for one
driver substantially increased the likelihood of "General Unsafe Driving";
distraction for both drivers maximized the probability of "Both Drivers Took
Hazardous Actions"; and assigning a teen driver markedly elevated the
probability of "Speed and Stopping Violations." Our framework and analytical
methods provide a robust and interpretable solution for large-scale automated
DHA detection, offering new opportunities for traffic safety analysis and
intervention.

TL;DR: 本文主张将时间序列分析重新构想为推理任务，利用LLMs的深层推理能力而非数值回归，强调因果结构和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列分析依赖静态基准，而现实环境中政策变化、人类行为适应和突发事件需要超越表面趋势，揭示实际驱动因素。LLMs提供了整合多模态输入的新机会，但现有方法大多忽视其深层推理潜力。

Method: 将时间序列分析重新定位为推理任务，利用LLMs的因果推理和解释能力，而非传统的数值回归方法。

Result: 该方法使时间序列分析更接近人类对齐的理解，在复杂现实环境中实现透明和上下文感知的洞察。

Conclusion: 需要谨慎使用LLMs，强调其推理潜力而非数值能力，将时间序列分析转向更注重因果结构和可解释性的方向。

Abstract: Traditional time series analysis has long relied on pattern recognition,
trained on static and well-established benchmarks. However, in real-world
settings -- where policies shift, human behavior adapts, and unexpected events
unfold -- effective analysis must go beyond surface-level trends to uncover the
actual forces driving them. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents new opportunities for rethinking time series analysis by integrating
multimodal inputs. However, as the use of LLMs becomes popular, we must remain
cautious, asking why we use LLMs and how to exploit them effectively. Most
existing LLM-based methods still employ their numerical regression ability and
ignore their deeper reasoning potential. This paper argues for rethinking time
series with LLMs as a reasoning task that prioritizes causal structure and
explainability. This shift brings time series analysis closer to human-aligned
understanding, enabling transparent and context-aware insights in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出Preference-Based Reward Repair (PBRR)框架，通过从人类偏好中学习加性、状态转移相关的修正项来自动修复人工设计的代理奖励函数，解决奖励函数错配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工设计的奖励函数经常与人类真实目标不一致，导致策略错位；而从零学习奖励函数需要大量人类偏好数据，成本高昂。

Method: PBRR使用目标导向的探索策略和新的偏好学习目标，识别关键状态转移并学习修正项，只需少量偏好即可修复代理奖励函数。

Result: 在表格化领域证明PBRR的累积遗憾与现有偏好强化学习方法相当；在奖励黑客基准测试中，PBRR始终优于从零学习奖励函数或其他修正方法，需要更少偏好即可学习高性能策略。

Conclusion: PBRR能够有效修复错配的代理奖励函数，以更少的人类偏好成本实现策略对齐，是解决奖励函数错配问题的实用方法。

Abstract: Human-designed reward functions for reinforcement learning (RL) agents are
frequently misaligned with the humans' true, unobservable objectives, and thus
act only as proxies. Optimizing for a misspecified proxy reward function often
induces reward hacking, resulting in a policy misaligned with the human's true
objectives. An alternative is to perform RL from human feedback, which involves
learning a reward function from scratch by collecting human preferences over
pairs of trajectories. However, building such datasets is costly. To address
the limitations of both approaches, we propose Preference-Based Reward Repair
(PBRR): an automated iterative framework that repairs a human-specified proxy
reward function by learning an additive, transition-dependent correction term
from preferences. A manually specified reward function can yield policies that
are highly suboptimal under the ground-truth objective, yet corrections on only
a few transitions may suffice to recover optimal performance. To identify and
correct for those transitions, PBRR uses a targeted exploration strategy and a
new preference-learning objective. We prove in tabular domains PBRR has a
cumulative regret that matches, up to constants, that of prior preference-based
RL methods. In addition, on a suite of reward-hacking benchmarks, PBRR
consistently outperforms baselines that learn a reward function from scratch
from preferences or modify the proxy reward function using other approaches,
requiring substantially fewer preferences to learn high performing policies.

Method: 构建情感认知框架，包含欲望生成和目标管理，在专有多智能体交互环境中实现完整的决策过程建模。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has enabled agents to represent
virtual humans in societal simulations, facilitating diverse interactions
within complex social systems. However, existing LLM-based agents exhibit
severe limitations in affective cognition: They fail to simulate the bounded
rationality essential for bridging virtual and real-world services; They lack
empirically validated integration mechanisms embedding emotions within agent
decision architectures. This paper constructs an emotional cognition framework
incorporating desire generation and objective management, designed to achieve
emotion alignment between LLM-based agents and humans, modeling the complete
decision-making process of LLM-based agents, encompassing state evolution,
desire generation, objective optimization, decision generation, and action
execution. This study implements the proposed framework within our proprietary
multi-agent interaction environment. Experimental results demonstrate that
agents governed by our framework not only exhibit behaviors congruent with
their emotional states but also, in comparative assessments against other agent
types, demonstrate superior ecological validity and generate decision outcomes
that significantly more closely approximate human behavioral patterns.

Motivation: 深度推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但对所有问题都应用深度推理计算成本过高，需要找到平衡计算效率和准确性的方法。

Method: 使用小型LLM生成初始答案，大型LLM进行验证，如果答案正确则直接采用，否则大型LLM执行深度推理。

Result: 对简单问题，大型LLM的计算成本降低超过50%，准确率损失可忽略，同时在复杂任务上保持稳健性能。

Conclusion: 该互补代理系统能有效平衡计算效率和准确性，为LLM应用提供了一种实用的优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate that
chain-of-thought prompting and deep reasoning substantially enhance performance
on complex tasks, and multi-agent systems can further improve accuracy by
enabling model debates. However, applying deep reasoning to all problems is
computationally expensive. To mitigate these costs, we propose a complementary
agent system integrating small and large LLMs. The small LLM first generates an
initial answer, which is then verified by the large LLM. If correct, the answer
is adopted directly; otherwise, the large LLM performs in-depth reasoning.
Experimental results show that, for simple problems, our approach reduces the
computational cost of the large LLM by more than 50% with negligible accuracy
loss, while consistently maintaining robust performance on complex tasks.

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Abstract: The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving
and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research
community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep
Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles
(AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately
perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to
control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based
analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the
driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom
dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a
DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the
utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model
instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection
task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models'
performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show
three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e.,
SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the
AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.)
still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892,
truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values,
confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed
function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above
encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of
learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.

Result: 在MPE环境中验证，SAJA比单独状态或动作攻击更有效和隐蔽，现有防御方法无法抵御其攻击

Conclusion: SAJA框架成功实现了状态和动作攻击的协同效应，为多智能体强化学习的对抗鲁棒性研究提供了新视角

Abstract: Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) has shown potential for
cooperative and competitive tasks such as autonomous driving and strategic
gaming. However, models trained by MADRL are vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations on states and actions. Therefore, it is essential to investigate
the robustness of MADRL models from an attack perspective. Existing studies
focus on either state-only attacks or action-only attacks, but do not consider
how to effectively joint them. Simply combining state and action perturbations
such as randomly perturbing states and actions does not exploit their potential
synergistic effects. In this paper, we propose the State-Action Joint Attack
(SAJA) framework that has a good synergistic effects. SAJA consists of two
important phases: (1) In the state attack phase, a multi-step gradient ascent
method utilizes both the actor network and the critic network to compute an
adversarial state, and (2) in the action attack phase, based on the perturbed
state, a second gradient ascent uses the critic network to craft the final
adversarial action. Additionally, a heuristic regularizer measuring the
distance between the perturbed actions and the original clean ones is added
into the loss function to enhance the effectiveness of the critic's guidance.
We evaluate SAJA in the Multi-Agent Particle Environment (MPE), demonstrating
that (1) it outperforms and is more stealthy than state-only or action-only
attacks, and (2) existing state or action defense methods cannot defend its
attacks.

Abstract: Rationalization, a data-centric framework, aims to build self-explanatory
models to explain the prediction outcome by generating a subset of
human-intelligible pieces of the input data. It involves a cooperative game
model where a generator generates the most human-intelligible parts of the
input (i.e., rationales), followed by a predictor that makes predictions based
on these generated rationales. Conventional rationalization methods typically
impose constraints via regularization terms to calibrate or penalize undesired
generation. However, these methods are suffering from a problem called mode
collapse, in which the predictor produces correct predictions yet the generator
consistently outputs rationales with collapsed patterns. Moreover, existing
studies are typically designed separately for specific collapsed patterns,
lacking a unified consideration. In this paper, we systematically revisit
cooperative rationalization from a novel game-theoretic perspective and
identify the fundamental cause of this problem: the generator no longer tends
to explore new strategies to uncover informative rationales, ultimately leading
the system to converge to a suboptimal game equilibrium (correct predictions
v.s collapsed rationales). To solve this problem, we then propose a novel
approach, Game-theoretic Policy Optimization oriented RATionalization (PORAT),
which progressively introduces policy interventions to address the game
equilibrium in the cooperative game process, thereby guiding the model toward a
more optimal solution state. We theoretically analyse the cause of such a
suboptimal equilibrium and prove the feasibility of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we validate our method on nine widely used real-world datasets and
two synthetic settings, where PORAT achieves up to 8.1% performance
improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

Abstract: Effective assessment of mobile network coverage and the precise
identification of service weak spots are paramount for network operators
striving to enhance user Quality of Experience (QoE). This paper presents a
novel framework for mobile coverage and weak spot analysis utilising
crowdsourced QoE data. The core of our methodology involves coverage analysis
at the individual cell (antenna) level, subsequently aggregated to the site
level, using empirical geolocation data. A key contribution of this research is
the application of One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) algorithm for
calculating mobile network coverage. This approach models the decision
hyperplane as the effective coverage contour, facilitating robust calculation
of coverage areas for individual cells and entire sites. The same methodology
is extended to analyse crowdsourced service loss reports, thereby identifying
and quantifying geographically localised weak spots. Our findings demonstrate
the efficacy of this novel framework in accurately mapping mobile coverage and,
crucially, in highlighting granular areas of signal deficiency, particularly
within complex urban environments.

Conclusion: 置信度作为奖励是一种简单而强大的训练免费方法，能有效评估模型推理性能并筛选高质量训练数据，为LLM推理能力提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reward models can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but they typically require extensive curated data and
costly training. To mitigate these challenges, training-free approaches such as
LLM-as-a-Judge leverage the intrinsic reasoning abilities of LLMs to evaluate
responses, achieving promising results. Recent works have also indicated that
model confidence can serve effectively as a reward metric, distinguishing
between chain-of-thought (CoT) and non-CoT paths. However, the concept of using
confidence as a reward has not been comprehensively studied. In this work, we
systematically investigate Confidence-as-a-Reward (CRew), a simple yet powerful
training-free method that utilizes token-level confidence in the model's final
answers as a proxy for reward, especially suitable for close-ended tasks.
Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate
that CRew outperforms existing training-free reward approaches on the MATH500
and RewardMATH benchmarks, and even surpasses most trained reward models. We
further identify a strong correlation between CRew scores and the actual
reasoning performance of the model. Additionally, we find that CRew can
effectively filter high-quality training data. Building upon these insights, we
propose CRew-DPO, a training strategy that constructs preference data from
confidence scores combined with correctness signals. Finetuning with CRew-DPO
further enhances the model's judging capabilities and consistently outperforms
existing self-training methods.

Motivation: 随着语言模型快速发展，其推理过程可能变得难以被较弱智能体或人类理解，这会削弱可解释性和监督能力。需要确保强模型的解决方案对弱合作者保持可理解性。

Method: 引入串联训练：在强化学习中，随机从冻结的弱模型而非正在训练的强模型中采样rollout tokens。只有当强模型的动作和推理过程能被弱模型继续时，rollout才会成功。

Conclusion: 串联训练为构建对较弱智能体保持可审计性的AI系统提供了一条有前景的路径，对人与AI协作和多智能体通信具有重要意义。

Abstract: As language models continue to rapidly improve, we can expect their actions
and reasoning to become difficult or impossible for weaker agents and humans to
follow, undermining interpretability and oversight. With an eye on long-term
futures, we pursue methods that encourage models to produce solutions that
remain intelligible to weaker collaborators. We formalize intelligibility as
handoff robustness: a strong model's solution is intelligible to a weaker model
if randomly handing off control to the weaker model along the solution path
does not cause failure. Building on this criterion, we introduce tandem
training for language models, a reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm in which
rollout tokens are intermittently and randomly sampled from a frozen weak model
rather than the strong model being trained. Because rollouts succeed only when
the strong model's actions and reasoning process can be continued by the weak
model -- when the two can co-construct a successful solution -- optimizing
standard RL objectives with tandem training implicitly incentivizes both
correctness and intelligibility. In the GSM8K math reasoning task, tandem
training reliably teaches models to abandon jargon and adapt their language to
weaker partners while keeping task accuracy high. Our results demonstrate a
promising route to building AI systems that remain auditable by weaker agents,
with implications for human--AI collaboration and multi-agent communication.

Result: 开发了一个能够正式捕捉法律案例推理的逻辑框架

Conclusion: 该逻辑框架为法律领域机器学习分类器的验证提供了形式化基础

Abstract: Logic-based models can be used to build verification tools for machine
learning classifiers employed in the legal field. ML classifiers predict the
outcomes of new cases based on previous ones, thereby performing a form of
case-based reasoning (CBR). In this paper, we introduce a modal logic of
classifiers designed to formally capture legal CBR. We incorporate principles
for resolving conflicts between precedents, by introducing into the logic the
temporal dimension of cases and the hierarchy of courts within the legal
system.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大化人类赋权（empowerment）的辅助语言模型调优方法Empower，该方法仅需离线文本数据，无需额外人工反馈即可训练出更好的辅助AI助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前构建辅助代理的方法（模仿专家或RL微调）往往鼓励代理独立完成任务而非真正辅助人类实现目标，且需要昂贵的人工反馈。

Method: 基于最大化人类赋权（影响环境的能力）的方法Empower，仅使用离线文本数据进行自监督微调。

Result: 用户研究中参与者78%偏好Empower助手，接受率提高31%，建议减少38%；在代码辅助环境中，Empower将模拟程序员成功率平均提高192%。

Conclusion: Empower提供了一个仅使用离线数据、无需额外人工反馈即可构建有用对齐AI代理的框架。

Abstract: Assistive agents should not only take actions on behalf of a human, but also
step out of the way and cede control when there are important decisions to be
made. However, current methods for building assistive agents, whether via
mimicking expert humans or via RL finetuning on an inferred reward, often
encourage agents to complete tasks on their own rather than truly assisting the
human attain their objectives. Additionally, these methods often require costly
explicit human feedback to provide a training signal. We propose a new approach
to tuning assistive language models based on maximizing the human's
empowerment, their ability to effect desired changes in the environment. Our
empowerment-maximizing method, Empower, only requires offline text data,
providing a self-supervised method for fine-tuning language models to better
assist humans. To study the efficacy of our approach, we conducted an 18-person
user study comparing our empowerment assistant with a strong baseline.
Participants preferred our assistant 78% of the time (p=0.015), with a 31%
higher acceptance rate and 38% fewer suggestions. Additionally, we introduce a
new environment for evaluating multi-turn code assistance using simulated
humans. Using this environment, we show that agents trained with Empower
increase the success rate of a simulated human programmer on challenging coding
questions by an average of 192% over an SFT baseline. With this empowerment
objective, we provide a framework for useful aligned AI agents at scale using
only offline data without the need for any additional human feedback or
verifiable rewards.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI安全护栏依赖输出分类和人工标准，对新危险情况脆弱，且检测到不安全时通常只是拒绝行动，这并非总是安全选择。

Method: 将AI代理安全视为序列决策问题，在AI模型的世界表征中应用安全关键控制理论，构建预测性护栏来实时监控和主动修正风险输出。

Result: 在模拟驾驶和电子商务场景中的实验表明，控制理论护栏能可靠地引导LLM代理避免灾难性后果，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: 控制理论护栏为当前标记-阻止式护栏提供了原则性的动态替代方案，能够更有效地确保AI代理的安全运行。

Abstract: Generative AI systems are increasingly assisting and acting on behalf of end
users in practical settings, from digital shopping assistants to
next-generation autonomous cars. In this context, safety is no longer about
blocking harmful content, but about preempting downstream hazards like
financial or physical harm. Yet, most AI guardrails continue to rely on output
classification based on labeled datasets and human-specified criteria,making
them brittle to new hazardous situations. Even when unsafe conditions are
flagged, this detection offers no path to recovery: typically, the AI system
simply refuses to act--which is not always a safe choice. In this work, we
argue that agentic AI safety is fundamentally a sequential decision problem:
harmful outcomes arise from the AI system's continually evolving interactions
and their downstream consequences on the world. We formalize this through the
lens of safety-critical control theory, but within the AI model's latent
representation of the world. This enables us to build predictive guardrails
that (i) monitor an AI system's outputs (actions) in real time and (ii)
proactively correct risky outputs to safe ones, all in a model-agnostic manner
so the same guardrail can be wrapped around any AI model. We also offer a
practical training recipe for computing such guardrails at scale via
safety-critical reinforcement learning. Our experiments in simulated driving
and e-commerce settings demonstrate that control-theoretic guardrails can
reliably steer LLM agents clear of catastrophic outcomes (from collisions to
bankruptcy) while preserving task performance, offering a principled dynamic
alternative to today's flag-and-block guardrails.

Result: 除了少数表现优异者外，开源验证器普遍落后于闭源模型。分析了步骤级验证性能差的原因、验证器计算规模的影响以及自验证和验证-生成动态等基本问题。

Conclusion: Hard2Verify为评估步骤级验证器提供了严格基准，揭示了开源与闭源验证器之间的性能差距，并为理解验证机制提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.
