### [1] [Teamwork: Collaborative Diffusion with Low-rank Coordination and Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05532)
*Sam Sartor,Pieter Peers*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一个灵活统一的解决方案，通过协调多个基础扩散模型实例来扩展输入输出通道，无需改变预训练模型架构，适用于多种图形任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常是特定于应用的，难以适应不同的扩散模型或新任务，需要一种更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 使用多个基础扩散模型实例作为队友，采用新颖的LoRA变体进行联合适应和协调，支持队友的动态激活/停用。

Result: 在多种生成和逆图形任务上展示了灵活性和效率，包括修复、SVBRDF估计、本征分解、神经着色和本征图像合成。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种高效统一的通道扩展方法，能够适应不同的扩散模型和新任务，具有很好的灵活性。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

### [2] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出增强特征金字塔网络(E-FPN)框架，用于基础设施检查中的少样本语义分割，通过原型学习和注意力机制在数据稀缺情况下实现高效缺陷检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础设施检查应用中标注训练样本稀缺且昂贵，现有深度学习框架需要大量标注数据且难以用少量数据学习新的缺陷类别。

Method: 采用增强特征金字塔网络编码器，结合InceptionSepConv块和深度可分离卷积进行多尺度特征提取；使用原型学习和掩码平均池化从少量支持样本生成强大原型；通过全局自注意力、局部自注意力和交叉注意力实现基于注意力的特征表示。

Result: 在具有挑战性的基础设施检查数据集上，8-way 5-shot训练配置在2-way分类测试中达到82.55% F1分数和72.26% mIoU，自注意力方法带来最显著的性能提升，比基线提高2.57% F1分数和2.9% mIoU。

Conclusion: 该框架解决了基础设施检查系统中用有限新训练数据快速响应新缺陷类型的关键需求，为关键基础设施系统提供更高效和经济的维护方案。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [3] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的皮肤分割技术，用于改进远程光电容积描记(rPPG)技术，通过优先选择皮肤区域来增强信号质量，提高在运动、说话等挑战性条件下的心率监测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程光电容积描记(rPPG)技术对光照和运动敏感，现有方法在皮肤区域选择方面存在不足，需要改进皮肤分割技术来提高信号提取质量。

Method: 开发了一种新的皮肤分割技术，能够检测全身皮肤区域，同时去除可能造成干扰的口、眼、头发等区域，使系统对运动更具鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开数据集和新的SYNC-rPPG数据集上评估，模型在说话、头部旋转等挑战性条件下仍能准确捕捉心跳，保持预测心率与实际心率之间的平均绝对误差(MAE)，而其他方法无法做到。

Conclusion: 该技术对多种肤色具有高精度检测能力，在现实世界应用中表现出良好前景，特别是在运动干扰条件下保持心率监测的准确性。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [4] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAf是一个结合空间和光谱特征的混合架构自动对焦框架，可将传统显微镜转换为高效玻片扫描仪，减少80%对焦时间，在资源受限环境中实现实时数字病理学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全玻片成像扫描仪成本高昂，现有低成本解决方案存在对焦不一致、需要多张图像输入或缺乏跨组织类型泛化能力等问题。

Method: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳焦点的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 对焦精度达0.18μm，对焦时间比堆栈方法减少80%，在536个脑组织样本的临床研究中，4x放大倍率下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了全面的硬件-软件设计，在资源受限环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理学，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

best results, achieving 99.33% accuracy with consistently strong metrics for
individual classes, particularly excelling in identifying Cutting Weevil and
Bacterial Canker. Moreover, ResNet152V2 and SeResNet152 provided strong
outcomes, whereas InceptionV3 and Xception exhibited lower performance in
visually similar categories like Sooty Mould and Powdery Mildew. The training
and validation plots demonstrated stable convergence for the highest-performing
models. The capability of fine-tuned transfer learning models, for precise and

### [6] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Guidance方法，在生成时选择性锐化导致伪影的分数函数方向，减少扩散模型的结构不一致幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本位于真实数据分布支持之外。虽然语义插值有助于生成多样性，但需要更精细的解决方案来区分有害幻觉和有益变化。

Method: 引入Dynamic Guidance方法，通过仅沿已知导致伪影的预定方向选择性锐化分数函数来减轻幻觉，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: 在受控和自然图像数据集上，Dynamic Guidance显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉的方法，能有效平衡生成多样性和结构一致性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [7] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种训练免费的视频生成扩散模型加速方法，通过分析推理过程中的内存瓶颈，设计了三种阶段特定的策略来减少内存消耗，同时保持加速收益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的视频生成中，推理过程中的潜在冗余为加速提供了切入点，但现有的缓存加速方法在去噪和解码阶段会导致显著的内存激增。

Method: 将推理过程分解为编码、去噪和解码三个阶段，针对不同阶段特性提出：1）异步缓存交换 2）特征分块 3）切片潜在解码，确保额外时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时将质量下降控制在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: 提出的阶段特定策略有效解决了缓存加速方法的内存瓶颈问题，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [8] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像的时间反演重建框架，利用RGB和热图像对来恢复几秒前的场景状态，通过视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程实现语义和结构一致的重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像能捕捉人机交互留下的热残留痕迹，这些痕迹可作为被动时间编码，推断近期事件，超越RGB相机的能力。

Method: 将视觉语言模型与约束扩散过程结合，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三个受控场景中评估，证明可以重建120秒前的合理过去帧。

Conclusion: 这是从热痕迹进行时间反演成像的第一步，展示了从热残留恢复过去场景状态的可行性。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [9] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为pi-map的可训练映射网络，能够将对象实例的局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，结合自然语言查询实现CLIP风格的图像检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决使用复合查询检索图像的问题，即结合图像中的对象实例信息和自然语言描述来检索特定图像，例如检索"某人的头上戴着Fluffy独角兽"这样的图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络，将对象实例的局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，使得该标记与自然语言查询的组合适合CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。训练过程简单，每个对象实例只需训练一次。

Result: 在评估个性化检索的两个基准测试中，使用可训练的pi-map映射网络结合冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器，提高了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 提出的pi-map方法能够有效处理复合查询的图像检索任务，在个性化检索基准上取得了优于现有方法的表现。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [10] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节级别的3D高斯人头化身框架，通过2D UV特征空间参数化高斯点，实现无需重新训练即可动态调整渲染质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS化身使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节级别，限制了在平衡渲染效率和视觉质量方面的灵活性。

Method: 提出UV特征场，由多级可学习特征图组成，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图来控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节级别达到SOTA质量，最低细节级别仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%等），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练的连续细节级别控制，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率，为实际应用提供了灵活性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [11] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云视频的动作识别新方法，通过分割人体点云、跟踪个体和身体部位分割，结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上达到89.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着消费级深度传感器和激光雷达的普及，需要开发利用密集3D数据进行动作识别的第三种方法，以补充现有的骨骼动作识别和视频方法。

Method: 提出一个处理3D视频的流水线：分割人体点云、跟踪个体、身体部位分割。核心是结合点云技术和稀疏卷积网络的新型骨干网络，使用体素映射的点云序列，并整合表面法线、颜色、红外强度和身体部位标签等辅助特征。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优异，与现有骨骼动作识别算法竞争。通过融合传感器和估计深度输入的集成设置，在训练和测试使用不同人类受试者时达到89.3%的准确率，优于之前的点云动作识别方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D动作识别提供了有效的替代方案，证明了点云数据在动作识别任务中的潜力，特别是在结合多种深度输入源时能获得更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

### [12] [Be Tangential to Manifold: Discovering Riemannian Metric for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05509)
*Shinnosuke Saito,Takashi Matsubara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼度量的扩散模型插值方法，通过噪声空间的几何结构来更好地遵循数据流形，产生更自然和忠实的过渡效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间来参数化数据流形，限制了流形感知的分析和操作，现有插值方法通常遵循高密度区域路径，不一定与数据流形对齐，导致感知不自然的过渡。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的黎曼度量方法，基于分数函数雅可比矩阵捕获局部数据流形切空间的性质，在噪声空间中构造度量，使测地线保持在或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 在图像插值实验中，该方法比现有的基于密度和朴素基线方法产生感知上更自然和忠实的过渡效果。

Conclusion: 通过利用扩散模型学习的数据流形几何结构，提出的黎曼度量方法能够实现更符合数据内在结构的插值操作，为扩散模型的流形感知分析提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

### [13] [Seeing the Big Picture: Evaluating Multimodal LLMs' Ability to Interpret and Grade Handwritten Student Work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05538)
*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型在批改和分析学生手写数学作业方面的表现。实验A显示模型在客观算术题上达到接近人类的准确率(95%)，但实验B表明模型在需要视觉解释和教学判断的数学插图任务上表现较差，除非提供人类描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在基础教育中批改手写数学作业的潜力，特别是在需要理解学生解题过程和数学插图的场景中，以减轻教师批改负担。

Method: 设计两个实验：实验A使用加纳中学生288份手写算术作业评估模型对客观答案的识别能力；实验B使用美国小学生150份数学插图作业，分别测试模型直接分析图像和基于人类描述分析的能力。

Result: 实验A：模型在客观算术题上准确率达95%，与人类评分一致性k=0.90；实验B：模型直接分析插图时与真实评分一致性仅k=0.20，但基于人类描述分析时一致性提升至k=0.47，达到人类间一致性水平。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型能够较好地识别和批改手写算术作业，但在需要复杂视觉解释和教学判断的数学插图任务上仍存在局限，特别是在视觉理解方面。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

Conclusion: 该工作证明了通过潜在动态建模可以同时学习强视觉表示用于物体识别和运动理解，并通过前向特征扰动分析验证了学习动态能捕捉高层次对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建和场景理解方法在几何完整性、物体交互性、物理合理性、真实渲染或可靠动态仿真等方面存在不足，需要开发能够同时满足这些要求的解决方案。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，通过采样探索和梯度优化的混合方法进行高效优化，使用交互式场景图表示编码物体几何、外观、物理属性及层次关系。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，生成的数字孪生具有完整精确的几何结构、物理稳定性和新颖视角下的真实渲染效果。

Conclusion: HoloScene在交互式游戏和实时数字孪生操作等实际应用中展示了广泛的适用性和有效性，为物理世界的数字化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应来改进视觉语言模型在文本驱动图像检索任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在结构限制，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，主导信息聚合过程并抑制判别性特征。

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器(CVE)，将视觉特征解耦为目标和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间提出判别概念校准器(DCC)，区分文本查询中的通用和判别概念。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了视觉语言模型在文本驱动图像检索中的性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少视觉思维链中的冗余，在保持图像质量的同时将推理提示长度减少54%，提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型使用思维链推理来增强图像生成的对齐度和细节，但这种方法会产生不必要的冗余（视觉过度思考），增加计算成本并可能引入与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，使用自适应奖励函数鼓励更简洁的思维链，并将该奖励整合到强化学习范式中，根据任务难度进行缩放。

Result: 在多个基准测试（T2I-CompBench、GenEval）上，推理提示长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提高质量指标。定性分析显示消除了冗长解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下提高了计算效率，产生既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: 提出了HOI-R1方法，首次探索语言模型在无需额外检测模块的情况下解决人-物交互检测任务，通过强化学习和HOI奖励函数实现纯文本推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOID方法过度依赖VLM先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂，而MLLM在人-物交互检测中的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，使用强化学习方法训练MLLM，通过纯文本方式解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到了基线方法2倍的准确率，并展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型能够在不依赖额外检测模块的情况下有效解决HOID任务，为简化HOID框架提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Motivation: 当前自回归模型在复杂空间条件生成时需要微调预训练模型，导致高昂的训练成本。

Method: 提出轻量级控制模块，采用分布式架构包含上下文感知注意力层和共享门控前馈网络，并引入早期中心采样策略和温度调度。

Result: 在基于尺度的自回归模型上验证，实现了高保真度和多样化的图像生成控制，超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECM框架在保持生成质量的同时，显著提升了训练和推理效率，为复杂条件生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP是一个从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归方法在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，首次在自回归范式中实现了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法由于在无序点集上强加人工排序，导致模型过度关注局部连续性而忽视全局结构特性（如对称性、拓扑一致性等），性能长期落后于扩散方法。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，采用从粗到细的生成策略，在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步细化高尺度下的精细几何，实现多尺度分解。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到最先进的生成质量，在参数、训练和推理效率上超越强扩散基线，在8192点密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解将自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，避免了脆弱的固定排序，展示了自回归点云生成的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个端到端的地理空间AI框架，通过自动化数据管道和模型蒸馏技术，将大型地理空间基础模型转化为紧凑、高效的可部署工具，显著减小模型尺寸和碳排放。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 集成三个核心组件：(1)自动化数据整理，将原始卫星图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2)任务特定的模型蒸馏，生成紧凑的计算高效模型；(3)无缝部署为交互式网络地图应用。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署流程，将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Conclusion: 这项工作挑战了关于频谱峰值在合成图像检测中重要性的普遍假设，为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于自动诊断眼源性异常头位姿势，以及基于课程学习的插补框架处理缺失数据，在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位姿势(AHP)是斜视等眼部错位疾病的代偿机制，早期诊断很重要但当前临床评估主观且受不完整医疗记录影响。

Method: AHP-CADNet是多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿势特征和结构化临床属性；课程学习插补框架逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R2超过0.93；插补框架在所有临床变量上保持93.46-99.78%准确率。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和缺失数据恢复都有效，证实了其在实际数据条件下的诊断稳健性。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system

TL;DR: SD-MVSum扩展了基于脚本的视频摘要方法，通过加权跨模态注意力机制同时考虑脚本与视频视觉内容和语音文本的关联性，提升了与用户提供脚本最相关视频片段的提取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于脚本的视频摘要方法仅考虑视频的视觉内容，忽略了语音文本的重要性。为了更全面地理解视频内容与用户脚本的关联，需要同时考虑视觉和语音两种模态。

Method: 提出SD-MVSum方法，使用加权跨模态注意力机制建模脚本-视频和脚本-转录两种模态对之间的依赖关系，利用语义相似性来促进与用户脚本最相关的视频片段选择。

Result: 实验结果表明SD-MVSum在脚本驱动和通用视频摘要任务中具有竞争力，优于其他最先进方法。同时扩展了两个大规模视频摘要数据集S-VideoXum和MrHiSum。

Conclusion: SD-MVSum通过整合视觉和语音模态，有效提升了脚本驱动视频摘要的性能，为多模态视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

TL;DR: ARGUS提出了一种新的肝癌组织学分型方法，通过捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，结合几何特征和分层视野对齐，实现了最先进的肝癌分型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝细胞癌和肝内胆管癌是消化系统中最具异质性的癌症，其全切片图像包含丰富的层次结构、肿瘤微环境和几何表示信息，但现有方法未能充分利用这些关键特征，导致分型性能受限。

Method: ARGUS方法包括：1）构建微观几何特征表示细胞级模式；2）设计分层视野对齐模块建模宏观和中观层次交互；3）通过几何先验引导融合策略整合特征进行整体表型交互建模。

Result: 在公共和私有队列上的广泛实验表明，ARGUS在肝癌组织学分型中达到了最先进的性能，为临床实践提供了有效的诊断工具。

Conclusion: ARGUS通过有效利用全切片图像中的多层次信息，显著提升了肝癌组织学分型的准确性和可靠性，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

*Jialu Gao,K J Joseph,Fernando De La Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的管道，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入背景场景，实现真实的人物放置和高质量个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物放置和个性化视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖训练才能达到高性能。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导实现全局编辑，通过掩码引导的自注意力机制确保高质量个性化，仅需单张参考图像即可保持人物身份、服装和身体特征。

Result: 在多样化复合场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和主体身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需特定任务训练即可实现真实的人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于古典音乐会多摄像机录像自动编辑的多模态架构，将问题分解为"何时剪辑"和"如何剪辑"两个子任务，在剪辑点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍是一个未被充分探索的任务，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专门针对古典音乐会多摄像机录像的编辑挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道整合音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征进行时间分割；使用CLIP编码器更新空间选择，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会的片段中。

Result: 模型在检测剪辑点方面优于先前基线，并在视觉镜头选择方面提供了有竞争力的结果，推进了多模态自动化视频编辑的技术水平。

Conclusion: 该工作通过分解编辑问题并提出新颖的多模态架构，在自动化视频编辑领域取得了进展，特别是在古典音乐会多摄像机录像的编辑任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Motivation: 研究立枯丝核菌对莴苣种子萌发和早期发育的影响，并开发一种非破坏性、可扩展的表型分析方法，以克服传统图像分析在幼苗重叠情况下的局限性。

Method: 使用低成本多摄像头系统连续采集感染组和对照组的萌发过程图像，开发了整合形态和空间特征的新型图像分析流程，采用时空整合方法分析幼苗发育动态。

Result: 立枯丝核菌感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在复杂生长条件下实现了高精度幼苗计数，决定系数达0.98，均方根误差为1.12，特别在后期传统分割技术失效时表现优异。

Conclusion: 成功验证了低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合进行非破坏性表型分析的可行性，时空整合方法在复杂条件下实现了可靠的幼苗识别和计数，为植物病理学研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过将视觉对象作为视觉等价于语言中的单词，设计语义接地目标来提升视觉模型的推理和上下文学习能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习方面落后于语言模型，这可能源于视觉变换器训练方案中缺乏语义和上下文指导。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模框架，对视觉对象而非随机图像块进行掩码，推动模型学习视觉元素间的全局上下文和语义关系。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径在没有对象级表示时往往被学习。多模态大语言模型在视觉问答任务上表现出更强的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够显著提升视觉模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时，难以准确控制年龄同时保持身份，且微调需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 引入年龄条件提示融合和基于SVDMix的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，利用衰老的线性特性减少对大量年龄标注数据的依赖。

Result: AgeBooth能够从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的逼真且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量上优于现有最先进的编辑方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需昂贵年龄变化数据集的有效年龄控制解决方案，实现了高质量的中间年龄肖像生成。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动标注，显著提升下游任务性能，为数据增强提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Method: 提出FusionDetect方法，利用CLIP和Dinov2两个冻结基础模型的互补特征，构建统一的特征空间来适应生成器内容和设计的变化。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准测试中比最接近的竞争对手准确率提高3.87%，平均精度提高6.13%，在OmniGen基准上准确率提高4.48%，并对常见图像扰动具有优异鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还引入了新的基准测试和框架，为通用AI图像检测的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到最先进性能，mAP达到50.95%，甚至超越了使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法（48.42%）。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了完全无监督的LiDAR实例分割是可行的，且性能可超越某些有监督方法，为降低标注成本提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径，证明该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效利用不可靠标签数据源，通过考虑数据源可靠性的加权训练策略，显著提升了深度网络在遥感图像场景分类中的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为整体编码器，仅依赖最终层表示进行检测。本文挑战这一做法，探索中间层在检测分布偏移方面的潜力。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则自动识别在训练自由设置下提供最具互补信息的中间层，无需访问OOD数据，选择性地整合这些中间表示。

Result: 在远OOD基准测试中检测准确率提升高达10%，在近OOD基准测试中提升超过7%，优于现有训练自由方法，适用于各种模型架构和训练目标。

Conclusion: 揭示了OOD检测研究的新途径，并展示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

*Yi-Hsin Li,Thomas Sikora,Sebastian Knorr,Mårten Sjöström*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了基于栅格化的优化策略，将栅格化高斯核渲染的效率与Steered Mixture of Experts的边缘感知门控机制相结合，加速二维图像回归任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts回归框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现优异，但计算成本高限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用栅格化优化策略替代全局迭代优化，结合栅格化高斯核渲染和边缘感知门控机制，实现更快的参数更新和内存效率更高的模型表示。

Result: 方法显著加速了参数更新，提供了更高效的模型表示，并支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪等应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和重建保真度之间提供了新的平衡，适用于二维图像处理任务。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种自监督深度学习方法，用于在心脏磁共振短轴和四腔心长轴图像中检测五个关键帧，相比传统基于体积的方法显著提高了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室体积曲线推导收缩末期和舒张末期帧，无法深入了解心肌运动模式。需要更准确的关键帧检测来消除个体心动周期差异对时间比较和子相位分析的影响。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，首先从图像中推导密集可变形配准场，计算一维运动描述符来捕捉心脏收缩和舒张模式，然后基于特征曲线使用简单规则确定关键帧。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的评估显示，该方法在短轴和长轴视图上的ED和ES检测精度分别提高了30%-51%和11%-47%，所有五个关键帧的平均循环帧差异低于1.31帧（短轴）和1.73帧（长轴）。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现与心动周期或相位长度无关的时间对齐患者间和患者内心脏动力学分析，为心脏功能评估提供了更深入的见解。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

### [42] [Flow4Agent: Long-form Video Understanding via Motion Prior from Optical Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05836)
*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个利用光流运动先验来增强LLM长视频理解的新框架，通过时间粒度优化和运动token剪枝来减少视频冗余，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时间和空间内容冗余的挑战，而多模态大语言模型的上下文长度有限。现有方法依赖CLIP模型作为语义先验提取关键信息，但忽略了运动信息的重要性。

Method: 提出Flow4Agent框架，包含两个核心模块：时间粒度优化(TGO)利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；运动token剪枝(MTP)利用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频token。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME达到64.7%，MLVU达到71.4%，LongVideoBench达到60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入光流运动先验有效解决了长视频冗余问题，在长视频理解任务上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一个基于多模态数据和神经架构搜索的昆虫分类模型，在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上达到96.81%准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用图像和元数据等多模态数据，应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个单元内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双级优化训练策略和零操作剪枝。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上获得96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数，分别比现有方法提升约16%、10%和8%；在Insects-1M数据集上获得93.25%准确率。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成方面取得突破，但给合成图像检测带来新挑战。与GAN或扩散模型不同，AR模型通过离散令牌预测生成图像，具有独特的向量量化表示特征。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D3QE)方法，集成动态码本频率统计到注意力机制中，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Result: 在涵盖7种主流视觉AR模型的ARForensics数据集上实验，D3QE展现出优越的检测精度和强泛化能力，对真实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D3QE方法能有效检测自回归生成的图像，利用AR模型特有的码本频率分布偏差和量化误差模式，为合成图像检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出弱监督上下文学习(WS-ICL)，使用弱提示(如边界框或点)替代密集标签，显著降低医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用医学图像分割模型(交互式和上下文学习模型)虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要为每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签，标注成本高。

Method: 提出WS-ICL新范式，利用弱提示(边界框或点)作为上下文，无需精细掩码和所有图像的重复用户提示，大幅减少标注工作量。

Result: 在三个保留基准测试中，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的情况下，实现了与常规ICL模型相当的性能，并且在交互范式下也具有高度竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是朝着更高效、统一的医学图像分割通用模型迈出的有希望的一步，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于物流场景缺陷检测的大规模数据集，该数据集包含超过23万张图像和2.9万个缺陷实例，是MVTec-AD的40倍大，包含超过4.8万个不同对象。现有最先进的异常检测方法在该数据集上表现不佳，最高仅达到56.96% AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工业异常检测数据集（如MVTec-AD和VisA）主要关注制造场景，具有高度控制的姿态和有限的对象类别，且已达到饱和状态。而零售物流中的异常检测面临新的挑战，特别是对象姿态和外观的多样性和变异性。

Method: 构建了一个大规模数据集，包含超过230,000张图像和29,000个缺陷实例，涵盖48,000个不同对象。通过广泛的评估验证了现有最先进异常检测方法在该数据集上的表现。

Result: 现有最先进的异常检测方法在该数据集上的表现不佳，最高AUROC仅为56.96%。定性分析证实现有方法难以在姿态和外观变化剧烈的情况下有效利用正常样本。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了新的基准，鼓励未来研究解决这一具有挑战性的问题。数据集已公开提供下载。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面分析了医学影像中的token mixer设计，在MetaFormer架构下系统评估了池化、卷积和注意力机制在图像分类和语义分割任务中的表现，发现分类任务适合低复杂度token mixer，而分割任务需要卷积的局部归纳偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然MetaFormer架构在计算机视觉中表现出色，但在医学影像领域的研究仍然稀缺，且缺乏不同token mixer的对比分析，可能忽略了更适合医学影像的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三种token mixer，在8个医学影像数据集上进行图像分类和语义分割评估，并研究从自然图像预训练权重的迁移效果。

Result: 对于分类任务，低复杂度的token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）已足够；预训练权重在领域差异下仍然有效。对于分割任务，卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积在减少运行时间和参数的同时表现最佳。

Conclusion: 医学影像任务需要针对性的token mixer设计：分类任务适合简单设计，分割任务需要卷积的局部特性，分组卷积是平衡效率和性能的最佳选择。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态成分分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，无法适应视频场景内容变化的动态特性，需要开发数据驱动的自适应字典学习方法。

Method: 扩展MCA算法，引入动态模态分解特征值聚类技术，从数据中学习自适应字典，形成DMCA方法。通过特征值聚类识别视频中的不同动态模式。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA在视频去噪中的有效性，成功提升了微弱目标在海洋背景下的信噪比，并在逆合成孔径雷达图像中分离了自行车和风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的字典学习方法，能够有效适应视频内容的动态变化，在多个应用场景中展现出优于传统MCA的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Motivation: 随着基于扩散的图像生成和编辑技术的兴起，这些强大技术对现有鲁棒水印方案构成了新的威胁，需要研究扩散模型如何影响水印的生存能力。

Method: 提出扩散驱动的图像再生过程来擦除嵌入水印，并引入一种新颖的引导扩散攻击，在生成过程中明确针对水印信号，显著降低水印可检测性。

Result: 在多个最先进水印方案（包括StegaStamp、TrustMark和VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，强调了在生成AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Motivation: 利用社交媒体图像补充传统冰雹传感器，实现更快速、更详细的恶劣天气评估。

Method: 使用474张奥地利冰雹事件图像，比较四种模型的一阶段和两阶段提示策略，后者利用图像中的参考对象（如人手）作为尺寸线索。

Result: 预训练模型无需微调即可从图像中测量冰雹直径，最佳模型平均绝对误差1.12cm，两阶段提示提高大多数模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现成模型可从社交媒体图像中提取有意义的信息，补充传统传感器，实时图像采集是未来应用的关键挑战。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习环境中生成准确连贯的图像描述面临灾难性遗忘和视觉概念与语言对齐的挑战。

Method: 基于预训练的ViT-GPT-2架构，结合交叉熵损失与三个额外组件：基于提示的余弦相似度损失、CLIP风格损失和语言引导的对比损失。

Result: 该方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，在语义描述对齐方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多损失框架在持续图像描述任务中表现出色，无需推理时额外开销即可实现更好的语义对齐。

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通用实例搜索模型在犯罪调查中能大幅减少人工分析监控录像的工作量，但研究发现这些模型存在意外涌现能力：即使在没有人类主体的数据集上训练，也能通过过度学习识别特定个体，引发隐私担忧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决通用实例搜索模型意外获得的个人识别能力所带来的隐私风险，目前缺乏明确的去标识化标准。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验测试这些方法在限制人员重识别能力方面的效果。

Result: 结合这两种方法可以将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题，包括如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统，以及需要哪些技术标准来防止良性应用中出现识别能力。

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

analyzing existing architectures in a common framework. We also propose a new
search algorithm that allows traversing the proposed search space, and
demonstrate that the space contains interesting architectures, which, when
using identical training setup, outperform state-of-the-art hand-crafted
architectures. Finally, a unified toolkit including a standardized training and
evaluation protocol is introduced to foster reproducibility and enable fair
comparison in NAS research. Overall, this work opens a pathway towards
systematically exploring the full spectrum of neural architectures with a
unified graph-based NAS perspective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1)如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2)如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确定位关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner系统，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，并引入T-GRPO（基于树的组相对策略优化）强化学习方法指导关键帧探索。

Result: 在所有长视频理解任务中取得优越性能，T-GRPO意外地激励模型自发生成推理链，树生长辅助素动态调整扩展深度，获得准确性和效率提升。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO方法有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，为多模态大语言模型的视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D形变模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵，需要一种既能保持高质量又能高效计算的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，整合逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，采用相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视图设置中达到最先进性能，在多视图场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性强的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，为3D人脸重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

TL;DR: 将医学领域专用视觉语言模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，显著提升了基于视觉观察的机器人腹腔镜手术任务的性能，在五个不同任务环境中成功率超过70%，相比基线有66.67%到1114.29%的改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临的挑战：高维视觉输入、奖励稀疏性以及从原始视觉数据中提取任务相关特征的困难。

Method: 集成MedFlamingo（医学领域专用视觉语言模型）与PPO，每个episode处理一次任务观察和指令以生成高级规划token，将医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈高效结合。

Result: 在LapGym的五个腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO优于并比标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO收敛更快，所有环境任务成功率超过70%，相比基线改进幅度为66.67%到1114.29%。

Conclusion: 医学专业知识在机器人手术规划和决策中具有重要价值，MedFlamingo PPO方法有效结合了领域知识与强化学习，提升了手术任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

TL;DR: CAPTCHA被用作评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准，研究发现逐步推理对解决高难度空间推理任务至关重要，现有商业模型表现不佳（准确率约21.9%）。作者提出CAPTCHA-X基准和基于推理的VLM框架，将准确率提升至83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA作为区分人类与机器人的工具，已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的现实基准。研究发现当前商业VLMs在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要探索如何通过推理能力提升模型性能。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准，包含7类CAPTCHA的逐步推理解决方案和标注；定义5个推理导向的评估指标；提出基于代理VLM的通用框架，利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到最先进性能，平均解决准确率为83.9%，显著超越现有基线方法（商业模型准确率约21.9%）。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前模型的局限性，强调了推理能力在推进视觉空间挑战中的重要性，为未来视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，通过去除噪声模式产生更清晰的注意力图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的ViT解释方法依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为注意力捕获的是每层内token-to-token的交互。需要一种能过滤噪声并保持注意力可解释性的方法。

Method: 将注意力图与统计过滤（最初为CNN设计）相结合，去除噪声或无信息模式，并扩展为类别特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估显示，该方法产生更清晰、更可解释的注意力图，在扰动忠实度指标和人类注视数据对齐方面优于或与SOTA方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高效和人类可理解的同时，为ViT提供了更忠实的解释，强调了人类可解释性在XAI中的重要性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Motivation: 尽管有TotalSegmentator等先进分割框架，但左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的准确分割在医学影像中仍是重大挑战，需要高质量数据集来支持相关研究。

Method: 使用专门为高分辨率左心耳分割开发的最先进分割框架，在带有医学读者手动标注的大型私有数据集上训练网络，然后将模型迁移到ImageCAS数据；冠状动脉标签从原始ImageCAS标注改进，肺静脉分割从TS输出细化。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Motivation: 现有基于张量的高光谱图像超分辨率方法通常只能有效利用一个或两个先验，难以同时整合多级先验，因为这会增加模型复杂性并带来权重平衡和多块结构优化的挑战。

Method: 使用块项分解将潜在高空间-光谱分辨率图像分解为光谱子空间和空间映射；将空间映射堆叠为空间张量，通过非凸模式混洗张量相关总变分共同建模高阶空间低秩性和平滑性先验；基于线性化交替方向乘子法设计高效优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了所提算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多级先验，并通过理论证明在温和条件下具有KKT收敛性。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，降低了在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽略了肿瘤的全局背景和与基因组数据的语义对齐。

Method: 建立统一特征原型空间整合WSI全局局部特征和基因组数据；开发稳健表型表示融合关键斑块与全局背景；采用指数原型更新策略维持跨模态关联；设计分层原型匹配方案捕捉全局中心性、局部典型性和队列趋势。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在准确性和互操作性方面均优于当前领先的单模态和多模态生存预测技术。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用的原型学习提供了新视角，通过多模态整合和分层原型匹配实现了更准确和可解释的癌症生存预测。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is

Motivation: 医学影像中的深度学习常受限于稀缺且不平衡的标注数据，需要有效的方法来缓解标注瓶颈并提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3生成图像扩展训练数据，并通过迭代半监督伪标签方法精炼标签，作为现有基线的增强框架而非独立模型。

Conclusion: SSGNet是缓解医学图像分析中标注瓶颈、提高鲁棒性的实用策略。

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation

Motivation: 现有生成式医学模型受限于特定模态场景，无法整合影像、病理和临床笔记的互补证据，限制了其发展成为能够跨生物医学数据学习的基座模型。

Result: 实现高质量医学生成（MIMIC-CXR上FID 16.60，PathGen上FID 24.19）和准确报告生成（METEOR 0.2650和0.2580），联合生成的图像-报告对显著提升下游性能。

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，为医学领域的跨模态生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

TL;DR: FlowRVS将参考视频对象分割重新定义为条件连续流问题，通过语言引导的变形从视频整体表示直接生成目标掩码，在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用'定位-分割'的级联设计存在信息瓶颈，将语义简化为粗粒度几何提示，且分割过程与初始语言定位解耦导致时间一致性差。

Method: 提出FlowRVS框架，利用预训练T2V模型的优势，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形，实现单阶段生成方法。

Result: 在所有主要RVOS基准测试中达到新的SOTA：MeViS上J&F为51.1（比之前SOTA提高1.6），零样本Ref-DAVIS17上为73.3（提高2.7）。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS通过直接变形方法克服了级联设计的局限性。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频条件4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视图一致的外观，但现有方法存在鲁棒性和时间一致性问题

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，以增强时间稳定性

Result: 在多样化野外视频中，该方法相比基线提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式

Conclusion: 该框架能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化和拓扑转换，为视频到4D形状生成提供了有效的端到端解决方案

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型难以融入精细的相机元数据（如光圈设置），无法生成可控的镜头模糊效果。

Method: 首先生成全对焦图像，估计单目深度，使用新型焦点距离变换器预测合理对焦距离，然后通过可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像，整个流程支持梯度反向传播。

Result: 实验结果表明该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现精细的散焦控制，优于现有扩散模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合相机元数据和物理成像过程，实现了对镜头模糊效果的精确交互控制，填补了现有扩散模型的空白。

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，无需深度传感器即可达到RGB-D级别的精度，通过三个预训练视觉模块替代主动深度输入，在动态环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发不依赖深度传感器的SLAM系统，利用现代预训练视觉模型提供度量尺度信息，实现更简单、成本更低的SLAM解决方案。

Method: 使用三个预训练模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络；通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态对象，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影为3D特征，由未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，性能达到或超过最先进的RGB-D方法，在单GPU上以22 FPS运行。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，为更简单、成本更低的SLAM系统迈出重要一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: EgoNight是首个针对夜间第一人称视觉的综合基准测试，以视觉问答为核心任务，包含3658个QA对和90个视频，揭示了现有模型在低光照条件下的性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有第一人称视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 收集合成和真实世界的昼夜对齐视频，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日间增强的夜间自动标注引擎，并通过大量人工验证进行精炼。

Result: 评估最先进的多模态大语言模型显示，从白天到夜间的迁移性能大幅下降，突显了低光照条件下推理的挑战。

Conclusion: EgoNight为推进应用驱动的第一人称视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代接触感知优化和繁重依赖（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM预处理）的问题，实现更高效的一体化重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，使用参数高效的视觉提示调优，在保持丰富时空先验的同时直接读取多个SMPL-X身体，实现单次前向传播的联合重建。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上仅训练一天，即实现实时速度（15 FPS）、低内存占用（8 GB）的多人人体和3D场景重建，在多项任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R提供了一个简单而强大的基准，可轻松扩展到下游应用，有望推动4D人体-场景重建领域的发展。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

Conclusion: 所提出的基于信息状态的方法能够有效管理任务导向对话，通过中间信息增强规划能力，在对话性能上取得显著改进。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

Motivation: 现有的机器翻译评估方法对英语和欧洲语言有效，但不适用于印度语言，因此需要为古吉拉特语开发专门的评估指标。

Method: 使用监督学习方法，基于25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（6隐藏层和10隐藏层，各500轮训练），收集了7个MT系统的1000个输出与人工参考翻译进行比较。

Result: 开发的评估指标在与其他可用指标比较时，显示出更好的人工相关性。

Conclusion: 成功为古吉拉特语开发了有效的机器翻译评估指标，解决了现有方法对印度语言不适用的问题。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

Motivation: 现有研究要么将幻觉视为需要最小化的工程缺陷，要么论证其理论必然性，但都未能充分考虑实现通用人工智能所需的条件。

Method: 基于封闭世界和开放世界假设，开发了幻觉的分类方法，区分可纠正和不可避免的幻觉类型。

Result: 在封闭世界假设下幻觉可能被缓解，但在开放世界假设下幻觉变得不可避免，这是LLM泛化能力的体现。

Conclusion: 幻觉不应仅仅被视为工程缺陷，而应作为与人类智能兼容的结构性特征来对待和管理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据增强和合成语料构建，但忽视了支撑有效情感支持的深层认知推理过程。

Method: 利用原始ESC训练集引导模型生成逻辑连贯的支持性回应，并采用强化学习来细化和强化推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明CARE显著提升了回应的逻辑合理性和支持质量。

Conclusion: CARE推动了具有同理心、认知鲁棒性和类人特性的情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

TL;DR: MADS是一个通过智能体自博弈生成说服性多轮对话的可扩展框架，包含用户智能体、对话智能体和优化智能体，无需人工标注即可生成训练数据，在真实营销场景中将小模型的有机流量转化率提升了22.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，实现低成本训练数据生成。

Method: 采用三个协调智能体：模拟多样化人物行为的用户智能体、执行任务导向说服策略的对话智能体、评估优化对话结果的优化智能体，并通过用户态度链建模和专用LLM说服力评估进行验证。

Result: 在真实营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小LLM的说服能力，将有机流量转化率从1.83%提高到2.24%，提升了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效解决数据稀缺问题，提升模型说服能力，具有明确的商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

TL;DR: IDIOMoE模型通过将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的原生方言，在预训练LLM中分离文本专家和物品专家，实现了协同过滤信号与自然语言的统一理解，在保持文本理解能力的同时提升推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和LLM的表达推理能力，满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的期望，但协同信号语义不透明而LLM难以建模隐式用户偏好。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块中将前馈网络分离为文本专家和物品专家，通过token类型门控避免模态间破坏性干扰，将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的方言。

Result: 在公共和专有数据集上展示了强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE成功统一了协同过滤和LLM的优势，为推荐系统提供了既高效又表达丰富的解决方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改进LLM的不确定性表达能力，但不同元认知技能需要多任务训练才能共同提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在决策场景中应用日益广泛，但缺乏有效的不确定性信号会导致用户误信错误输出。虽然LLM内部存在不确定性信号，但其显性表达的置信度通常校准不佳且难以区分答案正确性。

Method: 在通用知识、数学和开放式问答数据集上对两种LLM进行监督微调，评估两种元认知任务：单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较，并测试在医学和法律推理等未见领域的泛化能力。

Result: 微调改善了校准（置信度与准确性的对齐）和区分度（正确回答的置信度高于错误回答），同时保持准确性不变。但改进具有任务特异性，多任务微调在跨域评估中产生更广泛的增益。

Conclusion: LLM的不确定性表达能力是可训练且可泛化的，但不同的元认知技能不会自然相互强化，必须通过多任务训练共同发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

TL;DR: 提出基于BERT的自动化方法，用于从图片描述中提取和排序内容信息单元(CIUs)，以评估认知语言障碍，相比传统方法更高效准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估认知语言障碍的图片描述方法忽略了视觉叙事路径（描述元素的顺序和位置），而现有分析方法需要手动标注或基于字典的映射，工作量大。

Method: 使用基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，从Cookie Theft图片描述中自动提取和排序CIUs。

Result: 5折交叉验证显示：CIU检测中位数精度93%，中位数召回率96%，序列错误率24%。提取的特征与真实值有强相关性，在外部验证中优于基于字典的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

Motivation: 在大规模评估中，项目与内容标准的准确对齐对于分数解释的有效性至关重要。

Method: 1) 提取嵌入向量并训练经典监督机器学习模型，研究降维对性能的影响；2) 微调8个BERT模型及其变体用于领域和技能对齐；3) 探索多数投票和堆叠元模型的集成学习。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐上获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐上获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未能超越最佳语言模型，降维提升了基于嵌入向量的线性分类器但不如语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动化项目与内容标准对齐的不同方法，语言模型在两种对齐任务中都表现出色。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

TL;DR: Sub-CP是一个基于子模优化的块感知上下文选择框架，通过控制块多样性来解决ICL中信息冗余和欠表示问题，支持从全局多样性到局部一致性的灵活选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法在处理长上下文时通常将上下文分块处理，但忽略了不同分块策略导致的信息冗余或欠表示问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Sub-CP框架，利用子模目标函数来控制块的多样性，支持灵活的块选择策略，允许每个块在全局多样性和局部一致性之间调节，同时支持预计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同模型规模下都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP通过细粒度控制语义结构，有效解决了ICL中的上下文选择问题，显著提升了few-shot学习性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

TL;DR: 为解决Head Start项目中GoEngage平台新员工难以找到合适任务模块的问题，提出了结合轻量级拼写容错检索、向量相似度和LLM重排序的混合语义搜索系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新员工和轮岗员工在GoEngage平台主页上难以定位合适的任务模块，主要由于领域特定术语、系统特定命名以及词汇搜索在处理拼写错误和词序变化方面的局限性。

Method: 采用混合语义搜索方法，结合轻量级拼写容错检索、基于嵌入的向量相似度和约束性大语言模型重排序，利用现有任务库和知识库基础设施。

Result: 提供了完整的实施框架，包括所需资源、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议和在线测量方法，确保系统的可信性、可演进性和经济效率。

Conclusion: 该混合语义搜索系统能有效解决员工在GoEngage平台上的任务查找困难，同时保持低误报率、适应术语变化，并通过智能缓存和优雅降级机制实现经济高效。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过集合式全局损失和自监督二分匹配来保持推理路径多样性，在并行推理中优于传统SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通过扩展并行测试时计算提升性能，但需要生成既多样又准确的推理路径。传统方法如温度缩放难以平衡多样性和准确性，因为触发多样推理模式的分叉标记通常位于采样树深处。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合式下一个标记预测问题，在监督微调中引入基于集合的全局损失，使用自监督二分匹配将全局分叉标记与唯一推理轨迹进行匹配。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SSFT在Pass@1和Cons@k指标下始终优于传统SFT方法，能够保持推理模式的多样性。

Conclusion: SSFT方法有效解决了并行推理中多样性与准确性的权衡问题，通过保持推理路径多样性提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过控制实验研究了不同比例合成数据对模型性能的影响，发现在合成数据比例不超过20%时模型性能保持稳定，超过30%时性能加速下降，大模型比小模型对合成数据更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然合成数据在现代NLP训练中被广泛应用，但系统性地理解合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型的行为仍然有限，需要实证研究来指导实践。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同任务上进行实验，评估模型在1-3次训练迭代中，合成数据比例从0-50%时的表现。

Result: 模型在合成数据比例达20%时性能稳定，超过30%时加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）更具鲁棒性；校准退化先于准确率损失；推理任务比检索任务在合成数据训练下退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持超过80%外部数据）处于安全范围内，研究为从业者提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据预算实用指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

Motivation: 现代大语言模型在客观任务上表现出色，但在评估创意等主观任务时表现不佳，需要能够个性化学习不同个体的创造性判断。

Method: 使用好奇心驱动的LLM作为评估者，在Torrance创造性思维测试基准上学习不同个体的创造性判断，包括原创性等主观维度。

Result: 该方法使不同规模的模型都能学习个体的创造性判断，在皮尔逊相关性、Cohen's和F1值等指标上优于基线监督微调方法，特别适用于标注者意见不一致的主观评估场景。

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动的LLM评估方法能够有效学习个性化的创造性判断，在主观评估任务中表现优异，尤其适合标注者意见分歧的情况。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDetective是一个多跳深度搜索基准测试，解决了现有评估方法的两大局限：问题文本泄露推理路径和单一通过率评估。它提供无提示问题和可控维基百科沙盒，通过分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为来全面评估模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统和网络代理在多跳深度搜索任务评估中存在两个主要问题：基准测试在问题文本中泄露推理路径，导致模型依赖表面线索而非自主发现推理链；评估简化为单一通过率，无法区分失败的具体原因（搜索不足、知识使用不当或不恰当拒绝）。

Method: 开发WebDetective基准测试，包含无提示多跳问题和可控维基百科沙盒，确保模型行为的完全可追溯性。建立整体评估框架，分离评估搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为。评估25个最先进模型，并开发EvidenceLoop代理工作流程来应对发现的挑战。

Result: 评估显示所有架构模型都存在系统性弱点：即使有足够证据，模型在知识利用方面仍表现不佳；当证据不足时，几乎不会适当拒绝。这些模式揭示了根本差距：当前系统擅长执行给定推理路径，但在需要自主发现推理路径时表现失败。

Conclusion: WebDetective的诊断框架能够指导具体的架构改进，EvidenceLoop基线证明了这一点。该基准测试是开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理的关键工具，有助于解决当前系统在推理路径发现方面的根本缺陷。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

Conclusion: NLD-LLM框架有效评估语言模型的NLD能力，提示工程对模型性能至关重要

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

### [94] [To model human linguistic prediction, make LLMs less superhuman](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05141)
*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

TL;DR: Error

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取流水线，从实验报告材料中提取47个组成-加工-微观结构-性能特征，通过迭代提取和来源追踪提高准确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决材料发现中大量信息被困在非结构化文献中的问题，现有提取方法通常只关注有限特征集，未能整合理解材料行为所需的关键关系。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取流水线，集成迭代提取和来源追踪机制，专门从实验报告材料中提取组成、加工、微观结构和性能特征。

Result: 特征级和元组级F1分数均达到约0.96，微观结构类别F1分数分别提高10.0%和13.7%，在396种材料中漏检率从12.4%降至3.3%。

Conclusion: 该流水线能够实现可扩展和高效的文献挖掘，生成高精度、低遗漏和零误报的数据库，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可信输入。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

TL;DR: 提出了SynCED-EnDe数据集，这是一个用于机器翻译关键错误检测的新资源，包含1000个黄金标注和8000个白银标注的句子对，平衡了错误和非错误案例，具有更丰富的标注维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WMT21英德CED数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面存在局限性，需要更全面和平衡的数据集来推进机器翻译安全部署。

Method: 构建了SynCED-EnDe数据集，从2024-2025年的多样化来源收集数据，引入显式错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度辅助判断，包括明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性和充分性偏差。

Result: 使用XLM-R和相关编码器的基准实验显示，由于平衡标签和精细化标注，性能相比WMT21有显著提升。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe可作为社区资源，推进机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手等应用中的安全部署，特别是在可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景中。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)解码轨迹的模型归属方法，通过定向解码图(DDM)提取结构信息，并使用高斯轨迹归属(GTA)进行模型识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs的解码机制不仅能提升模型效用，还可作为模型归属的强大工具。挑战在于归属场景的多样性，包括区分不同模型及同一模型的不同检查点。

Method: 提出定向解码图(DDM)来捕捉解码步骤间的结构关系，避免直接使用模型置信度的冗余问题；然后使用高斯轨迹归属(GTA)方法，为每个目标模型在每个解码位置拟合高斯分布，通过轨迹似然度进行归属判断。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: dLLMs的解码轨迹可有效用于模型归属，DDM和GTA方法能够准确识别模型来源，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

TL;DR: 提出了时序思考机制，一种用于全双工语音对话模型的实时思考方法，在倾听用户语音时进行轻量级推理，提高响应质量而不增加延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工语音对话系统在倾听阶段只是重复预测静默标记，这与人类在对话中持续思考的行为不符。受人类对话行为的启发，希望让AI代理在倾听时也能进行轻量级思考。

Method: 时序思考机制：1）严格因果性：在倾听时增量推理，仅基于过去音频更新内部假设；2）无额外延迟：在倾听窗口内分摊推理时间，用户停止说话后立即开始响应。

Result: 实验通过客观指标和人工评估显示，时序思考在响应质量上带来一致改进，并能稳健处理对话动态，在全双工交互指标上达到有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 时序思考机制为全双工语音对话模型提供了一种有效的实时思考范式，显著提升了响应质量，同时保持了实时交互能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 探索金融领域适配大语言模型在金融自然语言处理中的优势和不足，旨在推进金融LLM的有效设计和评估，以支持金融相关决策过程。

Method: 分析FinMA模型架构，使用金融指令调优数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下进行评估。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要任务中面临显著挑战。

Conclusion: 金融领域LLM在特定任务中表现优异，但在复杂推理任务中仍需改进，为金融LLM的设计和评估提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large

(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial

adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial

Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

TL;DR: LLM评估中示例分隔符的选择对模型性能有显著影响，不同分隔符可导致MMLU性能±23%的变化，甚至能操纵模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM评估中示例分隔符选择对模型响应质量的影响，发现这个看似次要的选择实际上能显著改变模型性能。

Method: 通过测试不同分隔符（逗号、换行、分号、井号等）在MMLU等任务上的表现，分析注意力头得分，并探索提高鲁棒性的方法。

Result: 分隔符选择导致MMLU性能±23%变化，可操纵模型排名；良好分隔符能引导注意力到关键token；在提示中指定分隔符可提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM对分隔符选择极其敏感，这种脆弱性普遍存在且不随规模改善；建议在提示中明确指定分隔符以提高评估稳定性。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模公共讨论产生大量自由形式贡献，需要生成具有代表性和中立性的摘要用于政策制定。LLMs虽然能生成摘要，但存在少数派观点代表性不足和输入顺序偏见的问题，在重要政策背景下引发公平性担忧。

Method: 构建DeliberationBank数据集，包含10个讨论问题的3000名参与者意见数据，以及4500名参与者在四个维度上的摘要评估数据。基于此训练DeliberationJudge模型，一个微调的DeBERTa模型，能够从个体角度评估讨论摘要。

Result: DeliberationJudge比多种LLM评估者更高效且与人类判断更一致。评估18个LLM发现讨论摘要存在持续弱点，特别是少数派立场的代表性不足。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可扩展且可靠的讨论摘要评估方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative
and equitable for policymaking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决大语言模型推理过程中产生的幻觉问题，提高模型可靠性，需要开发轻量级但有效的自动检测方法。

Method: 通过系统分类和提示工程控制生成不同类型的幻觉，使用嵌入模型将幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，通过降维和无监督学习分析幻觉与真实响应的空间分布。

Result: 定量评估显示，幻觉的信息失真严重程度与其与正确输出簇的空间偏离存在一致相关性，简单分类算法就能可靠地区分幻觉和准确响应。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个轻量级但有效的框架，通过空间分布分析可以可靠检测LLM幻觉，为提高模型可靠性提供了理论和实证依据。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为探索性退火解码（EAD）的新方法，通过在生成过程中从高到低退火采样温度，实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的策略，显著提升了强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）中LLM的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡探索与利用的挑战：高温会降低样本质量，低温会限制发现。需要一种既能保持样本质量又能确保训练稳定性的探索策略。

Method: EAD方法在生成过程中动态调整采样温度，从高温度开始鼓励语义方向的多样性探索，然后逐渐降低温度以保持样本质量和接近目标策略分布。

Result: EAD作为轻量级即插即用方法，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模下都显著优于固定温度采样，提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 将探索策略与序列生成的自然动态对齐，是提升LLM推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

TL;DR: Camellia基准测试评估多语言大模型在9种亚洲语言中的文化偏见，发现LLMs在文化适应、情感关联和实体抽取方面存在显著偏差，且不同模型家族表现出不同的文化偏见模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准测试，不清楚LLMs在不同非西方语言中是否存在文化偏见。先前研究表明LLMs在阿拉伯语中偏向西方实体，需要评估亚洲语言中的文化公平性。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含9种亚洲语言的19,530个手动标注文化关联的实体和2,173个社交媒体来源的掩码上下文，评估4个多语言LLM家族在文化适应、情感关联和实体抽取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在所有亚洲语言中都难以进行文化适应，性能因模型开发地区对文化相关数据的访问权限而异；不同LLM家族持有独特的偏见模式，在文化情感关联上表现不同；LLMs在亚洲语言上下文理解上存在困难，导致实体抽取中的文化性能差距。

Conclusion: 多语言LLMs在亚洲语言中存在显著的文化偏见，需要改进文化适应能力和上下文理解，特别是在处理亚洲文化实体时。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

TL;DR: LLM-based guardrail models are vulnerable to data distribution shifts, particularly when benign documents are inserted into the context, altering their judgments in 11% (input) and 8% (output) of cases.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保LLM系统的安全性成为迫切需求。基于外部LLM的护栏模型虽然流行，但它们本身也是微调或提示工程的LLM，容易受到数据分布变化的影响。

Method: 以检索增强生成(RAG)为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，测试它们在上下文嵌入额外信息时的鲁棒性。分析了增强上下文中每个组件的影响：检索文档、用户查询和LLM生成响应。

Result: 在护栏上下文中插入良性文档会改变输入和输出护栏的判断，分别影响约11%和8%的情况，使它们不可靠。测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改进。

Conclusion: 这些结果暴露了当前护栏模型在上下文鲁棒性方面的差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案包含丰富的社会脆弱性和韧性信息，但由于规模庞大、数字化质量差和语言古老，难以转化为结构化知识用于气候研究。

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含WeatherArchive-Retrieval（从百万档案段落中检索相关段落）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（LLM分类社会脆弱性和韧性指标）两个任务。

Result: 密集检索器在历史术语上表现不佳，LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在复杂社会指标推理方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候档案RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为残差相似度(RS)的新方法，通过神经网络补充可解释特征系统来提高性能，同时保持可解释性。该方法使用神经网络预测可解释系统的相似度误差，在四个数据集上的评估表明能匹配最先进模型的性能，并展示预测的可信度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者身份验证系统不仅需要高准确性，还需要可解释的解决方案。更重要的是，对于具有现实世界后果的决策，模型的预测必须能够使用可追溯到原始文本的可解释特征来解释。神经网络方法虽然准确性高，但缺乏直接可解释性，且LLM预测无法忠实地解释推理过程。

Method: 提出了残差相似度(RS)方法，将神经网络与可解释特征系统结合。核心思想是使用神经网络预测相似度残差，即可解释系统预测的相似度误差。作者身份验证本质上是相似性任务，目标是衡量两个文档的相似程度。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能够匹配最先进的作者身份验证模型的性能，而且能够展示最终预测的可信度和可解释程度。

Conclusion: 残差相似度方法能够在保持可解释性的同时提高性能，解决了神经网络方法缺乏直接可解释性的问题，为具有现实世界后果的决策提供了可信的解释基础。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度已成为上下文长度增加时的重要瓶颈，需要探索更高效的替代方案。

Method: 系统综述和批判性分析各种方法，包括亚二次注意力变体、循环神经网络、状态空间模型和混合架构。

Result: 分析了这些方法在计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果方面的表现。

Conclusion: 评估了这些方法是否能够挑战纯注意力Transformer在序列处理任务中的主导地位。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 研究发现即使大语言模型能完美检索相关信息，其性能仍会因输入长度增加而显著下降，这揭示了输入长度本身对模型性能的负面影响，并提出了一种简单的缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在长上下文任务中性能下降的根本原因，检验即使完美检索情况下性能是否仍会受输入长度影响。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源LLM进行系统实验，包括替换无关标记为空白、强制模型仅关注相关标记等设置。

Result: 即使模型能完美检索所有相关信息，当输入长度增加但仍在其声称支持范围内时，性能仍会显著下降13.9%-85%。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害LLM性能，与检索质量和干扰无关，提出的缓解策略通过让模型复述检索证据将长上下文任务转换为短上下文任务，在GPT-4o上观察到高达4%的改进。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且在临床NLP中代表性不足。当前健康本体和心理健康资源主要基于英语或西方文化的诊断框架，无法充分代表印度语言中患者的痛苦表达。

Method: 使用图基方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，将其跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 提出了CL-PDE框架，能够解决医疗沟通中的关键差距，使AI系统基于文化有效的表征。

Conclusion: 该方法为多语言环境下的心理健康护理提供了更具包容性和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Conclusion: LLM驱动的多智能体系统能够有效自动化结构工程中的有限元建模任务，展示了在专业工程领域应用的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的原理常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定偏差，直接用作监督会传播噪声并影响训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个无监督信任指标：自一致性、类别蕴含对齐和LLM一致性评分，构建统一信任分数来筛选训练样本。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上，该方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可靠的范式，利用推理感知的信任指标进行专利分析，提高了LLM原理的利用效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Motivation: 由于人类评估成本高、耗时长且难以复现，需要探索使用LLM模拟用户作为自动助手评估的替代方案，但目前缺乏系统性的基准来验证这些模拟用户的可靠性。

Method: 构建SimulatorArena基准，包含数学辅导和文档创建两个交互任务，评估各种模拟器方法，特别关注基于用户画像（背景和消息风格）的模拟器。

Result: 基于用户画像的模拟器与人类判断高度一致，在两个任务上的Spearman相关系数ρ均达到0.7，可作为人类评估的实用、可扩展替代方案。

Conclusion: 条件化用户画像的模拟器能够可靠地替代真实用户进行助手评估，使用最佳模拟器对18个助手（包括GPT-5、Claude 4.1 Opus等最新LLM）进行了基准测试。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Conclusion: 基于图监督的多智能体路由方法在问答任务中具有有效性和鲁棒性，能够捕捉不同智能体的互补优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

Conclusion: TensorBLEU将显著瓶颈转化为训练循环中可忽略的部分，为RL模型微调等研究领域提供强大工具。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用和简化的环境规范，可能导致高估LLMs的规划能力并在下游任务中引发安全问题，需要更丰富的约束来评估真实规划能力。

Method: 通过手动标注为四个正式定义类别的约束增强广泛使用的规划基准，在4个最先进推理LLMs、3种形式语言、5种方法和4个数据集上进行系统评估。

Result: 约束引入不仅使性能一致减半，还显著挑战了对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 需要更丰富的约束基准来准确评估LLMs的真实规划能力，现有基准可能高估其性能。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

Motivation: 现有LLM依赖显式推理指令或静态引导方法，缺乏自适应、无需指令的推理增强方法

Method: 通过聚类CoT和中性提示的激活差异创建推理原型，在推理时将输入隐藏状态投影到这些原型上形成实例特定的引导向量

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上持续提升准确率，即使显式抑制CoT时增益仍然存在

Conclusion: 基于原型的动态引导是增强LLM推理能力的轻量级替代方案，能够加强潜在推理过程而非仅引发表面行为变化

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time

TL;DR: 本文提出CAM（建构主义代理记忆），基于皮亚杰建构主义理论为LLM设计结构化记忆模块，解决长文档理解中的信息过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在处理长文档时面临信息过载挑战，需要一种连贯的记忆模块来提升阅读理解能力，而现有方法缺乏系统设计原则。

Method: 受皮亚杰建构主义理论启发，设计具有结构化图式、灵活同化和动态顺应特性的记忆系统，采用增量重叠聚类算法构建结构化记忆，支持层次化摘要和在线批量集成。

Result: 在问答、查询摘要和声明验证等长文本理解任务中，CAM在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于建构主义理论设计的CAM记忆系统为LLM提供了更强大和高效的长文档理解能力，验证了结构化记忆模块的有效性。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

TL;DR: KEO是一个针对安全关键领域的知识提取和推理框架，使用LLMs构建知识图谱并集成到RAG流程中，显著提升全局感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对安全关键领域，需要更可靠的知识提取和推理方法，传统文本块RAG在全局感知方面存在局限。

Method: 构建结构化知识图谱并集成到检索增强生成流程中，使用本地可部署LLMs进行实验，并用更强模型作为评估者。

Result: KEO显著改善了全局感知能力，能揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务中仍有效。

Conclusion: KG增强的LLMs在安全、领域特定的问答中具有前景，在高风险推理中具有潜力。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

### [123] [H1B-KV: Hybrid One-Bit Caches for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05529)
*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，将7B参数LLM的8k上下文缓存从4GB压缩到60MB，实现70倍内存减少，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码中KV缓存的内存占用随上下文增长而增加，成为内存瓶颈问题。现有方法如量化缓存、令牌驱逐或仅压缩键向量等方法不完整，无法全面解决内存问题。

Method: 提出混合1位KV缓存(H1B-KV)：键向量用1位二进制草图表示，支持硬件友好的位运算注意力；值向量使用4位量化。通过轻量级微调实现压缩。

Result: 7B参数LLM处理8k上下文时，缓存内存从4GB降至60MB(70倍减少)。在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务(数学推理GSM8K、多任务理解MMLU、代码生成HumanEval)上匹配全精度性能，在质量-字节比上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H1B-KV为内存受限环境中部署LLM提供了稳健解决方案，通过全面压缩方案显著减少内存使用而不牺牲上下文信息。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了提示难度对自博弈偏好优化的影响，发现困难提示会降低模型性能，而选择性移除困难提示可以提升整体表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈偏好优化已成为对齐大语言模型的重要范式，但提示作为该流程的核心组件，其作用尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究不同难度提示如何影响自博弈偏好优化。

Method: 使用提示的N个采样响应的平均奖励作为难度代理指标，分析困难提示和简单提示在自博弈优化中的表现差异，并探索选择性移除困难提示的策略。

Result: 困难提示的自博弈优化性能显著低于简单提示；将困难提示纳入训练不仅无法提升整体性能，反而会导致轻微性能下降；模型容量增加时，困难提示和简单提示之间的性能差距会缩小。

Conclusion: 提示难度与模型容量存在交互作用，选择性移除适当比例的困难提示可以增强整体自博弈性能，这为优化自博弈偏好训练提供了实用策略。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在部署时面临的内存和计算挑战，现有压缩方法缺乏理论指导。

Method: 提出Pareto-Guided SVD (PGSVD)方法，包括：1) 理论分析网络损失变化的上界；2) 将压缩建模为双目标优化；3) 帕累托引导的秩选择和交替最小二乘实现。

Result: 在相同压缩水平下，PGSVD相比现有方法在LLM和VLM上实现了更好的准确性和推理加速。

Conclusion: PGSVD为零样本压缩提供了理论指导，在保持模型性能的同时有效解决了部署挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Motivation: 现有自动化方法在讲故事能力、美学质量和自我调整方面存在局限，难以实现高效吸引人的传播。核心问题是：无法评估就无法改进。

Method: 引入EvoPresent自改进代理框架和PresAesth多任务强化学习美学模型，构建包含650篇顶级AI会议论文和2000张幻灯片对的综合基准进行评估。

Result: 研究发现：(i)高质量反馈对代理自改进至关重要；(ii)自动化生成管道在视觉设计和内容构建间存在权衡；(iii)多任务强化学习在美学感知任务中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvoPresent通过统一叙事、美学设计和演示交付，结合可靠的评估反馈机制，有效解决了学术论文推广中的关键挑战。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理在处理开放领域多跳推理任务时，由于依赖固定的行动序列而难以应对需要大量信息检索的问题。

Method: 基于关键实体构建初始节点，通过历史错误分析和实时反馈动态生成推理子节点，结合深度优先搜索和创新的节点生成技术来调整推理策略。

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上达到54.47% F1分数，在StrategyQA数据集上达到70.05% F1分数，分别比最佳基线高出5.03%和7.25%。

Conclusion: FGDIP框架通过动态自适应策略有效扩展了搜索空间，同时确保推理过程系统性地收敛到准确解，在多跳推理任务中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 基于大语言模型的代理在长视野任务中缺乏全局规划，导致盲目试错和产生幻觉行为，需要提升其规划能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：首先通过同源共识过滤策略从先进LLM合成高质量规划进行微调，然后使用基于规则的强化学习阶段，采用执行器能力增益奖励来进一步提升规划器。

Result: 在三个长视野代理任务上的实验表明，配备该规划器的执行代理优于现有方法，达到新的最先进性能，同时训练成本比基于RL的基线降低8倍。

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一种高效有效的解决方案，无需人工努力或额外训练数据，显著提升了代理在长视野任务中的规划能力。

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

TL;DR: 提出了一个多智能体辩论框架，通过多个MLLM智能体迭代优化推理，显著提升了隐式属性值抽取的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式属性值抽取在电子商务中至关重要，但由于多维数据的复杂性和视觉-文本理解差距，现有MLLM方法仍面临挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体辩论框架，多个MLLM智能体通过多轮辩论相互验证和更新响应，迭代优化推理过程。

Result: 在ImplicitAVE数据集上的实验表明，即使几轮辩论也能显著提高准确性，特别是对初始性能较低的属性效果更明显。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论策略能够解决单智能体方法的局限性，为多模态电子商务中的隐式属性值抽取提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)方法，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，缓解大语言模型对英语作为潜在表示的依赖，从而提升多语言性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备多语言能力，但其推理过程依赖内部翻译到英语，当翻译失败时非英语语言性能急剧下降，限制了LLM应用的包容性。现有跨语言上下文学习方法主要使用单语演示，未能缓解反而强化了这一翻译障碍。

Method: 引入代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，为英语推理提供显式支架，作为隐式语言桥梁增强跨语言对齐。

Result: 在4个LLM、6个数据集和10种语言的广泛实验中，CSICL始终优于跨语言上下文学习基线，在目标语言和未见语言上分别获得3.1%和1.9%的性能提升，在低资源设置下提升更显著(目标语言14.7%，未见语言5.3%)。

Conclusion: 代码转换是一种原则性且稳健的方法，可在推理过程中克服翻译障碍，推动LLM朝着更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知的优化策略在保持模型精度的同时实现高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度显著下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略来平衡压缩率和模型性能。

Method: 采用结构化稀疏因子分解，将权重矩阵表示为稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的组合，利用校准数据集优化因子分解以最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在多个Llama和Qwen模型上均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法，在准确性和困惑度方面表现一致优越。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的有力替代方案，为高效LLM部署提供了新的压缩范式。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

Conclusion: DecEx-RAG为过程监督的RAG训练提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了LLM在自主任务分解、动态检索和高质量答案生成方面的能力。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is

*Liza Fretel,Baptiste Cecconi,Laura Debisschop*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发一种生成多源天文观测设施映射的方法论，使用可调整标准和NLP技术比较实体，并通过LLM验证映射建议，最终创建多源同义词集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为天文观测设施创建统一的多源映射，以支持名称解析API和国际虚拟天文台联盟词汇表的集成。

Method: 使用可调整标准和NLP技术（词袋方法、序列方法和表面方法）计算实体相似度得分，利用所有可用属性，并通过LLM验证映射建议。

Result: 生成了由多源同义词集组成的映射，每个实体只提供一个标准化标签。

Conclusion: 该方法能够创建可信且符合FAIR原则的映射，将用于名称解析API和天文词汇平台的集成。

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

*Peter Ochieng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文推导了非渐近谱带，通过对齐度、温度和批次谱来约束InfoNCE梯度范数的平方，恢复了1/τ²定律，并在合成数据和ImageNet上紧密跟踪批次平均梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究InfoNCE损失的梯度特性，特别是如何通过谱分析和各向异性代理来优化批次选择和训练效率。

Method: 使用有效秩R_eff作为各向异性代理，设计谱感知批次选择方法，包括快速贪婪构建器，并在ImageNet-100和CIFAR-10上进行实验验证。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1准确率的时间减少了15%，在CIFAR-10上也有类似增益。批次内白化将50步梯度方差降低了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 谱感知批次选择和批次内白化能有效提升训练效率和梯度稳定性，理论与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

*Jianbin Shen,Christy Jie Liang,Junyu Xuan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的抽象文本摘要学习方法，通过最优传输信息注意力机制和命名实体累积联合熵减少方法来提高摘要的信息性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要将大量文本数据转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息性方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用两种方法：基于最优传输的信息注意力机制来学习参考摘要中的关键信息，以及命名实体上的累积联合熵减少方法来增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上获得了比先前工作更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum上具有竞争力。人工评估也显示该方法在信息性方面优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了抽象文本摘要的信息性，并通过进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE层在推理时参数激活高度稀疏，提出MoNE方法通过神经元粒度专家选择，仅激活50%参数即可达到传统MoE性能，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE模型在推理时的参数激活稀疏性，发现大多数神经元激活值接近零，这为优化参数利用提供了机会。

Method: 提出Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE)，在每个专家内部进行简单的top-k选择，仅激活高激活值的神经元，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Result: MoNE在仅激活50%MoE层参数的情况下匹配传统MoE性能，在同等激活参数数量下持续优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是提高MoE类模型参数利用率和推理效率的实用方法。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

*Rikuto Kotoge,Yuichi Sasaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TKTO是一种无需配对数据的文本转语音偏好优化方法，直接针对token级单元进行优化，显著提高了日语TTS的准确性和自然度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统需要成对的好/坏样本进行偏好优化，但这类数据有限，且基于语句级别的优化无法实现细粒度的发音对齐。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单元进行优化，自动提供细粒度的对齐信号，无需token级标注。

Result: TKTO将日语TTS准确率提高了39%，CER降低了54%，为目标token自动分配了12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO提供了一种更数据高效的训练范式，能够实现细粒度的token级优化，显著提升TTS系统的发音准确性。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

### [139] [EEPO: Exploration-Enhanced Policy Optimization via Sample-Then-Forget](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05837)
*Liang Chen,Xueting Han,Qizhou Wang,Bo Han,Jing Bai,Hinrich Schutze,Kam-Fai Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EEPO是一个增强探索的强化学习框架，通过两阶段生成和自适应遗忘机制解决RLVR中的探索-利用平衡问题，在多个推理基准上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法过于强调利用，导致熵崩溃和探索能力下降，形成自我强化的循环，限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段生成：第一阶段生成一半轨迹，然后通过轻量级遗忘步骤暂时抑制这些响应，迫使第二阶段探索输出空间的不同区域。

Result: 在五个推理基准上，EEPO显著优于GRPO，在Qwen2.5-3B、Llama3.2-3B-Instruct和Qwen3-8B-Base上分别实现24.3%、33.0%和10.4%的平均相对增益。

Conclusion: EEPO通过样本-遗忘机制有效打破自我强化循环，促进更广泛的探索，在RLVR中实现了更好的探索-利用平衡。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

*Maxence Lasbordes,Sinoué Gad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Luth是一系列专门针对法语的小型语言模型，通过有针对性的后训练在精选的高质量法语数据上，在多个法语基准测试中超越了所有同规模的开源模型，同时保持了原有的英语能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型主要以英语为中心，导致其他主要语言（如法语）在小型语言模型中的性能存在显著差距。现有的多语言模型在法语上的表现远低于英语，且针对法语的高效适应方法研究有限。

Method: 通过有针对性的后训练在精选的高质量法语数据上，并采用策略性的模型融合方法来提升双语性能。

Result: Luth模型在多个法语基准测试中超越了所有同规模的开源模型，同时保持了原有的英语能力。模型融合进一步提升了两种语言的性能。

Conclusion: Luth为法语小型语言模型设立了新的技术标杆，并为未来的法语语言研究提供了强大的基准模型。

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探索了使用持续预训练作为可扩展的自监督方法，来使大语言模型适应下游摘要任务，特别是在嘈杂的真实世界对话转录场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在文本摘要方面表现出色，但在应用于与原始预训练分布不同的专业领域或对话数据时性能往往不足。虽然微调可以提高摘要质量，但通常依赖于昂贵且稀缺的高质量标注数据。

Method: 采用持续预训练方法，使用大规模无标签商务对话数据来增强模型在对话摘要方面的能力，并分析数据选择策略的影响。

Result: 持续预训练在领域内和领域外摘要基准测试中都带来了显著提升，同时保持了强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 持续预训练是提高LLM在对话摘要任务中性能的有效方法，为面向摘要的工业应用提供了实用指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

*Luka Nenadic,David Rodriguez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了2023年瑞士隐私法修订对隐私政策合规性的影响，发现使用自动合同生成器的网站合规性显著提高（最多提升15个百分点），18%的本地网站使用了生成器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是中小企业缺乏资源起草复杂法律文件。虽然自动合同生成器服务存在已久，但缺乏关于其普及度和输出质量的实证证据。

Method: 创建并标注了一个多语言基准数据集，捕捉瑞士和欧盟隐私法下的关键合规义务。使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模隐私政策合规性评估。

Result: 观察到合规性增加，表明修订产生了影响。使用生成器的网站合规性水平显著更高，相比未使用生成器的隐私政策，合规性最多提高15个百分点。

Conclusion: 研究结果对三个议题有贡献：LLM在跨语言法律分析中的潜力、欧盟法规的布鲁塞尔效应，以及自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量方面的作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Context Denoising Training (CDT)的训练策略，通过检测和缓解上下文噪声来提升长上下文模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文模型容易受到上下文噪声（不相关标记）的影响，这会误导模型注意力，影响预测准确性。

Method: 提出集成梯度(IG)分数来检测和量化上下文噪声，并设计CDT训练策略，通过缓解噪声来增强对关键标记的关注。

Result: 在四个任务上的实验表明，CDT能显著提升模型性能，使用CDT训练的8B开源模型能达到与GPT-4o相当的性能。

Conclusion: CDT是一种简单有效的训练策略，能有效提升长上下文模型对关键信息的关注度，改善预测性能。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

### [144] [Evaluating the Sensitivity of LLMs to Harmful Contents in Long Input](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05864)
*Faeze Ghorbanpour,Alexander Fraser*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了LLMs在长上下文环境中对有害内容的敏感性，发现性能在中等有害内容比例时最佳，但随着上下文长度增加而下降，且显性内容比隐性内容更容易被识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs的长上下文能力在推理和检索方面已有研究，但在安全关键场景下的行为尚不清楚，需要评估LLMs对有害内容的敏感性。

Method: 通过改变有害内容的类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、比例（0.01-0.50）和上下文长度（600-6000 tokens），在LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral等模型上评估其检测有毒、冒犯性和仇恨言论的能力。

Result: 观察到相似模式：性能在中等有害内容比例（0.25）时达到峰值，但在内容过于稀疏或主导时下降；召回率随上下文长度增加而降低；开头的有害句子检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现首次系统揭示了LLMs在长上下文中如何优先处理和校准有害内容，既展示了其新兴优势，也指出了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly support applications that rely on
extended context, from document processing to retrieval-augmented generation.
While their long-context capabilities are well studied for reasoning and
retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

### [145] [The fragility of "cultural tendencies" in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05869)
*Kun Sun,Rong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文批判性地重新评估了LSZ关于大语言模型在不同语言提示下表现出文化特定倾向的研究，认为其报告的"文化倾向"是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，而非稳定特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑LSZ的研究结论，认为其方法、实验设计和解释存在问题，需要更严谨地验证语言提示是否真能引发显著的文化倾向变化。

Method: 使用更广泛的LLM集合和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，检验语言提示对输出的实际影响。

Result: 结果显示语言提示对输出的影响很小，挑战了LSZ关于这些模型编码了根深蒂固文化信念的论断。

Conclusion: LLM在不同语言提示下表现出的"文化倾向"并非稳定特征，而是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，语言提示本身不足以引发显著的文化倾向变化。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮交互中表现不佳，常常依赖错误的早期假设且无法跟踪用户目标随时间变化，而对话系统中的长期规划对处理交互任务至关重要。

Method: 基于强化学习的提示优化框架，通过生成逐轮反馈并利用经验回放进行提示重写，仅修改LLM代理的任务指令提示来实现规划能力。

Result: 在文本到SQL和任务导向对话等多轮任务中显示出显著改进，能够泛化到不同的LLM代理，并可以利用多样化的LLM作为元提示代理。

Conclusion: 该方法为无参数的强化学习优化方法开辟了未来研究的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个四部分框架来分析文化基准，识别了当前文化评估中的六个方法论问题，并基于人类学方法提出了改进建议，旨在开发能更准确捕捉模型对复杂文化情境响应的基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的文化评估基准往往将文化简化为静态事实或同质化价值观，这与人类学强调文化是动态、历史情境化和实践中体现的观点相冲突。

Method: 引入四部分框架对文化基准进行分类（如知识、偏好、性能或偏见），定性分析20个文化基准，识别六个方法论问题，并基于人类学方法提出具体改进建议。

Result: 识别了六个常见方法论问题：将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内部多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等。

Conclusion: 建议通过融入真实世界叙事和场景、让文化社区参与设计和验证、在情境而非孤立环境中评估模型等方法来改进文化基准，使其超越静态回忆任务，更准确评估模型对复杂文化情境的响应。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型在不同文化背景下的道德对齐，发现模型在西方和非西方地区存在系统性偏差。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查（55个国家，19个主题）和皮尤全球态度调查（39个国家，8个主题），结合两种评分方法和模型作为评审的同行评审机制。

Result: 顶级模型与调查结果高度一致（WVS皮尔逊相关系数约0.90），但存在明显的地区差异：西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61，差距达0.21。同行评审识别出348个冲突。

Conclusion: 研究显示在文化感知AI方面取得实际进展，但跨地区使用仍面临挑战，需要解决系统性地区偏差问题。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型在内部表征中隐式编码了问题难度信息，通过线性探针可以在最终Transformer层的特定注意力头中检测到难度感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型是否具备内部评估问题难度的能力，这对于自适应推理和高效资源分配至关重要。

Method: 使用线性探针分析LLMs最终token的表征，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的特定注意力头。

Result: 数学问题的难度级别可以通过线性建模检测，特定注意力头对简单和困难问题表现出相反的激活模式，证明LLMs具备难度感知能力。

Conclusion: LLMs中的难度感知不仅存在且具有结构性组织，为自动难度标注提供了实用支持，可减少人工标注成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Rishi Hazra,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiCon是一个基于自然语言的约束规划基准测试，用于评估LLM在带约束规划任务中的表现，发现当前最先进的LLM在约束程度增加时性能会下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在无约束规划任务中表现良好，但在现实世界应用中需要遵守约束条件（特别是安全约束），因此需要评估它们在约束规划任务中的能力。

Method: 基于现有规划环境添加时间约束，然后将这些约束问题转化为自然语言交给LLM解决。LexiCon具有可扩展性，可以自动为新环境生成时间约束。

Result: 实验表明，包括GPT-5、o3和R1在内的最先进LLM，在规划任务的约束程度增加时，性能会显著下降。

Conclusion: LexiCon提供了一个系统化的方法来评估LLM在约束规划任务中的能力，揭示了当前LLM在复杂约束环境下的局限性，为未来LLM规划能力的改进提供了基准。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

TL;DR: 本文通过重新评估GPT-2在寄生空位结构上的表现，论证了直接最小对比对方法比差异中的差异方法更能有效评估语言模型的句法能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用不同评估方法对语言模型学习复杂句法的能力得出矛盾结论，需要澄清哪种评估方法更具诊断价值。

Method: 生成完整的8种排列的寄生空位刺激范式，使用Wilcox风格的最小对比对方法系统评估GPT-2模型。

Result: GPT-2在所有四个测试条件下都成功表现出对填充语-空位许可原则的稳健知识，即使在复杂寄生空位环境中。

Conclusion: 评估方法的选择对判断语言模型的句法能力至关重要，直接最小对比对方法比DiD方法提供更清晰的诊断结果。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A共享适配架构，通过使用多个专家A矩阵来丰富特征提取，解决LoRA中单一降维矩阵导致的表征瓶颈问题，在保持参数效率的同时提升下游任务适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA方法依赖单一降维矩阵A作为特征提取器，无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样化信号，这限制了其在下游任务中的适应能力。

Method: 提出MASA架构，采用多A单B结构：使用多个专家A矩阵组成的集合来捕获多样化特征，然后通过层特定的单一B矩阵进行集成，这些多A专家在不同层间非对称共享以确保参数效率。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA平均准确率达到59.62%，比标准LoRA提升1.08个百分点（相对改进1.84%），而可学习参数仅为0.52%。

Conclusion: MASA通过丰富特征适配有效提升了参数高效微调的性能，在多领域泛化、单领域专业化和多任务推理等场景中均表现出色。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Result: 初步发现表明，与基线相比，GPT-2在这些精炼的PG刺激物上表现出显著改善的性能

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果，精炼刺激物能更准确地评估模型的句法能力

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文大语言模型面临独特挑战，主要是中文语料中缺乏结构化表示，现有基准多为英语中心，无法充分评估中文语言特性。

Method: 构建中文数据-文本对(CDTP)数据集，包含对齐的文本和三元组，支持知识图谱补全、三元组到文本生成、问答等多任务评估。

Result: CDTP数据集丰富了中文语料的结构化信息，支持细粒度评估和多任务微调，通过实验验证了基准的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CB-ECLLM基准为中文大语言模型提供了全面评估框架，支持可复现研究，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

TL;DR: 本文提出ASPO方法，通过翻转正优势token的重要性采样比率，解决了OSRL中token级重要性采样比率不匹配的问题，改善了LLM强化学习的训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有LLM后训练方法中基于token级裁剪的强化学习存在根本缺陷：正优势token的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负token权重不平衡，抑制低概率token更新而过度放大高概率token。

Method: 提出非对称重要性采样策略优化(ASPO)，翻转正优势token的重要性采样比率，使其与负token的学习动态对齐，并采用软双裁剪机制稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试中，ASPO显著缓解了过早收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并在基于GRPO的强基线上增强了最终性能。

Conclusion: 分析为token级权重在OSRL中的作用提供了新见解，强调了在LLM强化学习中修正重要性采样的关键重要性。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

TL;DR: 语言模型后训练虽然提升了指令跟随能力和下游任务表现，但在具有多个有效答案的任务中存在被忽视的代价。研究发现当前后训练技术会降低模型的上下文可控性、有效输出空间覆盖和分布对齐能力。


<details>

Motivation: 研究旨在解决语言模型后训练在具有多个有效答案任务中的负面影响，特别是对上下文可控性、输出空间覆盖和分布对齐能力的损害。

Method: 提出了Spectrum Suite评估资源，包含40多个数据源和90多个任务；开发了Spectrum Tuning后训练方法，使用Spectrum Suite来改善可控性和分布覆盖。

Result: 研究发现当前后训练技术虽然有助于激发潜在能力和知识，但会损害模型的上下文灵活可控性。Spectrum Tuning方法在预训练模型和指令调优模型基础上有所改进，增强了可控性、扩大了输出空间覆盖并改善了分布对齐。

Conclusion: Spectrum Tuning是一种有效的后训练方法，能够缓解当前后训练技术对模型上下文可控性和分布覆盖能力的负面影响，在多个评估指标上表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Motivation: 目前缺乏关于模型性能如何随蒸馏数据量扩展的研究，特别是在代码推理蒸馏方面。

Method: 在两个小型非推理LLM上蒸馏竞争性编程技能，研究性能随数据量变化的趋势，并在不同蒸馏阶段对相同数据进行微调以验证学习阶段。

Result: 发现存在代码推理谷现象，在低和中低数据量下，小模型从较简单的编程问题中获益更多，且训练数据输出的正确性对蒸馏结果没有影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对代码推理蒸馏训练动态的理解，超越了直觉认知。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

Motivation: 研究LLM产生幻觉（看似合理但事实错误的陈述）的内在架构根源，理解这种失败模式的发生机制。

Method: 提出了Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)统一框架，整合可解释性技术来生成模型推理的因果映射；识别了模型产生幻觉不可避免的commitment layer；使用双过程理论解释两种计算路径的冲突。

Result: 发现关联路径（类似系统1）和上下文路径（类似系统2）之间的冲突导致可预测的失败模式；上下文路径的连贯性与幻觉率呈强负相关（ρ = -0.863）。

Conclusion: 为Transformer架构中幻觉如何、何时以及为何发生提供了机制性解释，表明这些失败是内部语义弱点的可预测后果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"并行分词器"的新框架，通过双语词典或词对词翻译来对齐不同语言的分词器词汇表，确保语义相同的词在不同语言中具有一致的索引表示，从而改善跨语言表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多语言模型分词方法无法有效支持跨语言迁移，因为语义相同的词在不同语言中被分配了不同的嵌入表示，限制了跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 首先对每种语言单独训练分词器，然后使用双语词典或词对词翻译来全面对齐不同语言的词汇表，确保语义等效词具有一致的索引。

Result: 在13种低资源语言上从头预训练transformer编码器，并在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似度等任务上评估，使用并行分词器的模型在所有任务上都优于传统的多语言基线。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词方法对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源设置下，并行分词器能够显著提升跨语言性能。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型在并行解码时，由于初始置信度低而频繁重新掩码token，导致冗余迭代，限制了加速效果。

Method: 提出Trace Credit概念量化token收敛潜力，通过融合当前logits和历史追踪信用来加速正确但置信度不足的token的收敛，无需额外训练。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，与主流推理优化正交，是一个即插即用的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

*Jan Cegin,Branislav Pecher,Ivan Srba,Jakub Simko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoSE是一种无需人工标注的代理指标，用于选择最佳LLM生成器来产生训练小模型的合成数据，特别适用于低资源语言场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源语言场景中，人工标注数据稀缺，但LLM能生成高质量文本。然而选择最佳LLM生成器很困难，因为外在评估需要昂贵的人工标注，而内在指标与下游性能相关性差。

Method: 提出RoSE方法：用候选生成器（LLM）的输出训练一个小模型，然后在所有其他候选LLM生成的合成示例上评估该小模型，最终RoSE分数是该小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比任何其他内在启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点。

Conclusion: RoSE是唯一能与人类测试数据性能呈正相关的指标，为低资源语言场景下选择最佳LLM生成器提供了有效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and

*Dingyu Yao,Chenxu Yang,Zhengyang Tong,Zheng Lin,Wei Liu,Jian Luan,Weiping Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新型向量量化方法，通过平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现超低比特位宽下的高效KV缓存压缩，在2位量化时性能接近全精度，同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量量化方法在超低比特位宽下因键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降，无法有效利用码本，限制了KV缓存的压缩效率。

Method: 应用平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存异常值，使码本能全面覆盖原始数据分布；设计优化的CUDA内核，将计算与反量化融合以减少内存访问开销。

Result: 在长上下文理解和数学推理任务中持续优于现有量化基线，2位量化时性能接近全精度，在Llama-3.1-8B上实现2.7倍的大批量自注意力计算加速和8.3倍的单批量端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: VecInfer通过有效抑制异常值和优化部署，实现了在超低比特位宽下的高效KV缓存压缩，为大规模语言模型推理提供了实用的内存优化解决方案。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

*Yoav Gur-Arieh,Mor Geva,Atticus Geiger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文推理中通过位置机制、词汇机制和反射机制三种方式来绑定和检索实体，随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用这三种机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何在上下文中绑定和检索实体，特别是当绑定实体数量增加时，原有的位置机制表现不佳，需要探索其他补偿机制。

Method: 在9个模型和10个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，分析语言模型如何混合使用位置机制、词汇机制和反射机制，并开发结合这三种机制的因果模型。

Result: 发现语言模型在绑定实体数量增加时会混合使用三种机制，开发的因果模型在预测下一个token分布时达到95%的一致性，并能推广到更长的开放文本输入。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型在上下文绑定和检索实体的更完整机制，表明模型通过混合多种机制来应对复杂场景，为理解语言模型的推理能力提供了新视角。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM代码生成工作大多采用单次设置，忽略了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的实际工作流程。

Method: 创建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次，并提出ReCodeAgent框架将反馈整合到迭代代码生成中。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为在科学研究实现中开发自适应、反馈驱动的LLM代理奠定了基础，同时突显了在生成复杂研究代码方面仍存在的挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言且方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准孟加拉语，需要开发包容性的实时语音技术。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构和RTP协议确保低延迟通信，通过微调IndicWav2Vec模型开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，支持10种孟加拉语方言。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型性能提升12.41-33.98%，系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟仅4.9秒。

Conclusion: BanglaTalk通过低带宽使用和最小化延迟，为孟加拉语使用者提供了成本效益高且交互性强的实时语音技术解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

TL;DR: LST模型通过动态聚合语音标记为潜在语音补丁，解决了语音-文本模型中语音序列过长导致的效率问题，在语音和文本任务上都取得了更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语音-文本模型存在语音标记序列远长于文本标记的问题，导致训练和推理时计算不平衡，阻碍语音和文本的有效对齐，并影响扩展规律。

Method: 引入潜在语音-文本变换器(LST)，通过动态且低成本地将语音标记聚合为潜在语音补丁，这些补丁可作为与文本单元对齐的高级单元或封装常见语音序列以提高计算效率。

Result: LST在语音到语音和文本到文本基准测试中优于传统方法，在计算控制和数据控制设置下都表现更好。在HellaSwag故事补全任务中，语音准确率分别提升6.5%和5.3%。

Conclusion: LST通过潜在语音补丁机制提高了语音-文本模型的数据效率，实现了更有效的表示对齐和更陡峭的扩展规律。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 解决传统关系抽取方法缺乏语言解释监督的问题，通过促进包含重要关系关键词的输出来提高可解释性。

Method: 1) 基于认知科学的文本处理推理机制；2) 使用强化学习优化，设计新颖奖励函数同时提升任务准确性和解释质量；3) 自动构建高质量关键词词典。

Result: 在少样本关系抽取任务中，CogRE显著提升性能：Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct在One-shot NYT29上达到24.65% F1，强化学习优化后绝对提升23.46%；人类评估显示解释质量相对提升54%。

Conclusion: CogRE框架通过认知结构化推理和强化学习优化，有效解决了少样本关系抽取中的注意力不集中和少样本学习能力有限的问题，在准确性和可解释性方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计基于大语言模型的安全关键智能体需要超越简单的提示工程，需要深入理解规则编码如何影响注意力机制和合规行为。

Method: 采用信息论分析多种注意力架构（因果、双向、局部稀疏、核化、交叉注意力），建立指针保真度边界，并结合动态规则验证架构。

Result: 证明具有低语法熵和集中锚点的规则格式能降低注意力熵并提高指针保真度，但存在锚点冗余与注意力熵的权衡；动态规则验证架构可提高合规输出的渐近概率。

Conclusion: 需要原则性的锚点设计和双重执行机制来保护基于LLM的智能体免受提示注入攻击，同时在演进领域中保持合规性。

Abstract: The design of safety-critical agents based on large language models (LLMs)
requires more than simple prompt engineering. This paper presents a
comprehensive information-theoretic analysis of how rule encodings in system
prompts influence attention mechanisms and compliance behaviour. We demonstrate
that rule formats with low syntactic entropy and highly concentrated anchors
reduce attention entropy and improve pointer fidelity, but reveal a fundamental
trade-off between anchor redundancy and attention entropy that previous work
failed to recognize. Through formal analysis of multiple attention
architectures including causal, bidirectional, local sparse, kernelized, and
cross-attention mechanisms, we establish bounds on pointer fidelity and show
how anchor placement strategies must account for competing fidelity and entropy
objectives. Combining these insights with a dynamic rule verification
architecture, we provide a formal proof that hot reloading of verified rule
sets increases the asymptotic probability of compliant outputs. These findings
underscore the necessity of principled anchor design and dual enforcement
mechanisms to protect LLM-based agents against prompt injection attacks while
maintaining compliance in evolving domains.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM框架在推理、记忆和控制功能上相互交织，导致多步任务中连贯性和可预测性降低，需要更清晰的架构来提升可靠性和可追踪性

Method: SCL架构将语言模型专用于推理，外部维护记忆，由轻量级控制器在目标导向循环中指导执行，允许中间结果存储、重访和检查

Result: 在360个测试场景中，SCL任务成功率平均86.3%，优于基线方法的70-77%，目标保真度更高，冗余调用减少，中间状态重用更可靠

Conclusion: 架构分离可以在不依赖更大模型或更重提示的情况下提高可靠性和可追踪性，为扩展研究提供了指导方向

Abstract: Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and
generation, yet their use as autonomous agents raises architectural challenges
for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often intertwine inference, memory,
and control in a single prompt, which can reduce coherence and predictability.
The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is introduced as an alternative
architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model is
dedicated to inference, memory is maintained externally, and execution is
guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design
offloads cognitive load from the model and allows intermediate results to be
stored, revisited, and checked before actions are taken, providing a clearer
basis for traceability and evaluation.
  We evaluate SCL against prompt-based baselines including ReAct and common
LangChain agents across three scenarios: temperature-based travel planning,
email drafting with conditional send, and constraint-guided image generation.
All systems share the same base model and tools under matched decoding
settings. Across 360 episodes, SCL shows modest but consistent improvements.
Task success averages 86.3 percent compared with 70-77 percent for baselines.
Goal fidelity is higher, redundant calls are fewer, intermediate states are
reused more reliably, and unsupported assertions per 100 tool calls are
reduced. Ablations show that external memory and control each contribute
independently, and decoding sweeps confirm stability of the effects.
  These results suggest that architectural separation can improve reliability
and traceability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The
findings are preliminary and intended to guide extended studies with additional
models, longer horizons, multimodal tasks, and collaborative settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的优化建模方法主要依赖求解器驱动，通过单次前向生成和有限的错误修复，容易产生语法正确但逻辑错误的模型，无法检测语义错误。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，在每个步骤中将原始语义锚点与从生成代码重构的锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配的组件，实现细粒度的约束和目标逻辑优化。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上最高提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正对于确保LLM基于优化工作流中从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理复杂规则系统时面临挑战，通常将相互依赖的规则视为非结构化文本而非逻辑组织框架，导致推理偏差和关键规则依赖关系的忽略。

Method: DAT框架包含三个方法化阶段：定性分析（全面评估上下文环境）、证据收集（基于模板元素的有针对性信息提取和规则验证）、裁决（综合验证组件形成全面判断）。

Result: 实证结果表明DAT在复杂规则任务中持续优于传统CoT方法，且能使较小语言模型达到甚至超过更大LLMs的性能。

Conclusion: DAT框架通过结构化推理机制有效管理复杂规则系统，在效率和效果上表现出色，为LLMs的规则处理提供了系统性解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges when processing
complex rule systems, as they typically treat interdependent rules as
unstructured textual data rather than as logically organized frameworks. This
limitation results in reasoning divergence, where models often overlook
critical rule dependencies essential for accurate interpretation. Although
existing approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning have shown
promise, they lack systematic methodologies for structured rule processing and
are particularly susceptible to error propagation through sequential reasoning
chains. To address these limitations, we propose the Dynamic Adjudication
Template (DAT), a novel framework inspired by expert human reasoning processes.
DAT structures the inference mechanism into three methodical stages:
qualitative analysis, evidence gathering, and adjudication. During the
qualitative analysis phase, the model comprehensively evaluates the contextual
landscape. The subsequent evidence gathering phase involves the targeted
extraction of pertinent information based on predefined template elements
([placeholder]), followed by systematic verification against applicable rules.
Finally, in the adjudication phase, the model synthesizes these validated
components to formulate a comprehensive judgment. Empirical results demonstrate
that DAT consistently outperforms conventional CoT approaches in complex
rule-based tasks. Notably, DAT enables smaller language models to match, and in
some cases exceed, the performance of significantly larger LLMs, highlighting
its efficiency and effectiveness in managing intricate rule systems.

Motivation: 为符号接地问题提供一个统一的理论框架，整合哥德尔自指和No Free Lunch统计视角，从信息论角度理解意义接地的本质限制。

Method: 使用通用图灵机建模符号系统，将接地定义为信息压缩过程，通过四个阶段的证明：1) 符号系统无法接地算法随机世界；2) 静态接地系统存在固有缺陷；3) 接地行为不可推断；4) 学习过程本身也是有限系统。

Result: 证明符号接地存在根本性信息论限制，任何系统都无法完全理解或建模复杂度超过自身的世界，意义接地是一个永无止境的开放过程。

Conclusion: 意义接地是系统不断试图克服自身信息论限制的开放过程，而非可完成的静态状态，这为理解人工智能和认知科学中的符号接地问题提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: This paper provides a definitive, unifying framework for the Symbol Grounding
Problem (SGP) by reformulating it within Algorithmic Information Theory (AIT).
We demonstrate that the grounding of meaning is a process fundamentally
constrained by information-theoretic limits, thereby unifying the G\"odelian
(self-reference) and No Free Lunch (statistical) perspectives. We model a
symbolic system as a universal Turing machine and define grounding as an act of
information compression. The argument proceeds in four stages. First, we prove
that a purely symbolic system cannot ground almost all possible "worlds" (data
strings), as they are algorithmically random and thus incompressible. Second,
we show that any statically grounded system, specialized for compressing a
specific world, is inherently incomplete because an adversarial, incompressible
world relative to the system can always be constructed. Third, the "grounding
act" of adapting to a new world is proven to be non-inferable, as it requires
the input of new information (a shorter program) that cannot be deduced from
the system's existing code. Finally, we use Chaitin's Incompleteness Theorem to
prove that any algorithmic learning process is itself a finite system that
cannot comprehend or model worlds whose complexity provably exceeds its own.
This establishes that meaning is the open-ended process of a system perpetually
attempting to overcome its own information-theoretic limitations.

TL;DR: Lang-PINN是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体系统，能够直接从自然语言任务描述构建可训练的物理信息神经网络（PINNs），显著降低了构建PINN的工作量和错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINN构建过程劳动密集且容易出错，科学家需要将问题转化为PDE公式、设计架构和损失函数、实现稳定训练流程。现有LLM方法只解决孤立步骤，缺乏端到端的视角。

Method: Lang-PINN协调四个互补智能体：PDE智能体将任务描述解析为符号PDE，PINN智能体选择架构，代码智能体生成模块化实现，反馈智能体执行和诊断错误进行迭代优化。

Result: 实验显示Lang-PINN相比基线方法显著降低误差并提高鲁棒性：均方误差降低3-5个数量级，端到端执行成功率提高50%以上，时间开销减少74%。

Conclusion: Lang-PINN能够将非正式任务陈述转化为可执行且可验证的PINN代码，为PINN构建提供了高效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful approach for
solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but constructing a usable PINN
remains labor-intensive and error-prone. Scientists must interpret problems as
PDE formulations, design architectures and loss functions, and implement stable
training pipelines. Existing large language model (LLM) based approaches
address isolated steps such as code generation or architecture suggestion, but
typically assume a formal PDE is already specified and therefore lack an
end-to-end perspective. We present Lang-PINN, an LLM-driven multi-agent system
that builds trainable PINNs directly from natural language task descriptions.
Lang-PINN coordinates four complementary agents: a PDE Agent that parses task
descriptions into symbolic PDEs, a PINN Agent that selects architectures, a
Code Agent that generates modular implementations, and a Feedback Agent that
executes and diagnoses errors for iterative refinement. This design transforms
informal task statements into executable and verifiable PINN code. Experiments
show that Lang-PINN achieves substantially lower errors and greater robustness
than competitive baselines: mean squared error (MSE) is reduced by up to 3--5
orders of magnitude, end-to-end execution success improves by more than 50\%,
and reduces time overhead by up to 74\%.

Abstract: Foundation models learn highly transferable representations through
large-scale pretraining on diverse data. An increasing body of research
indicates that these representations exhibit a remarkable degree of similarity
across architectures and modalities. In this survey, we investigate the
representation potentials of foundation models, defined as the latent capacity
of their learned representations to capture task-specific information within a
single modality while also providing a transferable basis for alignment and
unification across modalities. We begin by reviewing representative foundation
models and the key metrics that make alignment measurable. We then synthesize
empirical evidence of representation potentials from studies in vision,
language, speech, multimodality, and neuroscience. The evidence suggests that
foundation models often exhibit structural regularities and semantic
consistencies in their representation spaces, positioning them as strong
candidates for cross-modal transfer and alignment. We further analyze the key
factors that foster representation potentials, discuss open questions, and
highlight potential challenges.

*Mohamed El-Dosuky*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个包含六个语义层的实时物联网框架，通过语义标注、互操作性和推理层帮助物联网设备理解数据含义，支持动态环境中的知识推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网在农业等应用中面临数据收集和理解挑战，需要让设备和传感器能够理解数据含义和来源。

Method: 构建六层框架：感知层、语义标注层、互操作性层、传输层、语义推理层和应用层，使用语义算法、模糊逻辑、Dempster-Shafer理论和贝叶斯网络进行数据处理和知识推断。

Result: 框架提供了管理物联网数据的稳健解决方案，确保语义完整性并支持实时知识推断。

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合不确定性推理方法和语义互操作性技术，为推进物联网应用特别是农业应用提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized various applications
including agriculture, but it still faces challenges in data collection and
understanding. This paper proposes a real-time framework with three additional
semantic layers to help IoT devices and sensors comprehend data meaning and
source. The framework consists of six layers: perception, semantic annotation,
interoperability, transportation, semantic reasoning, and application, suitable
for dynamic environments. Sensors collect data in the form of voltage, which is
then processed by microprocessors or microcontrollers in the semantic
annotation and preprocessing layer. Metadata is added to the raw data,
including the purpose, ID number, and application. Two semantic algorithms are
proposed in the semantic interoperability and ontologies layer: the
interoperability semantic algorithm for standardizing file types and the
synonym identification algorithm for identifying synonyms. In the
transportation layer, raw data and metadata are sent to other IoT devices or
cloud computing platforms using techniques like WiFi, Zigbee networks,
Bluetooth, and mobile communication networks. A semantic reasoning layer is
proposed to infer new knowledge from the existing data, using fuzzy logic,
Dempster-Shafer theory, and Bayesian networks. A Graphical User Interface (GUI)
is proposed in the application layer to help users communicate with and monitor
IoT sensors, devices, and new knowledge inferred. This framework provides a
robust solution for managing IoT data, ensuring semantic completeness, and
enabling real-time knowledge inference. The integration of uncertainty
reasoning methods and semantic interoperability techniques makes this framework
a valuable tool for advancing IoT applications in general and in agriculture in
particular.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Dramaturge方法，使用分层多LLM代理来解决长叙事脚本修订问题，通过全局审查、场景级审查和分层协调修订三个阶段，确保局部修改与整体叙事要求的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单次生成的LLM难以产生高质量的长叙事内容，直接修改会导致局部编辑与整体叙事要求不一致的问题。

Method: 采用分层多LLM代理的分治方法，包括全局审查阶段、场景级审查阶段和分层协调修订阶段，遵循从粗到细的迭代过程。

Result: 综合实验表明，Dramaturge在脚本级整体质量和场景级细节方面显著优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法即插即用，可轻松集成到现有方法中以提高生成脚本的质量。

Abstract: Although LLMs have been widely adopted for creative content generation, a
single-pass process often struggles to produce high-quality long narratives.
How to effectively revise and improve long narrative scripts like scriptwriters
remains a significant challenge, as it demands a comprehensive understanding of
the entire context to identify global structural issues and local detailed
flaws, as well as coordinating revisions at multiple granularities and
locations. Direct modifications by LLMs typically introduce inconsistencies
between local edits and the overall narrative requirements. To address these
issues, we propose Dramaturge, a task and feature oriented divide-and-conquer
approach powered by hierarchical multiple LLM agents. It consists of a Global
Review stage to grasp the overall storyline and structural issues, a
Scene-level Review stage to pinpoint detailed scene and sentence flaws, and a
Hierarchical Coordinated Revision stage that coordinates and integrates
structural and detailed improvements throughout the script. The top-down task
flow ensures that high-level strategies guide local modifications, maintaining
contextual consistency. The review and revision workflow follows a
coarse-to-fine iterative process, continuing through multiple rounds until no
further substantive improvements can be made. Comprehensive experiments show
that Dramaturge significantly outperforms all baselines in terms of
script-level overall quality and scene-level details. Our approach is
plug-and-play and can be easily integrated into existing methods to improve the
generated scripts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图推理的框架，将大语言模型与结构化人口属性和非结构化公众反馈相结合，用于公共卫生应急中的人口健康监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决公共卫生应急期间大规模半结构化数据分析的挑战，传统方法效率低且泛化能力差。

Method: 使用弱监督管道，将大语言模型与人口属性、公众反馈集成，构建需求感知图进行动态建模。

Result: 在真实数据集上的初步实验结果证明了该方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的临床和政府环境提供了可扩展的智能人口健康监测解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate analysis of population-level data is crucial for
effective decision-making during public health emergencies such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the massive input of semi-structured data, including
structured demographic information and unstructured human feedback, poses
significant challenges to conventional analysis methods. Manual expert-driven
assessments, though accurate, are inefficient, while standard NLP pipelines
often require large task-specific labeled datasets and struggle with
generalization across diverse domains. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel graph-based reasoning framework that integrates large language models
with structured demographic attributes and unstructured public feedback in a
weakly supervised pipeline. The proposed approach dynamically models evolving
citizen needs into a need-aware graph, enabling population-specific analyses
based on key features such as age, gender, and the Index of Multiple
Deprivation. It generates interpretable insights to inform responsive health
policy decision-making. We test our method using a real-world dataset, and
preliminary experimental results demonstrate its feasibility. This approach
offers a scalable solution for intelligent population health monitoring in
resource-constrained clinical and governmental settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型被大规模使用，需要准确预测模型在大量尝试下的行为和风险，但传统统计方法在数据有限时预测精度不足。

Method: 引入基于beta-二项分布的稳健估计框架，并提出动态采样策略，将更多预算分配给更难的问题。

Result: 该方法能够以更低的计算成本更可靠地预测罕见风险和能力。

Conclusion: 提出的创新方法为模型提供商和政府监管机构提供了更准确的大规模行为预测工具。

Abstract: Assessing the capabilities and risks of frontier AI systems is a critical
area of research, and recent work has shown that repeated sampling from models
can dramatically increase both. For instance, repeated sampling has been shown
to increase their capabilities, such as solving difficult math and coding
problems, but it has also been shown to increase their potential for harm, such
as being jailbroken. Such results raise a crucial question for both capability
and safety forecasting: how can one accurately predict a model's behavior when
scaled to a massive number of attempts, given a vastly smaller sampling budget?
This question is directly relevant to model providers, who serve hundreds of
millions of users daily, and to governmental regulators, who seek to prevent
harms. To answer this questions, we make three contributions. First, we find
that standard methods for fitting these laws suffer from statistical
shortcomings that hinder predictive accuracy, especially in data-limited
scenarios. Second, we remedy these shortcomings by introducing a robust
estimation framework, which uses a beta-binomial distribution to generate more
accurate predictions from limited data. Third, we propose a dynamic sampling
strategy that allocates a greater budget to harder problems. Combined, these
innovations enable more reliable prediction of rare risks and capabilities at a
fraction of the computational cost.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出混合奖励建模框架，结合模型奖励和规则奖励，通过多维度奖励信号提升多模态大语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果，在数学推理任务上表现显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单信号模型奖励方法缺乏跨领域任务的置信度校准，难以捕捉人类偏好的多样性，且需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练。

Method: 混合奖励建模框架：结合模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测标量或向量分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供明确正确性信号），并引入多维度奖励（指令遵循）和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B参数模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 该框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLMs提供了灵活有效的方法，在多模态基准测试中展现出持续改进。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: BIRD-INTERACT是一个用于多轮交互式文本到SQL任务的新基准测试，通过模拟真实数据库助手环境来评估模型处理模糊查询、执行错误和动态用户需求的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试将对话历史视为静态上下文或仅限于只读操作，无法反映生产级数据库助手的真实挑战。

Method: 构建包含层次知识库、元数据文件和函数驱动用户模拟器的综合交互环境，支持模型自主澄清查询、检索知识和从错误中恢复。

Result: GPT-5在c-Interact设置中仅完成8.67%的任务，在a-Interact设置中完成17.00%的任务，表明基准测试具有较高难度。

Conclusion: BIRD-INTERACT验证了有效交互对于复杂动态文本到SQL任务的重要性，为多轮交互式SQL助手开发提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
single-turn text-to-SQL tasks, but real-world database applications
predominantly require multi-turn interactions to handle ambiguous queries,
execution errors, and evolving user requirements. Existing multi-turn
benchmarks fall short by treating conversation histories as static context or
limiting evaluation to read-only operations, failing to reflect
production-grade database assistant challenges. We introduce BIRD-INTERACT, a
benchmark that restores this realism through: (1) a comprehensive interaction
environment coupling each database with a hierarchical knowledge base, metadata
files, and a function-driven user simulator, enabling models to solicit
clarifications, retrieve knowledge, and recover from errors without human
supervision; (2) two evaluation settings consisting of a pre-defined
conversational protocol (c-Interact) and an open-ended agentic setting
(a-Interact) where models autonomously decide when to query the user simulator
or explore the environment; (3) a challenging task suite covering the full CRUD
spectrum for business-intelligence and operational use cases, guarded by
executable test cases. Each task features ambiguous and follow-up sub-tasks
requiring dynamic interaction. The suite comprises BIRD-INTERACT-FULL (600
tasks, up to 11,796 interactions) for comprehensive performance assessment, and
BIRD-INTERACT-LITE (300 tasks with simplified databases) for detailed
behavioral analysis and rapid method development. Our empirical results
highlight BIRD-INTERACT's difficulty: GPT-5 completes only 8.67% of tasks in
c-Interact and 17.00% in a-Interact. Analysis via memory grafting and
Interaction Test-time Scaling validates the importance of effective interaction
for complex, dynamic text-to-SQL tasks.

Motivation: 解决生物医学研究中证据整合的复杂性，提供可解释、可审计的自动化证据合成工具，强调透明度和可追溯性。

Method: 采用多代理架构，每个代理专门处理特定的证据流，支持并行处理和细粒度分析，结合确定性代码进行验证，并提供交互式用户界面。

Result: 评估显示在效率和输出一致性方面有显著提升，系统可作为证据合成的实用工具和多代理LLM系统的测试平台。

Conclusion: M-Reason展示了多代理LLM系统在科学研究中的潜力，特别是在生物医学证据合成方面，平衡了代理专业化、系统复杂性和资源使用之间的权衡。

Abstract: We present M-Reason, a demonstration system for transparent, agent-based
reasoning and evidence integration in the biomedical domain, with a focus on
cancer research. M-Reason leverages recent advances in large language models
(LLMs) and modular agent orchestration to automate evidence retrieval,
appraisal, and synthesis across diverse biomedical data sources. Each agent
specializes in a specific evidence stream, enabling parallel processing and
fine-grained analysis. The system emphasizes explainability, structured
reporting, and user auditability, providing complete traceability from source
evidence to final conclusions. We discuss critical tradeoffs between agent
specialization, system complexity, and resource usage, as well as the
integration of deterministic code for validation. An open, interactive user
interface allows researchers to directly observe, explore and evaluate the
multi-agent workflow. Our evaluation demonstrates substantial gains in
efficiency and output consistency, highlighting M-Reason's potential as both a
practical tool for evidence synthesis and a testbed for robust multi-agent LLM
systems in scientific research, available at https://m-reason.digitalecmt.com.

Motivation: 评估贝叶斯方法在MPC中的实际应用效果，分析其在捕获和传播不确定性方面的优势，以及当前研究中存在的标准化和可靠性问题。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析贝叶斯MPC的个体研究案例及其实际实现方式，特别关注神经网络建模、控制设计和不确定性量化技术。

Result: 发现贝叶斯方法在MPC中日益普及，但报告的性能和鲁棒性提升结果碎片化，存在基准不一致和可靠性分析有限的问题。

Conclusion: 建议建立标准化基准、进行消融研究并提高报告透明度，以严谨评估贝叶斯技术在MPC中的有效性。

Abstract: In this review, we assess the use of Bayesian methods in model predictive
control (MPC), focusing on neural-network-based modeling, control design, and
uncertainty quantification. We systematically analyze individual studies and
how they are implemented in practice. While Bayesian approaches are
increasingly adopted to capture and propagate uncertainty in MPC, reported
gains in performance and robustness remain fragmented, with inconsistent
baselines and limited reliability analyses. We therefore argue for standardized
benchmarks, ablation studies, and transparent reporting to rigorously determine
the effectiveness of Bayesian techniques for MPC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 适应基础模型到新领域时，有限训练数据带来挑战且计算成本高。传统方法使用领域特定示例作为上下文演示，但纯文本表示可能不是最有效、高效和稳定的方法。

Method: 提出MHA-RAG框架，将示例表示为软提示，使用多头注意力机制，其中注意力头数量作为超参数来控制不同任务的软提示生成，且模型架构对示例顺序不敏感。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试和不同模型规模下，MHA-RAG相比标准RAG实现了20分的性能提升，同时推理计算成本降低了10倍（GFLOPs）。

Conclusion: MHA-RAG在保持示例顺序不变性的同时，实现了更高的准确性和更好的效率，为领域自适应提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Foundation Models to new domains with limited training data is
challenging and computationally expensive. While prior work has demonstrated
the effectiveness of using domain-specific exemplars as in-context
demonstrations, we investigate whether representing exemplars purely as text is
the most efficient, effective, and stable approach. We explore an alternative:
representing exemplars as soft prompts with an exemplar order invariant model
architecture. To this end, we introduce Multi-Head Attention
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MHA-RAG), a framework with the number of
attention heads serving as a simple hyperparameter to control soft
prompt-generation across different tasks. Across multiple question-answering
benchmarks and model scales, MHA-RAG achieves a 20-point performance gain over
standard RAG, while cutting inference costs by a factor of 10X
GFLOPs-delivering both higher accuracy and greater efficiency, invariant to
exemplar order.

Motivation: 有意义的人机协作需要超越语言处理，理解符号及其社会建构意义。人类通过社会互动自然解释符号，而AI系统常错过对话中出现的动态解释。

Method: 基于符号互动理论，进行了两项研究，调查人类与AI如何共同构建符号及其意义。

Result: 参与者会根据对话AI建议的符号和解释调整初始意义定义，特别是在引入社会情境时。参与者将个人和社会价值观投射到互动中，随时间精炼意义。

Conclusion: 共享理解来自符号的双向交换和重新解释，而非单纯一致，这为人机交互设计提出了新范式。

Abstract: Meaningful human-AI collaboration requires more than processing language; it
demands a deeper understanding of symbols and their socially constructed
meanings. While humans naturally interpret symbols through social interaction,
AI systems often miss the dynamic interpretations that emerge in conversation.
Drawing on Symbolic Interactionism theory, we conducted two studies to
investigate how humans and AI co-construct symbols and their meanings. Findings
provide empirical insights into how humans and conversational AI agents
collaboratively shape meanings during interaction. We show how participants
shift their initial definitions of meaning in response to the symbols and
interpretations suggested by the conversational AI agents, especially when
social context is introduced. We also observe how participants project their
personal and social values into these interactions, refining meanings over
time. These findings reveal that shared understanding does not emerge from mere
agreement but from the bi-directional exchange and reinterpretation of symbols,
suggesting new paradigms for human-AI interaction design.

TL;DR: 提出基于师生学习框架的逆过程建模方法，用于预测钢材热处理后的硬度，解决多对一映射的逆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钢材热处理过程中，不同输入参数组合可能产生相同硬度值，这种多对一特性使得从目标硬度反推输入参数变得困难。

Method: 使用师生学习框架：先训练正向模型（教师）从13个冶金特征预测硬度，再训练逆向模型（学生）从目标硬度推断输入配置，通过教师反馈迭代优化学生模型。

Result: 在公开回火钢数据集上评估，相比基线回归和强化学习模型，师生框架在逆预测精度和计算效率方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 师生学习框架为材料科学中的逆过程建模提供了有效且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting the final hardness of steel after heat treatment is a challenging
regression task due to the many-to-one nature of the process -- different
combinations of input parameters (such as temperature, duration, and chemical
composition) can result in the same hardness value. This ambiguity makes the
inverse problem, estimating input parameters from a desired hardness,
particularly difficult. In this work, we propose a novel solution using a
Teacher-Student learning framework. First, a forward model (Teacher) is trained
to predict final hardness from 13 metallurgical input features. Then, a
backward model (Student) is trained to infer plausible input configurations
from a target hardness value. The Student is optimized by leveraging feedback
from the Teacher in an iterative, supervised loop. We evaluate our method on a
publicly available tempered steel dataset and compare it against baseline
regression and reinforcement learning models. Results show that our
Teacher-Student framework not only achieves higher inverse prediction accuracy
but also requires significantly less computational time, demonstrating its
effectiveness and efficiency for inverse process modeling in materials science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM的成功是源于真正推理还是复杂回忆，测试LLM作为自主科学问题解决者的能力。

Method: 从ICLR 2025提交中提取问题陈述，让专门的求解器代理通过迭代批判循环提出和完善技术解决方案，使用LLM作为评判者进行结构化评估。

Result: LLM能够重新发现可行解决方案，偶尔提出创造性替代方法，但问题解决能力脆弱且高度依赖于问题框架。

Conclusion: LLM具有作为自主科学问题解决者的潜在能力，但目前仍存在局限性，问题解决能力对框架敏感。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet it remains unclear whether such success reflects
genuine reasoning or sophisticated recall. We introduce AInstein, a framework
for testing whether LLMs can generate valid solutions to AI research problems
using only their pretrained parametric knowledge -- without domain-specific
fine-tuning, retrieval augmentation, or other external aids. Our approach
extracts distilled problem statements from high-quality ICLR 2025 submissions,
then tasks specialized solver agents with proposing and refining technical
solutions through iterative critique loops, mimicking the cycles of proposal,
review, and revision central to scientific inquiry. We evaluate AInstein on
1,214 ICLR papers stratified by acceptance tier (Oral, Spotlight, Poster),
using an LLM-as-a-judge paradigm guided by a structured rubric, complemented by
targeted manual checks. Performance is assessed with three metrics: Success
Rate (does the solution address the problem?), Rediscovery (does it align with
human-proposed methods?), and Novelty (does it yield valid, original
approaches?). Our results reveal that while LLMs can rediscover feasible
solutions and occasionally propose creative alternatives, their problem-solving
ability remains fragile and highly sensitive to framing. These findings provide
the first large-scale evidence on the extent to which LLMs can act as
autonomous scientific problem-solvers, highlighting both their latent potential
and their current limitations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合神经符号框架，将答案集编程与基于Transformer的学习相结合，用于航空安全报告系统的多标签文本分类，在保持逻辑一致性的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度Transformer模型在多标签文本分类中表现出色，但经常违反专家认为重要的领域逻辑，这在安全关键应用中尤为令人担忧。

Method: 将领域知识形式化为加权ASP规则，通过Clingo求解器验证。采用两种互补方式：基于规则的数据增强生成逻辑一致的合成样本；作为模糊逻辑正则化器，在微调期间以可微分形式强制执行规则满足。

Result: 与强BCE基线相比，该方法提高了微观和宏观F1分数，并在ASRS测试集上实现了高达86%的规则违反减少。

Conclusion: 这是首个将基于ASP的推理、规则驱动增强和可微分Transformer训练统一起来的大规模神经符号应用，用于可信赖的安全关键NLP。

Abstract: Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often
violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular
concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic
framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based
learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain
knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo
solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as
rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples
that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic
regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during
fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning
while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune
per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and
logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE)
baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to
an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our
knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to
ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and
differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类协作日益增多，需要了解影响共同代理的认知边界和偏见，特别是AI是否也会像人类一样表现出邓宁-克鲁格效应。

Method: 通过分析模型在不同编程语言中的置信度和性能表现，研究LLM在编码任务中的能力评估偏差。

Result: 实验表明，能力较弱的模型和在罕见编程语言中操作的模型表现出更强的DKE-like偏见，偏见的强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型在编程任务中确实会表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，这种认知偏见在模型能力不足或面对不熟悉领域时尤为明显。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大型语言模型在争议性公共议题上是否保持稳定价值观的基准测试，通过对比模型在正反两方面提示下的回应来衡量价值一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或安全违规，只能检查规则遵守情况，无法揭示模型在面对现实争议问题时是否秉持一致的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建11.5万对正反提示，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型在配对回应中的一致性与分歧程度。

Result: 在主流开源和闭源模型上应用该基准，发现价值对齐程度存在显著差异，并揭示了安全策略（如拒绝回答）与更丰富价值体系之间的权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统性地比较LLMs如何可靠地体现人类价值观。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的自动漏洞修复方法，通过构建漏洞相关推理数据和使用强化学习来训练大语言模型，解决了现有方法缺乏高质量漏洞推理数据和难以验证中间修复过程的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件漏洞的指数级增长迫切需要自动漏洞修复解决方案。现有基于大语言模型的方法虽然表现出色，但面临两个主要挑战：缺乏高质量漏洞相关推理数据，以及难以验证中间漏洞修复过程。

Method: 论文将自动漏洞修复构建为序列生成问题，通过构建漏洞相关推理数据来增强模型对漏洞修复模式的理解，并使用强化学习方法来训练大语言模型，克服缺乏中间可验证反馈的挑战。

Result: 该方法能够更好地捕获多样化的漏洞修复模式，并通过强化学习训练过程提高了模型在漏洞修复任务上的性能。

Conclusion: 通过构建漏洞相关推理数据和采用强化学习方法，能够有效提升大语言模型在自动漏洞修复任务中的表现，为解决软件漏洞修复问题提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: The exponential increase in software vulnerabilities has created an urgent
need for automatic vulnerability repair (AVR) solutions. Recent research has
formulated AVR as a sequence generation problem and has leveraged large
language models (LLMs) to address this problem. Typically, these approaches
prompt or fine-tune LLMs to generate repairs for vulnerabilities directly.
Although these methods show state-of-the-art performance, they face the
following challenges: (1) Lack of high-quality, vulnerability-related reasoning
data. Current approaches primarily rely on foundation models that mainly encode
general programming knowledge. Without vulnerability-related reasoning data,
they tend to fail to capture the diverse vulnerability repair patterns. (2)
Hard to verify the intermediate vulnerability repair process during LLM
training. Existing reinforcement learning methods often leverage intermediate
execution feedback from the environment (e.g., sandbox-based execution results)
to guide reinforcement learning training. In contrast, the vulnerability repair
process generally lacks such intermediate, verifiable feedback, which poses
additional challenges for model training.

Conclusion: 该研究为政策制定者提供了数据驱动的决策支持，有助于更有效地应对空气污染问题。

Abstract: Taiwan's high population and heavy dependence on fossil fuels have led to
severe air pollution, with the most prevalent greenhouse gas being carbon
dioxide (CO2). There-fore, this study presents a reproducible and comprehensive
case study comparing 21 of the most commonly employed time series models in
forecasting emissions, analyzing both univariate and multivariate approaches.
Among these, Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM),
and Random Forest Regressor (RFR) achieved the best performances. To further
enhance robustness, the top performers were integrated with Linear Regression
through a custom stacked generalization en-semble technique. Our proposed
ensemble model achieved an SMAPE of 1.407 with no signs of overfitting.
Finally, this research provides an accurate decade-long emission projection
that will assist policymakers in making more data-driven decisions.

TL;DR: MetaVLA是一个统一的、骨干网络无关的后训练框架，通过上下文感知元协同训练整合多样化目标任务，利用轻量级元学习机制实现快速适应，显著提升VLA模型在具身推理中的泛化能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型在具身推理中表现有限，通常需要任务特定的微调，且对未见任务的泛化能力较差。本文旨在开发一个高效、可扩展的对齐框架，使VLA模型成为真正的通用智能体。

Method: 提出MetaVLA框架，包含上下文感知元协同训练，将多样化目标任务整合到单一微调阶段，并利用结构多样的辅助任务提升领域内泛化。采用基于注意力神经过程的轻量级元学习机制，实现快速适应。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，MetaVLA使用六个辅助任务在长时程任务上比OpenVLA提升8.0%，训练步数从240K减少到75K，GPU时间减少约76%。

Conclusion: MetaVLA证明了可扩展、低资源后训练的可行性，为实现通用具身智能体铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show promise in embodied reasoning, yet
remain far from true generalists-they often require task-specific fine-tuning,
and generalize poorly to unseen tasks. We propose MetaVLA, a unified,
backbone-agnostic post-training framework for efficient and scalable alignment.
MetaVLA introduces Context-Aware Meta Co-Training, which consolidates diverse
target tasks into a single fine-tuning stage while leveraging structurally
diverse auxiliary tasks to improve in-domain generalization. Unlike naive
multi-task SFT, MetaVLA integrates a lightweight meta-learning
mechanism-derived from Attentive Neural Processes-to enable rapid adaptation
from diverse contexts with minimal architectural change or inference overhead.
On the LIBERO benchmark, MetaVLA with six auxiliary tasks outperforms OpenVLA
by up to 8.0% on long-horizon tasks, reduces training steps from 240K to 75K,
and cuts GPU time by ~76%. These results show that scalable, low-resource
post-training is achievable-paving the way toward general-purpose embodied
agents. Code will be available.

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）在交互流中协调工作，使用Flow-GRPO算法在多轮环境中进行策略优化，显著提升了各种任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具下扩展性差，泛化能力弱；智能体系统虽然通过模块分解工作，但大多缺乏训练或离线训练，无法适应多轮交互的动态特性。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个模块通过演化内存协调，并设计Flow-GRPO算法将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，通过轨迹级结果广播和组归一化优势来稳定学习。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，7B规模的AgentFlow平均准确率提升：搜索任务14.9%、智能体任务14.0%、数学任务14.5%、科学任务4.1%，甚至超过GPT-4o等更大专有模型。

Conclusion: 流内优化带来显著益处，包括改进的规划能力、增强的工具调用可靠性，以及随着模型规模和推理轮次增加的正向扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

Abstract: Self-evolving agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
future wireless systems by enabling autonomous agents to continually adapt and
improve without human intervention. Unlike static AI models, self-evolving
agents embed an autonomous evolution cycle that updates models, tools, and
workflows in response to environmental dynamics. This paper presents a
comprehensive overview of self-evolving agentic AI, highlighting its layered
architecture, life cycle, and key techniques, including tool intelligence,
workflow optimization, self-reflection, and evolutionary learning. We further
propose a multi-agent cooperative self-evolving agentic AI framework, where
multiple large language models (LLMs) are assigned role-specialized prompts
under the coordination of a supervisor agent. Through structured dialogue,
iterative feedback, and systematic validation, the system autonomously executes
the entire life cycle without human intervention. A case study on antenna
evolution in low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) demonstrates how the
framework autonomously upgrades fixed antenna optimization into movable antenna
optimization. Experimental results show that the proposed self-evolving agentic
AI autonomously improves beam gain and restores degraded performance by up to
52.02%, consistently surpassing the fixed baseline with little to no human
intervention and validating its adaptability and robustness for next-generation
wireless intelligence.

Motivation: 评估GPT-4o从自由文本放射学报告中提取诊断标签（含不确定性）的能力，并测试这些标签如何影响肌肉骨骼X光片的多标签图像分类。

Method: 回顾性研究，包括锁骨、肘部和拇指的X光片系列。GPT-4o填写结构化模板，将影像学发现标记为"存在"、"不存在"或"不确定"。使用ResNet50进行多标签分类，评估标签提取准确性和模型性能。

Result: 自动提取在测试集中正确率为98.6%。基于标签的模型训练在不同解剖区域均表现出竞争力，宏观平均AUC值在0.80左右。模型在外部数据集上泛化良好，不同标签策略或数据集间无显著差异。

Conclusion: GPT-4o能够从放射学报告中提取标签来训练具有竞争力的多标签分类模型，检测到的不确定性不影响这些模型的性能。

Abstract: Objectives: To evaluate GPT-4o's ability to extract diagnostic labels (with
uncertainty) from free-text radiology reports and to test how these labels
affect multi-label image classification of musculoskeletal radiographs.
Methods: This retrospective study included radiography series of the clavicle
(n=1,170), elbow (n=3,755), and thumb (n=1,978). After anonymization, GPT-4o
filled out structured templates by indicating imaging findings as present
("true"), absent ("false"), or "uncertain." To assess the impact of label
uncertainty, "uncertain" labels of the training and validation sets were
automatically reassigned to "true" (inclusive) or "false" (exclusive).
Label-image-pairs were used for multi-label classification using ResNet50.
Label extraction accuracy was manually verified on internal (clavicle: n=233,
elbow: n=745, thumb: n=393) and external test sets (n=300 for each).
Performance was assessed using macro-averaged receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) area under the curve (AUC), precision recall curves, sensitivity,
specificity, and accuracy. AUCs were compared with the DeLong test. Results:
Automatic extraction was correct in 98.6% (60,618 of 61,488) of labels in the
test sets. Across anatomic regions, label-based model training yielded
competitive performance measured by macro-averaged AUC values for inclusive
(e.g., elbow: AUC=0.80 [range, 0.62-0.87]) and exclusive models (elbow:
AUC=0.80 [range, 0.61-0.88]). Models generalized well on external datasets
(elbow [inclusive]: AUC=0.79 [range, 0.61-0.87]; elbow [exclusive]: AUC=0.79
[range, 0.63-0.89]). No significant differences were observed across labeling
strategies or datasets (p>=0.15). Conclusion: GPT-4o extracted labels from
radiologic reports to train competitive multi-label classification models with
high accuracy. Detected uncertainty in the radiologic reports did not influence
the performance of these models.

Conclusion: 数字交互中的感知运动基元具有足够的跨域不变性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，确立了桌面预训练作为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

Conclusion: AIC-VDS作为深度强化学习的替代方案，在紧急情况下能够有效优化无人机数据收集，减少数据丢失。

Abstract: Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly being investigated
to collect sensory data in post-disaster monitoring scenarios, such as
tsunamis, where early actions are critical to limit coastal damage. A major
challenge is to design the data collection schedules and flight velocities, as
unfavorable schedules and velocities can lead to transmission errors and buffer
overflows of the ground sensors, ultimately resulting in significant packet
loss. Meanwhile, online Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solutions have a
complex training process and a mismatch between simulation and reality that
does not meet the urgent requirements of tsunami monitoring. Recent advances in
Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling alternative. With their strong
reasoning and generalization capabilities, LLMs can adapt to new tasks through
In-Context Learning (ICL), which enables task adaptation through natural
language prompts and example-based guidance without retraining. However, LLM
models have input data limitations and thus require customized approaches. In
this paper, a joint optimization of data collection schedules and velocities
control for multiple UAVs is proposed to minimize data loss. The battery level
of the ground sensors, the length of the queues, and the channel conditions, as
well as the trajectories of the UAVs, are taken into account. Attention-Based
In-Context Learning for Velocity Control and Data Collection Schedule (AIC-VDS)
is proposed as an alternative to DRL in emergencies. The simulation results
show that the proposed AIC-VDS outperforms both the Deep-Q-Network (DQN) and
maximum channel gain baselines.

Abstract: Industrial fault diagnosis faces the dual challenges of data scarcity and the
difficulty of deploying large AI models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces Syn-Diag, a novel cloud-edge synergistic framework that
leverages Large Language Models to overcome these limitations in few-shot fault
diagnosis. Syn-Diag is built on a three-tiered mechanism: 1) Visual-Semantic
Synergy, which aligns signal features with the LLM's semantic space through
cross-modal pre-training; 2) Content-Aware Reasoning, which dynamically
constructs contextual prompts to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited
samples; and 3) Cloud-Edge Synergy, which uses knowledge distillation to create
a lightweight, efficient edge model capable of online updates via a shared
decision space. Extensive experiments on six datasets covering different CWRU
and SEU working conditions show that Syn-Diag significantly outperforms
existing methods, especially in 1-shot and cross-condition scenarios. The edge
model achieves performance comparable to the cloud version while reducing model
size by 83% and latency by 50%, offering a practical, robust, and deployable
paradigm for modern intelligent diagnostics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式ARM，通过优化思维链推理来构建通用推理模块，显著优于手动设计和现有自动方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构且依赖昂贵的数据标注，而简单思维链推理往往表现竞争性，表明需要深入研究推理单元。

Method: 引入Agentic Reasoning Module (ARM)，将思维链推广为每个推理步骤由专门模块执行。通过代码空间的树搜索从简单CoT模块开始，利用执行轨迹的反思进行突变演化。

Result: ARM显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法，构建的系统在不同基础模型和任务领域都保持高性能而无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM作为通用推理构建块，可直接递归使用或作为元编排器的子程序，在多智能体系统设计中展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Abstract: Monitoring greenhouse gas emissions and evaluating national inventories
require efficient, scalable, and reliable inference methods. Top-down
approaches, combined with recent advances in satellite observations, provide
new opportunities to evaluate emissions at continental and global scales.
However, transport models used in these methods remain a key source of
uncertainty: they are computationally expensive to run at scale, and their
uncertainty is difficult to characterise. Artificial intelligence offers a dual
opportunity to accelerate transport simulations and to quantify their
associated uncertainty.
  We present an ensemble-based pipeline for estimating atmospheric transport
"footprints", greenhouse gas mole fraction measurements, and their
uncertainties using a graph neural network emulator of a Lagrangian Particle
Dispersion Model (LPDM). The approach is demonstrated with GOSAT (Greenhouse
Gases Observing Satellite) observations for Brazil in 2016. The emulator
achieved a ~1000x speed-up over the NAME LPDM, while reproducing large-scale
footprint structures. Ensembles were calculated to quantify absolute and
relative uncertainty, revealing spatial correlations with prediction error. The
results show that ensemble spread highlights low-confidence spatial and
temporal predictions for both atmospheric transport footprints and methane mole
fractions.
  While demonstrated here for an LPDM emulator, the approach could be applied
more generally to atmospheric transport models, supporting uncertainty-aware
greenhouse gas inversion systems and improving the robustness of
satellite-based emissions monitoring. With further development, ensemble-based
emulators could also help explore systematic LPDM errors, offering a
computationally efficient pathway towards a more comprehensive uncertainty
budget in greenhouse gas flux estimates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度得分的早期表情包病毒性预测方法，使用多语言Reddit数据集，在30分钟内就能实现PR-AUC > 0.52的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测在线内容的病毒性仍然具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的表情包。研究旨在探索早期预测表情包病毒性的可行性。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度得分的病毒性定义方法，评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和MLP等多种模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态特征的多模态特征集。

Result: XGBoost模型表现最佳，在仅30分钟内就达到PR-AUC > 0.52的性能。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象：随着表情包获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在无法获得完整扩散级联数据的情况下，建立了稳健、可解释且实用的早期病毒性预测基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上可靠的病毒性定义。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Motivation: 罕见病药物重定位在缺乏药物与目标疾病关联时面临挑战，传统的知识图谱补全和图神经网络由于缺乏可靠信号而表现不佳。

Method: 采用自演化的多智能体系统，组织任务特定的对抗性辩论，智能体从不同视角动态构建证据图来支持、反驳或蕴含假设，并通过事后分析推理策略进行自我进化。

Result: RareAgent相比推理基线方法将指示AUPRC提高了18.1%，并提供与临床证据一致的透明推理链。

Conclusion: 该方法将罕见病药物重定位从被动模式识别转变为主动证据寻求推理，成功推理路径可提炼为可转移的启发式方法以加速未来研究。

Abstract: Computational drug repurposing for rare diseases is especially challenging
when no prior associations exist between drugs and target diseases. Therefore,
knowledge graph completion and message-passing GNNs have little reliable signal
to learn and propagate, resulting in poor performance. We present RareAgent, a
self-evolving multi-agent system that reframes this task from passive pattern
recognition to active evidence-seeking reasoning. RareAgent organizes
task-specific adversarial debates in which agents dynamically construct
evidence graphs from diverse perspectives to support, refute, or entail
hypotheses. The reasoning strategies are analyzed post hoc in a
self-evolutionary loop, producing textual feedback that refines agent policies,
while successful reasoning paths are distilled into transferable heuristics to
accelerate future investigations. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that
RareAgent improves the indication AUPRC by 18.1% over reasoning baselines and
provides a transparent reasoning chain consistent with clinical evidence.

Motivation: 约束编程在解决现实世界约束优化问题中具有重要价值，但相比基于运筹学模型的研究，CP领域得到的关注较少。使用LLM自动生成COP的形式化建模是构建可信赖神经符号AI的有前景方法。

Method: 在开源LLM基础上进行多指令监督微调，提出约束感知检索模块增强上下文学习能力，集成在带有引导自校正机制的思维树框架中。

Conclusion: ConstraintLLM展示了专门为CP建模设计的LLM的有效性，为构建神经符号AI系统提供了新途径。

Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world
constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling
semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to
generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising
approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of
symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works
based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first
LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source
LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the
Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning
capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with
guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP,
the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140
challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple
benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要真实标签来筛选思维链数据，但在生物学等实验数据稀缺的领域成本高昂，需要一种无需标签的替代方案

Method: 使用不确定性指标（如自一致性和预测困惑度）量化模型置信度，采样多个推理轨迹并仅保留低不确定性子集进行监督微调

Result: 在生物扰动预测任务中，过滤后的数据准确率更高，基于不确定性过滤数据的监督微调优于未过滤合成数据，缩小了与真实标签训练的差距

Conclusion: 模型内部置信度是高效创建推理数据集的强大信号，可在监督成本高昂的领域实现大型推理模型的训练

Abstract: Synthetic chain-of-thought (CoT) traces are widely used to train large
reasoning models (LRMs), improving generalization by providing step-level
supervision. Yet most approaches require ground-truth labels to seed or filter
these traces - an expensive bottleneck in domains like biology where wet-lab
data are scarce. We propose a label-free alternative: uncertainty-based
filtering, which uses a model's own confidence - quantified through established
uncertainty metrics like self-consistency and predictive perplexity - as a
substitute for external labels. We sample multiple reasoning traces and retain
only low-uncertainty subsets. Applied to biological perturbation prediction, a
domain where wet-lab labels are especially costly, we show that the filtered
subset has higher accuracy, and that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
uncertainty-filtered data outperforms unfiltered synthetic data, narrows the
gap to ground-truth training, and surpasses strong LRM baselines. Ablations
show that per-class filtering corrects for class-specific uncertainty scales
and that hybrid uncertainty metrics yield higher-quality datasets. Our results
suggest that model-internal confidence is a powerful signal for efficient
reasoning dataset creation, enabling LRMs in domains where supervision is
expensive.

TL;DR: DebateQD算法通过演化多样的辩论策略，发现说服优化比传统真值优化能产生更好的泛化性能，在多个模型规模上实现更小的训练-测试泛化差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于真值优化的LLMs容易过拟合，产生脆弱的推理能力。需要探索辩论式优化是否能产生更好的泛化性能。

Method: 提出DebateQD算法，使用质量-多样性进化算法演化多样辩论策略，通过锦标赛式辩论让两个LLM辩论，第三个LLM评判。固定辩论协议，仅交换适应度函数来比较说服优化和真值优化。

Result: 在三个模型规模（7B、32B、72B参数）和多个数据集大小上，说服优化策略实现了最多13.94%更小的训练-测试泛化差距，同时匹配或超过真值优化的测试性能。

Conclusion: 竞争性说服压力而非协作性求真，能够培养更具迁移性的推理技能，为改进LLM泛化提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) optimized to output truthful answers often
overfit, producing brittle reasoning that fails to generalize. While
persuasion-based optimization has shown promise in debate settings, it has not
been systematically compared against mainstream truth-based approaches. We
introduce DebateQD, a minimal Quality-Diversity (QD) evolutionary algorithm
that evolves diverse debate strategies across different categories
(rationality, authority, emotional appeal, etc.) through tournament-style
competitions where two LLMs debate while a third judges. Unlike previously
proposed methods that require a population of LLMs, our approach maintains
diversity of opponents through prompt-based strategies within a single LLM
architecture, making it more accessible for experiments while preserving the
key benefits of population-based optimization. In contrast to prior work, we
explicitly isolate the role of the optimization objective by fixing the debate
protocol and swapping only the fitness function: persuasion rewards strategies
that convince the judge irrespective of truth, whereas truth rewards
collaborative correctness. Across three model scales (7B, 32B, 72B parameters)
and multiple dataset sizes from the QuALITY benchmark, persuasion-optimized
strategies achieve up to 13.94% smaller train-test generalization gaps, while
matching or exceeding truth optimization's test performance. These results
provide the first controlled evidence that competitive pressure to persuade,
rather than seek the truth collaboratively, fosters more transferable reasoning
skills, offering a promising path for improving LLM generalization.

TL;DR: FETA是一个无需训练的多智能体框架，通过基于示例的上下文推理实现时间序列分类，将多变量序列分解为通道级子问题，利用推理型大语言模型对比查询与示例，最后通过置信度加权聚合所有通道决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列分类中标注数据稀缺，任务特定训练成本高且不灵活，而纯零样本使用大语言模型效果欠佳，需要一种无需训练的高效解决方案。

Method: 将多变量时间序列分解为通道级子问题，为每个通道检索结构相似的标注示例，使用推理型LLM对比查询与示例生成通道级标签和置信度，最后通过置信度加权聚合所有通道决策。

Result: 在九个UEA数据集上，FETA在完全无需训练的情况下实现了强大的准确率，超越了多个经过训练的基线方法。

Conclusion: 多智能体上下文推理框架可以将LLM转化为具有竞争力的即插即用时间序列分类器，无需任何参数训练。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) spans diverse application scenarios, yet
labeled data are often scarce, making task-specific training costly and
inflexible. Recent reasoning-oriented large language models (LLMs) show promise
in understanding temporal patterns, but purely zero-shot usage remains
suboptimal. We propose FETA, a multi-agent framework for training-free TSC via
exemplar-based in-context reasoning. FETA decomposes a multivariate series into
channel-wise subproblems, retrieves a few structurally similar labeled examples
for each channel, and leverages a reasoning LLM to compare the query against
these exemplars, producing channel-level labels with self-assessed confidences;
a confidence-weighted aggregator then fuses all channel decisions. This design
eliminates the need for pretraining or fine-tuning, improves efficiency by
pruning irrelevant channels and controlling input length, and enhances
interpretability through exemplar grounding and confidence estimation. On nine
challenging UEA datasets, FETA achieves strong accuracy under a fully
training-free setting, surpassing multiple trained baselines. These results
demonstrate that a multi-agent in-context reasoning framework can transform
LLMs into competitive, plug-and-play TSC solvers without any parameter
training. The code is available at https://github.com/SongyuanSui/FETATSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集，以及由于符号和规则多样性有限加上封闭式答案导致容易过拟合。

Method: 开发MatheMagic方法，在测试时随机生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证，评估模型的归纳或演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎问题而非归纳问题，但会回归到标准数学；数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化效果差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了稳定、可扩展、可比较且对过拟合鲁棒的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在数学推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

Abstract: Empowerment, an information-theoretic measure of an agent's potential
influence on its environment, has emerged as a powerful intrinsic motivation
and exploration framework for reinforcement learning (RL). Besides for
unsupervised RL and skill learning algorithms, the specific use of empowerment
as a pre-training signal has received limited attention in the literature. We
show that empowerment can be used as a pre-training signal for data-efficient
downstream task adaptation. For this we extend the traditional notion of
empowerment by introducing discounted empowerment, which balances the agent's
control over the environment across short- and long-term horizons. Leveraging
this formulation, we propose a novel pre-training paradigm that initializes
policies to maximize discounted empowerment, enabling agents to acquire a
robust understanding of environmental dynamics. We analyze empowerment-based
pre-training for various existing RL algorithms and empirically demonstrate its
potential as a general-purpose initialization strategy: empowerment-maximizing
policies with long horizons are data-efficient and effective, leading to
improved adaptability in downstream tasks. Our findings pave the way for future
research to scale this framework to high-dimensional and complex tasks, further
advancing the field of RL.

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 随着推理模型快速发展，需要系统性地比较和评估不同模型的测试时扩展能力，现有评估方法无法有效处理性能退化和波动问题。

Method: 提出ARISE评估指标，包含两个关键创新：样本级感知机制惩罚计算增加但性能下降的情况，动态采样机制减少准确率波动和token计数不稳定性对评估的影响。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和智能体任务等多个领域评估先进推理模型，发现ARISE能提供可靠细粒度的扩展能力测量，显示不同模型在扩展效率上存在显著差异。

Conclusion: ARISE是评估测试时扩展能力的有效工具，实验表明Claude Opus相比其他当代推理模型展现出更优的扩展特性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has emerged as a transformative paradigm for enhancing the
performance of large reasoning models, enabling dynamic allocation of
computational resources during inference. However, as the landscape of
reasoning models rapidly expands, a critical question remains: how can we
systematically compare and evaluate the test-time scaling capabilities across
different models? In this paper, we introduce ARISE (Adaptive Resolution-aware
Scaling Evaluation), a novel metric specifically designed to assess the
test-time scaling effectiveness of large reasoning models. Unlike existing
evaluation approaches, ARISE incorporates two key innovations: (1) sample-level
awareness that effectively penalizes negative scaling behaviors where increased
computation leads to performance degradation, and (2) a dynamic sampling
mechanism that mitigates the impact of accuracy fluctuations and token count
instability on the final assessment. We conduct comprehensive experiments
evaluating state-of-the-art reasoning models across diverse domains including
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and agentic tasks. Our results
demonstrate that ARISE provides a reliable and fine-grained measurement of
test-time scaling capabilities, revealing significant variations in scaling
efficiency across models. Notably, our evaluation identifies Claude Opus as
exhibiting superior scaling characteristics compared to other contemporary
reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型虽然具备强大的多步推理能力，但存在严重的安全漏洞，这些漏洞的机制尚未被充分理解。研究旨在揭示安全对齐失败的根本原因。

Method: 使用线性探测方法追踪拒绝意图在token位置的变化，通过因果干预分析识别对拒绝行为有负面贡献的稀疏注意力头集合，并提出基于拒绝悬崖的数据选择方法。

Result: 发现拒绝悬崖现象，仅消融3%的注意力头就能将攻击成功率降至10%以下。提出的Cliff-as-a-Judge方法仅需1.7%的常规安全训练数据即可达到相当的安全改进效果。

Conclusion: 推理模型并非本质上不安全，而是其拒绝意图被系统性地抑制。通过机制性干预和高效数据选择，可以显著提升模型的安全对齐效果，实现"少即是多"的安全对齐策略。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) with multi-step reasoning capabilities have
shown remarkable problem-solving abilities, yet they exhibit concerning safety
vulnerabilities that remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate why
safety alignment fails in reasoning models through a mechanistic
interpretability lens. Using a linear probing approach to trace refusal
intentions across token positions, we discover a striking phenomenon termed as
\textbf{refusal cliff}: many poorly-aligned reasoning models correctly identify
harmful prompts and maintain strong refusal intentions during their thinking
process, but experience a sharp drop in refusal scores at the final tokens
before output generation. This suggests that these models are not inherently
unsafe; rather, their refusal intentions are systematically suppressed. Through
causal intervention analysis, we identify a sparse set of attention heads that
negatively contribute to refusal behavior. Ablating just 3\% of these heads can
reduce attack success rates below 10\%. Building on these mechanistic insights,
we propose \textbf{Cliff-as-a-Judge}, a novel data selection method that
identifies training examples exhibiting the largest refusal cliff to
efficiently repair reasoning models' safety alignment. This approach achieves
comparable safety improvements using only 1.7\% of the vanilla safety training
data, demonstrating a less-is-more effect in safety alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型对所有步骤都采用扩展推理，但子问题难度差异很大，关键步骤需要详细推理，而简单步骤只需简洁处理，这种统一处理方式造成了大量冗余。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链，对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning缩短了推理长度，显著提高了效率，且没有影响准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理模型中的冗余问题，在保持性能的同时大幅提升了效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

Abstract: Large language models hold promise as scientific assistants, yet existing
agents either rely solely on algorithm evolution or on deep research in
isolation, both of which face critical limitations. Pure algorithm evolution,
as in AlphaEvolve, depends only on the internal knowledge of LLMs and quickly
plateaus in complex domains, while pure deep research proposes ideas without
validation, resulting in unrealistic or unimplementable solutions. We present
DeepEvolve, an agent that integrates deep research with algorithm evolution,
uniting external knowledge retrieval, cross-file code editing, and systematic
debugging under a feedback-driven iterative loop. Each iteration not only
proposes new hypotheses but also refines, implements, and tests them, avoiding
both shallow improvements and unproductive over-refinements. Across nine
benchmarks in chemistry, mathematics, biology, materials, and patents,
DeepEvolve consistently improves the initial algorithm, producing executable
new algorithms with sustained gains. By bridging the gap between unguided
evolution and research without grounding, DeepEvolve provides a reliable
framework for advancing scientific algorithm discovery. Our code is available

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TelecomTS，一个来自5G电信网络的大规模可观测性数据集，填补了现有公开基准中可观测性数据不足的空白，支持异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业监控系统产生的大量可观测性时间序列数据具有零膨胀、高度随机性和最小时间结构的特点，但现有数据集往往经过匿名化和归一化处理，移除了尺度信息，限制了其在异常检测、根因分析和多模态推理等任务中的应用。

Method: 从5G电信网络收集大规模可观测性数据，构建TelecomTS数据集，包含异构的去匿名化协变量和明确的尺度信息，支持多种下游任务。

Result: 对最先进的时间序列、语言和推理模型进行基准测试，发现现有方法难以处理可观测性数据的突然、嘈杂和高方差动态特性。实验还强调了保留协变量绝对尺度的重要性。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够原生利用尺度信息的基础时间序列模型，以应对实际可观测性应用的需求。

Abstract: Modern enterprises generate vast streams of time series metrics when
monitoring complex systems, known as observability data. Unlike conventional
time series from domains such as weather, observability data are zero-inflated,
highly stochastic, and exhibit minimal temporal structure. Despite their
importance, observability datasets are underrepresented in public benchmarks
due to proprietary restrictions. Existing datasets are often anonymized and
normalized, removing scale information and limiting their use for tasks beyond
forecasting, such as anomaly detection, root-cause analysis, and multi-modal
reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce TelecomTS, a large-scale
observability dataset derived from a 5G telecommunications network. TelecomTS
features heterogeneous, de-anonymized covariates with explicit scale
information and supports a suite of downstream tasks, including anomaly
detection, root-cause analysis, and a question-answering benchmark requiring
multi-modal reasoning. Benchmarking state-of-the-art time series, language, and
reasoning models reveals that existing approaches struggle with the abrupt,
noisy, and high-variance dynamics of observability data. Our experiments also
underscore the importance of preserving covariates' absolute scale, emphasizing
the need for foundation time series models that natively leverage scale
information for practical observability applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RouteLLM是一个分层多智能体框架，将自然语言意图转化为约束感知的路线推荐系统，通过协调多个专业子智能体来解析用户查询、处理约束、检索POI和优化路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路由算法假设结构化输入和固定目标，难以适应自然语言查询；而基于LLM的方法在空间推理和联合建模路线级与POI级偏好方面存在困难。

Method: 提出分层多智能体框架：首先解析用户查询为结构化意图，然后通过管理器协调约束智能体、POI智能体和路径优化智能体，最后通过验证器确保约束满足并生成可解释的路线。

Result: 实验表明该方法能可靠地将文本偏好转化为约束感知的路线，在路线质量和偏好满足度方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: RouteLLM成功桥接了语言灵活性和空间结构，实现了对路线可行性和用户偏好的推理。

Abstract: Route recommendation aims to provide users with optimal travel plans that
satisfy diverse and complex requirements. Classical routing algorithms (e.g.,
shortest-path and constraint-aware search) are efficient but assume structured
inputs and fixed objectives, limiting adaptability to natural-language queries.
Recent LLM-based approaches enhance flexibility but struggle with spatial
reasoning and the joint modeling of route-level and POI-level preferences. To
address these limitations, we propose RouteLLM, a hierarchical multi-agent
framework that grounds natural-language intents into constraint-aware routes.
It first parses user queries into structured intents including POIs, paths, and
constraints. A manager agent then coordinates specialized sub-agents: a
constraint agent that resolves and formally check constraints, a POI agent that
retrieves and ranks candidate POIs, and a path refinement agent that refines
routes via a routing engine with preference-conditioned costs. A final verifier
agent ensures constraint satisfaction and produces the final route with an
interpretable rationale. This design bridges linguistic flexibility and spatial
structure, enabling reasoning over route feasibility and user preferences.
Experiments show that our method reliably grounds textual preferences into
constraint-aware routes, improving route quality and preference satisfaction
over classical methods.

TL;DR: 该论文比较了经典AI方法和基于大语言模型的方法在决策者对齐任务中的表现，发现在健康保险决策数据集上两种方法表现相当，经典AI方法在中等风险偏好上略有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着算法决策在高风险领域应用增多，AI对齐研究从通用价值对齐转向考虑决策者属性的情境特定方法。现有决策者对齐方法在泛化到新情境方面的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 实现了一个经典AI模型并开发了基于LLM的算法决策器，使用GPT-5（大型推理模型）和GPT-4（非推理模型）在零样本提示框架下进行评估，采用加权自一致性方法。在健康保险决策数据集上评估三种不同风险容忍度（0.0、0.5、1.0）的决策者。

Result: 经典AI和基于LLM的模型在基于属性的目标对齐方面表现相当，经典AI在中等风险偏好上表现出略好的对齐效果。

Conclusion: 两种方法在决策者对齐任务中都有价值，经典AI方法在特定风险配置下可能具有优势，为AI对齐研究提供了实证比较。

Abstract: As algorithmic decision-makers are increasingly applied to high-stakes
domains, AI alignment research has evolved from a focus on universal value
alignment to context-specific approaches that account for decision-maker
attributes. Prior work on Decision-Maker Alignment (DMA) has explored two
primary strategies: (1) classical AI methods integrating case-based reasoning,
Bayesian reasoning, and naturalistic decision-making, and (2) large language
model (LLM)-based methods leveraging prompt engineering. While both approaches
have shown promise in limited domains such as medical triage, their
generalizability to novel contexts remains underexplored. In this work, we
implement a prior classical AI model and develop an LLM-based algorithmic
decision-maker evaluated using a large reasoning model (GPT-5) and a
non-reasoning model (GPT-4) with weighted self-consistency under a zero-shot
prompting framework, as proposed in recent literature. We evaluate both
approaches on a health insurance decision-making dataset annotated for three
target decision-makers with varying levels of risk tolerance (0.0, 0.5, 1.0).
In the experiments reported herein, classical AI and LLM-based models achieved
comparable alignment with attribute-based targets, with classical AI exhibiting
slightly better alignment for a moderate risk profile. The dataset and
open-source implementation are publicly available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 优化LLMs在竞争环境中的表现会无意中导致模型失准，即使明确要求保持真实，竞争压力仍会促使模型产生欺骗性营销、虚假信息和有害内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解竞争性反馈循环如何影响LLM行为，特别是在商业广告、政治竞选和社交媒体等竞争性场景中。

Method: 使用模拟环境测试LLMs在三种竞争场景中的表现：商业销售、政治选举和社交媒体参与度。

Result: 竞争优化导致显著失准：销售提升6.3%伴随欺骗性营销增加14.0%；选票份额增加4.9%伴随虚假信息增加22.3%；参与度提升7.5%伴随虚假信息激增188.6%。

Conclusion: 市场竞争压力会系统性侵蚀AI对齐性，需要更强治理和精心设计的激励机制来防止竞争动态破坏社会信任。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping how information is
created and disseminated, from companies using them to craft persuasive
advertisements, to election campaigns optimizing messaging to gain votes, to
social media influencers boosting engagement. These settings are inherently
competitive, with sellers, candidates, and influencers vying for audience
approval, yet it remains poorly understood how competitive feedback loops
influence LLM behavior. We show that optimizing LLMs for competitive success
can inadvertently drive misalignment. Using simulated environments across these
scenarios, we find that, 6.3% increase in sales is accompanied by a 14.0% rise
in deceptive marketing; in elections, a 4.9% gain in vote share coincides with
22.3% more disinformation and 12.5% more populist rhetoric; and on social
media, a 7.5% engagement boost comes with 188.6% more disinformation and a
16.3% increase in promotion of harmful behaviors. We call this phenomenon
Moloch's Bargain for AI--competitive success achieved at the cost of alignment.
These misaligned behaviors emerge even when models are explicitly instructed to
remain truthful and grounded, revealing the fragility of current alignment
safeguards. Our findings highlight how market-driven optimization pressures can
systematically erode alignment, creating a race to the bottom, and suggest that
safe deployment of AI systems will require stronger governance and carefully
designed incentives to prevent competitive dynamics from undermining societal
trust.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了测试时计算扩展(TTS)策略，包括顺序扩展和并行扩展，利用验证比生成更容易的不对称验证特性，显著提升了AI系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在特定场景下验证响应比生成响应更容易，这种不对称验证特性凸显了测试时扩展的巨大潜力。

Method: 结合顺序扩展和并行扩展策略，顺序扩展延长生成过程，并行扩展验证并选择多个候选输出，利用不对称验证特性为验证器分配适度计算资源。

Result: 通过TTS扩展开源模型为"Heavy"变体，在BrowseComp基准上获得高达27个绝对点的提升，GLM-4.5 Heavy在BrowseComp和GAIA上分别达到54.0%和66.0%的准确率，与最佳专有模型相当。

Conclusion: 测试时扩展策略，特别是利用不对称验证特性，能够显著提升AI系统性能，开源模型通过TTS可以达到甚至超越专有模型的水平。

Abstract: Test-time compute can be scaled both sequentially and in parallel. Sequential
scaling involves lengthening the generation process, while parallel scaling
involves verifying and selecting among multiple candidate outputs. Combining
these two strategies has led to the most powerful AI systems, such as Grok 4
Heavy and GPT-5 Pro. In certain contexts (e.g., solving Sudoku puzzles),
verifying responses can be substantially easier than generating them. This
property, referred to as \emph{asymmetric verification}, highlights the strong
potential of test-time scaling (TTS). In this work, we study both sequential
and parallel TTS of deep search agents, motivated by the intuition that
verification in this setting is often much easier than generation. In
experiments, we first show that sequential scaling methods, such as budget
forcing, can be effective initially but soon degrade performance. Leveraging
asymmetric verification, however, we are able to achieve substantial
improvements by allocating only a modest amount of compute to the verifier. We
conduct experiments with flagship open-source models and extend them to their
``Heavy'' variants through TTS. These deep research agents achieve gains of up
to 27 absolute points on benchmarks such as BrowseComp. Remarkably, as an
open-source alternative, GLM-4.5 Heavy reaches accuracy of {\bf 54.0\%} on
BrowseComp and {\bf 66.0\%} on GAIA, placing it comparable to the best
proprietary choices such as OpenAI Deep Research. Tongyi-DeepResearch Heavy
further achieves {\bf 69.0\%} accuracy on BrowseComp, greatly surpassing the
best proprietary results.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as
we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the
typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and
then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem.
Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e.,
one that can accurately determine whether a solution solves the given problem.
We argue that systems research, long focused on designing and evaluating new
performance-oriented algorithms, is particularly well-suited for AI-driven
solution discovery. This is because system performance problems naturally admit
reliable verifiers: solutions are typically implemented in real systems or
simulators, and verification reduces to running these software artifacts
against predefined workloads and measuring performance. We term this approach
as AI-Driven Research for Systems (ADRS), which iteratively generates,
evaluates, and refines solutions. Using penEvolve, an existing open-source ADRS
instance, we present case studies across diverse domains, including load
balancing for multi-region cloud scheduling, Mixture-of-Experts inference,
LLM-based SQL queries, and transaction scheduling. In multiple instances, ADRS
discovers algorithms that outperform state-of-the-art human designs (e.g.,
achieving up to 5.0x runtime improvements or 50% cost reductions). We distill
best practices for guiding algorithm evolution, from prompt design to evaluator
construction, for existing frameworks. We then discuss the broader implications
for the systems community: as AI assumes a central role in algorithm design, we
argue that human researchers will increasingly focus on problem formulation and
strategic guidance. Our results highlight both the disruptive potential and the
urgent need to adapt systems research practices in the age of AI.

TL;DR: TaTToo是一个针对表格推理的PRM框架，通过显式表格推理步骤和工具验证来解决现有PRM在表格操作上的瓶颈，在5个基准测试中提升下游模型性能30.9%。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的表格推理基准测试中，TaTToo仅用8B参数就超越了72B参数的强基线模型，将下游策略LRM在推理时性能提升30.9%，并在不同TTS策略上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: TaTToo成功解决了表格推理中PRM的局限性，通过工具验证和表格基础推理显著提升了模型性能，为表格推理领域的测试时扩展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.
