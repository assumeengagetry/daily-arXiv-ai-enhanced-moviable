TL;DR: UniFit是一个基于多模态大语言模型的通用虚拟试穿框架，通过语义对齐模块和两阶段训练策略解决语义鸿沟和数据稀缺问题，支持多服装和模型间试穿等复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本指导的多任务虚拟试穿框架存在两个关键限制：(1)文本指令与参考图像之间的语义鸿沟；(2)复杂场景下的数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出UniFit框架，包含MLLM引导的语义对齐模块(MGSA)来捕获跨模态语义关系，并采用两阶段渐进训练策略和自合成流水线从有限数据中学习复杂任务。

Result: 实验表明UniFit不仅支持广泛的虚拟试穿任务，包括多服装和模型间试穿，而且达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: UniFit通过多模态大语言模型驱动，成功解决了虚拟试穿中的语义鸿沟和数据稀缺挑战，构建了一个通用的虚拟试穿框架。

Abstract: Image-based virtual try-on (VTON) aims to synthesize photorealistic images of a person wearing specified garments. Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/zwplus/UniFit.

### [2] [EfficientSAM3: Progressive Hierarchical Distillation for Video Concept Segmentation from SAM1, 2, and 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15833)
*Chengxi Zeng,Yuxuan Jiang,Aaron Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EfficientSAM3通过渐进式分层蒸馏方法，将SAM3的能力转移到轻量级模型上，实现设备端概念分割和跟踪，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3的统一架构（共享视觉骨干网络、DETR风格检测器、密集内存跟踪器）在设备端使用成本过高，需要开发高效的轻量级替代方案。

Method: 采用渐进式分层蒸馏（PHD）三阶段方法：编码器蒸馏、时序内存蒸馏和端到端微调，使用RepViT、TinyViT和EfficientViT等轻量级骨干网络。

Result: 在流行的VOS数据集上基准测试，与相关工作相比，实现了强大的性能-效率权衡。

Conclusion: EfficientSAM3系列模型能够在设备端实现概念分割和跟踪，同时保持与教师模型行为的高度一致性。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3) advances visual understanding with Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) across images and videos, but its unified architecture (shared vision backbone, DETR-style detector, dense-memory tracker) remains prohibitive for on-device use. We present EfficientSAM3, a family of efficient models built on Progressive Hierarchical Distillation (PHD) that transfers capability from SAM3 to lightweight students in three stages: (1) Encoder Distillation aligns image features via prompt-in-the-loop training on SA-1B; (2) Temporal Memory Distillation replaces dense memory with a compact Perceiver-based module trained on SA-V to compress and retrieve spatiotemporal features efficiently; and (3) End-to-End Fine-Tuning refines the full pipeline on the official SAM3 PCS data to preserve concept-level performance. PHD yields a spectrum of student variants using RepViT, TinyViT, and EfficientViT backbones, enabling on-device concept segmentation and tracking while maintaining high fidelity to teacher behavior. We benchmark on popular VOS datasets, and compare with varies of releated work, achieing strong performance-efficiency trade-offs.

### [3] [WALDO: Where Unseen Model-based 6D Pose Estimation Meets Occlusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15874)
*Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Yintao Ma,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出四种扩展方法改进基于模型的6D物体姿态估计，包括动态非均匀采样、多假设推理、迭代优化和遮挡增强训练，在遮挡场景下显著提升精度和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有6D姿态估计方法在遮挡场景下早期检测错误传播的问题，提升对未见物体的泛化能力。

Method: 动态非均匀密集采样策略、多假设推理机制、迭代优化和遮挡增强训练，以及新的加权可见性评估指标。

Result: 在ICBIN数据集上精度提升超过5%，BOP数据集上提升超过2%，推理速度提升约3倍。

Conclusion: 所提方法有效解决了遮挡场景下的姿态估计问题，显著提升了精度和效率，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is vital for robotics, augmented reality, and scene understanding. For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.

*Lukas Arzoumanidis,Julius Knechtel,Jan-Henrik Haunert,Youness Dehbi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于风格迁移的数据增强方法，通过将历史地图语料库的制图风格转移到矢量数据上，生成无限量的合成历史地图训练数据，解决了历史地图分析中标注数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图的自动化分析面临标注训练数据稀缺的挑战，特别是对于特定的同质制图领域。创建高质量训练数据耗时且需要大量人工努力，而现有合成数据往往缺乏真实性和多样性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：自动深度生成方法和手动随机退化技术，用于模拟历史地图扫描中常见的视觉不确定性和噪声。通过风格迁移生成合成历史地图训练数据。

Result: 使用生成的数据集在自构建图卷积网络上进行领域自适应语义分割，全面评估了数据引导方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决历史地图分析中训练数据稀缺的问题，为同质地图语料库的土地覆盖解释等任务提供了可行的数据增强方案。

Abstract: The automated analysis of historical documents, particularly maps, has drastically benefited from advances in deep learning and its success across various computer vision applications. However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans. To quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of our approach, the generated training datasets were employed for domain-adaptive semantic segmentation on a homogeneous map corpus using a Self-Constructing Graph Convolutional Network, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the impact of our data bootstrapping methods.

### [5] [Box6D : Zero-shot Category-level 6D Pose Estimation of Warehouse Boxes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15884)
*Yintao Ma,Sajjad Pakdamansavoji,Amir Rasouli,Tongtong Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Box6D是一种针对仓库场景中存储箱的类别级6D姿态估计方法，通过单次RGB-D观测，使用快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板而非实例特定模型进行姿态估计，显著降低推理时间约76%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决仓库自动化、拣货等场景中现有6D姿态估计方法的局限性：基于模型的方法需要精确CAD模型且泛化性差；无模型方法在复杂条件下容易失败；类别级方法过于通用且忽略环境和物体先验

Method: 使用单次RGB-D观测，通过快速二分搜索推断箱子尺寸，基于类别CAD模板进行姿态估计，采用深度合理性过滤器和早停策略拒绝不合理假设

Result: 在真实仓储场景和公共基准测试中，Box6D在保持竞争性或更优的6D姿态精度的同时，将推理时间减少了约76%

Conclusion: Box6D为仓库环境中的存储箱提供了一种高效准确的6D姿态估计解决方案，平衡了灵活性和精度，适用于工业应用

Abstract: Accurate and efficient 6D pose estimation of novel objects under clutter and occlusion is critical for robotic manipulation across warehouse automation, bin picking, logistics, and e-commerce fulfillment. There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.
  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.

### [6] [Clustered Error Correction with Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16112)
*Taeho Kang,Jaeyeon Park,Kyungjin Lee,Youngki Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进4D高斯泼溅的方法，通过椭圆误差聚类和分组4D高斯泼溅来解决动态场景重建中的像素对应模糊和动态区域密度不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯泼溅方法在重建动态场景时存在困难，无法准确解决模糊的像素对应关系，且在动态区域密度不足。

Method: 包含两个关键组件：(1) 椭圆误差聚类和误差校正泼溅添加，用于定位动态区域并初始化拟合泼溅；(2) 分组4D高斯泼溅，提高泼溅与动态对象映射的一致性。通过交叉视图颜色一致性指导，将渲染误差分类为缺失颜色和遮挡类型，并进行针对性校正。

Result: 在Neural 3D Video和Technicolor数据集上的评估表明，该方法显著提高了时间一致性，在Technicolor光场数据集上PSNR提高了0.39dB，达到了最先进的感知渲染质量。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了泼溅与动态对象的对齐，误差校正方法能够识别错误并正确初始化新泼溅。

Abstract: Existing 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) methods struggle to accurately reconstruct dynamic scenes, often failing to resolve ambiguous pixel correspondences and inadequate densification in dynamic regions. We address these issues by introducing a novel method composed of two key components: (1) Elliptical Error Clustering and Error Correcting Splat Addition that pinpoints dynamic areas to improve and initialize fitting splats, and (2) Grouped 4D Gaussian Splatting that improves consistency of mapping between splats and represented dynamic objects. Specifically, we classify rendering errors into missing-color and occlusion types, then apply targeted corrections via backprojection or foreground splitting guided by cross-view color consistency. Evaluations on Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves temporal consistency and achieves state-of-the-art perceptual rendering quality, improving 0.39dB of PSNR on the Technicolor Light Field dataset. Our visualization shows improved alignment between splats and dynamic objects, and the error correction method's capability to identify errors and properly initialize new splats. Our implementation details and source code are available at https://github.com/tho-kn/cem-4dgs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两阶段自改进范式，通过自生成详细文本推理来弥合视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类中的语义差距，无需新标注即可显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在领域特定视频分类任务中表现不佳，特别是在数据有限的情况下，存在语义推理差距问题

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段让VLM为每个视频生成详细文本推理，然后基于这些自生成推理进行微调；第二阶段进行传统的监督微调

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于直接监督微调

Conclusion: 自生成推理是适应视觉语言模型到领域特定视频分析的有效且标注高效的范式

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly integral to multimedia understanding; however, they often struggle with domain-specific video classification tasks, particularly in cases with limited data. This stems from a critical \textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.

### [8] [Layer-wise Noise Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction for Robust Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16162)
*Yuting Lu,Ziliang Wang,Weixin Xu,Wei Zhang,Yongqiang Zhao,Yang Yu,Xiaohong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LNG-SWR方法，通过层间噪声引导和选择性小波重构，在保持频谱一致性的同时实现频率自适应，提升医学图像分割的鲁棒性，可作为AT的插件增强或独立使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床部署需要分割模型在分布偏移和扰动下保持稳定。现有对抗训练方法存在清洁-鲁棒性权衡和高训练成本问题，限制了在医学影像中的可扩展性和可维护性。

Method: 训练时在多个层注入小噪声学习频率偏置先验，然后应用先验引导的选择性小波重构进行频率自适应：抑制噪声敏感频带、增强方向性结构和形状线索、稳定边界响应。

Result: 在CT和超声数据集上，LNG-SWR在清洁Dice/IoU上获得一致提升，显著减少强攻击下的性能下降；与AT结合产生叠加增益，在不牺牲清洁精度的情况下进一步改善鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LNG-SWR为医学图像分割提供了一条简单、有效且工程友好的鲁棒性路径，适用于对抗训练和标准训练两种机制。

Abstract: Clinical deployment requires segmentation models to stay stable under distribution shifts and perturbations. The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation. These results indicate that LNG-SWR provides a simple, effective, and engineering-friendly path to robust medical image segmentation in both adversarial and standard training regimes.

*Zihan Li,Yiqing Wang,Sina Farsiu,Paul Kinahan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MGLL是一个对比学习框架，通过多粒度语言学习提升医学图像的多标签和跨粒度对齐能力，解决了CLIP在复杂领域中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等现有方法主要关注单标签、单粒度的图像-文本对齐，但在医学成像等复杂领域中，图像通常对应多个高层标签和不同粒度的注释，需要更精细的多粒度对齐方法。

Method: 提出MGLL框架，利用结构化多标签监督，整合不同粒度的文本描述，引入带点约束的软标签监督来增强对齐，使用平滑KL散度确保跨粒度一致性，作为即插即用模块保持计算效率。

Result: 在构建的大规模多粒度数据集上预训练并在多个数据集上评估，MGLL在下游任务中优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: MGLL通过多粒度语言学习有效提升了医学图像理解中的多标签和跨粒度对齐性能，为复杂领域的视觉语言模型提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-text pretraining have significantly enhanced visual understanding by aligning visual and textual representations. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

### [10] [TetraSDF: Precise Mesh Extraction with Multi-resolution Tetrahedral Grid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16273)
*Seonghun Oh,Youngjung Uh,Jin-Hwa Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TetraSDF是一个精确的解析网格化框架，用于处理由ReLU MLP与多分辨率四面体位编码器组成的SDF表示，能够生成与学习等值面高度一致的高质量网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在提取与神经SDF零级集完全匹配的网格时面临挑战：基于采样的方法引入离散化误差，而连续分段仿射解析方法仅适用于普通ReLU MLP。

Method: 使用四面体位编码器的重心插值保持全局CPWA结构，在编码器诱导的多面体复形内跟踪ReLU线性区域，并采用源自编码器度量的固定解析输入预处理器减少方向偏差和稳定训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TetraSDF在SDF重建精度上匹配或超越现有基于网格的编码器，其解析提取器产生高度自一致的网格，忠实于学习等值面，同时保持实用的运行时和内存效率。

Conclusion: TetraSDF提供了一个精确的解析网格化解决方案，解决了神经SDF精确网格提取的挑战，在精度和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Extracting meshes that exactly match the zero-level set of neural signed distance functions (SDFs) remains challenging. Sampling-based methods introduce discretization error, while continuous piecewise affine (CPWA) analytic approaches apply only to plain ReLU MLPs. We present TetraSDF, a precise analytic meshing framework for SDFs represented by a ReLU MLP composed with a multi-resolution tetrahedral positional encoder. The encoder's barycentric interpolation preserves global CPWA structure, enabling us to track ReLU linear regions within an encoder-induced polyhedral complex. A fixed analytic input preconditioner derived from the encoder's metric further reduces directional bias and stabilizes training. Across multiple benchmarks, TetraSDF matches or surpasses existing grid-based encoders in SDF reconstruction accuracy, and its analytic extractor produces highly self-consistent meshes that remain faithful to the learned isosurfaces, all with practical runtime and memory efficiency.

*Milos Vukadinovic,Hirotaka Ieki,Yuki Sahasi,David Ouyang,Bryan He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种从3D心脏超声体积中自动选择标准2D视图的方法，通过深度学习视图分类器和解剖标志启发式算法重建标准超声心动图视图，验证显示96%准确率且能保持空间校准和诊断特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心脏超声依赖2D视频，而3D超声心动图能提供更好的图像质量，但医生习惯使用标准2D视图。需要一种方法既能利用3D扫描的速度和可用性，又能让医生以熟悉的2D格式解读数据。

Method: 应用深度学习视图分类器和基于解剖标志的下游启发式算法，结合心脏病专家提供的启发式方法，从3D心脏超声体积中重建标准超声心动图视图。

Result: 在来自2家医院的1,600个视频中，三位心脏病专家的盲法评估显示96%准确率。提取的2D视频能有效检测心脏异常并生成临床级心脏解剖测量。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从3D体积中提取保持空间校准和诊断特征的2D视频，使临床医生能够从3D体积中获得准确的真实世界解读。

Abstract: Although the heart has complex three-dimensional (3D) anatomy, conventional medical imaging with cardiac ultrasound relies on a series of 2D videos showing individual cardiac structures. 3D echocardiography is a developing modality that now offers adequate image quality for clinical use, with potential to streamline acquisition and improve assessment of off-axis features. We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes. We release the code and a dataset of 29 3D echocardiography videos https://github.com/echonet/3d-echo .

Abstract: Image-based 3D scene reconstruction, which transforms multi-view images into a structured 3D representation of the surrounding environment, is a common task across many modern applications. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a new paradigm to address this problem and offers considerable efficiency as compared to the previous methods. Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\times$ and 1.7$\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Click2Graph是首个交互式全景视频场景图生成框架，通过单一用户提示（如点击或边界框）实现跨时间分割跟踪、自主发现交互对象并预测三元组，形成时间一致的场景图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频场景图生成系统是封闭的前馈管道，无法融入人工指导；而可提示分割模型缺乏语义或关系推理能力。需要统一视觉提示与时空语义理解的交互框架。

Method: 引入动态交互发现模块生成主体条件对象提示，语义分类头执行联合实体和谓词推理，从单一用户提示实现分割跟踪、发现交互对象并预测三元组。

Result: 在OpenPVSG基准测试中，Click2Graph为人工引导的全景视频场景图生成建立了坚实基础，展示了如何结合人工提示与全景定位和关系推理。

Conclusion: Click2Graph通过统一视觉提示与时空语义理解，实现了可控且可解释的视频场景理解，将人工提示与全景定位和关系推理相结合。

Abstract: State-of-the-art Video Scene Graph Generation (VSGG) systems provide structured visual understanding but operate as closed, feed-forward pipelines with no ability to incorporate human guidance. In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.

Abstract: UV unwrapping flattens 3D surfaces to 2D with minimal distortion, often requiring the complex surface to be decomposed into multiple charts. Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Motivation: 现有方法在有限类别上微调CLIP进行分割会导致过拟合，并破坏预训练的视觉-语言对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了InfoCLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的有效性，展示了其适应性和优越性。

Conclusion: InfoCLIP能够稳定模态对齐，成功将CLIP的泛化能力迁移到分割任务中。

Abstract: Recently, the strong generalization ability of CLIP has facilitated open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, which labels pixels using arbitrary text. However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks validate the effectiveness of InfoCLIP in enhancing CLIP fine-tuning for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, demonstrating its adaptability and superiority in asymmetric transfer.

Abstract: Multi-task learning can suffer from destructive task interference, where jointly trained models underperform single-task baselines and limit generalization. To improve generalization performance in breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation via multi-task learning, we propose a novel consistency regularization approach that mitigates destructive interference between segmentation and classification. The consistency regularization approach is composed of differentiable BI-RADS-inspired morphological features. We validated this approach by training all models on the BrEaST dataset (Poland) and evaluating them on three external datasets: UDIAT (Spain), BUSI (Egypt), and BUS-UCLM (Spain). Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates statistically significant (p<0.001) improvements in generalization for segmentation task of the proposed multi-task approach vs. the baseline one: UDIAT, BUSI, BUS-UCLM (Dice coefficient=0.81 vs 0.59, 0.66 vs 0.56, 0.69 vs 0.49, resp.). The proposed approach also achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance under rigorous external validation on the UDIAT dataset.

Abstract: Achieving visual semantic understanding requires a unified framework that simultaneously handles object detection, category prediction, and attribute recognition. However, current advanced approaches rely on global similarity and struggle to capture fine-grained category distinctions and category-specific attribute diversity, especially in large-scale e-commerce scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a detection-guided generative framework that predicts hierarchical category and attribute tokens. For each detected object, we extract refined ROI-level features and employ a BART-based generator to produce semantic tokens in a coarse-to-fine sequence covering category hierarchies and property-value pairs, with support for property-conditioned attribute recognition. Experiments on both large-scale proprietary e-commerce datasets and open-source datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing similarity-based pipelines and multi-stage classification systems, achieving stronger fine-grained recognition and more coherent unified inference.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for medical image reasoning, yet fairness across demographic groups remains a major concern. Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning. These results highlight the potential of fairness-aware in-context learning as a scalable and data-efficient solution for equitable medical image reasoning.

Conclusion: 图表示方法能有效利用样本间关系，显著提升长尾分布数据集中的OOD检测性能

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is essential for safe deployment of deep neural networks (DNNs). This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods. Experiments over three benchmarks CIFAR10-LT, CIFAR100-LT, and ImageNet-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin in terms of FPR and tail-class ID classification accuracy.

Abstract: Deep neural networks used for human detection are highly vulnerable to adversarial manipulation, creating safety and privacy risks in real surveillance environments. Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability. Physical garments produced with sublimation printing achieve reliable suppression under indoor and outdoor recordings, confirming real-world feasibility.

Abstract: The demonstrated success of sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, exemplified by models such as DeepSeek and Grok, has motivated researchers to investigate their adaptation to diverse domains. In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation. Comprehensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Laser cutting is a widely adopted technology in material processing across various industries, but it generates a significant amount of dust, smoke, and aerosols during operation, posing a risk to both the environment and workers' health. Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643. The proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for material-aware laser cutting using speckle sensing.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an efficient, high-fidelity representation for real-time scene reconstruction and rendering. However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

Abstract: Recent advances in plant phenotyping have driven widespread adoption of multi sensor platforms for collecting crop canopy reflectance data. This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.

Abstract: Training a model for food recognition is challenging because the training samples, which are typically crawled from the Internet, are visually different from the pictures captured by users in the free-living environment. In addition to this domain-shift problem, the real-world food datasets tend to be long-tailed distributed and some dishes of different categories exhibit subtle variations that are difficult to distinguish visually. In this paper, we present a framework empowered with large language models (LLMs) to address these challenges in food recognition. We first leverage LLMs to parse food images to generate food titles and ingredients. Then, we project the generated texts and food images from different domains to a shared embedding space to maximize the pair similarities. Finally, we take the aligned features of both modalities for recognition. With this simple framework, we show that our proposed approach can outperform the existing approaches tailored for long-tailed data distribution, domain adaptation, and fine-grained classification, respectively, on two food datasets.

Conclusion: AMS-KV通过尺度自适应的KV缓存策略，有效解决了视觉自回归模型中下一尺度预测的内存瓶颈问题，显著提升了模型的可扩展性和计算效率。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive modeling (VAR) via next-scale prediction has emerged as a scalable image generation paradigm. While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%. Moreover, when the baseline VAR-d30 model encounters out-of-memory failures at a batch size of 128, AMS-KV enables stable scaling to a batch size of 256 with improved throughput.

Abstract: Synthesizing high-fidelity and controllable 4D LiDAR data is crucial for creating scalable simulation environments for autonomous driving. This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations. Project link: https://ocean-luna.github.io/LiSTAR.gitub.io.

Abstract: Traditional video reasoning segmentation methods rely on supervised fine-tuning, which limits generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios and lacks explicit reasoning. To address this, we propose \textbf{VideoSeg-R1}, the first framework to introduce reinforcement learning into video reasoning segmentation. It adopts a decoupled architecture that formulates the task as joint referring image segmentation and video mask propagation. It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem. A task difficulty-aware mechanism adaptively controls reasoning length for better efficiency and accuracy. Extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VideoSeg-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance in complex video reasoning and segmentation tasks.

Motivation: 解决HSI分类中大规模数据和计算密集型训练的问题，提高深度学习模型在实际遥感任务中的部署效率

Conclusion: 训练策略优化是HSI模型架构设计的有效补充，SpectralTrain为实际遥感应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification typically involves large-scale data and computationally intensive training, which limits the practical deployment of deep learning models in real-world remote sensing tasks. This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

Conclusion: Rad-GS证明了使用4D毫米波雷达进行鲁棒户外建图的可行性，为大规模场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Rad-GS, a 4D radar-camera SLAM system designed for kilometer-scale outdoor environments, utilizing 3D Gaussian as a differentiable spatial representation. Rad-GS combines the advantages of raw radar point cloud with Doppler information and geometrically enhanced point cloud to guide dynamic object masking in synchronized images, thereby alleviating rendering artifacts and improving localization accuracy. Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar. Real-world reconstruction at kilometer scale validates the potential of Rad-GS for large-scale scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 探索当视觉提示和目标图像来自不同视觉任务时，视觉语言模型是否仍能实现视觉上下文学习，突破跨任务VICL的边界。

Method: 设计文本提示生成和选择机制来隐式描述不同低层视觉任务间的差异，构建跨任务VICL数据集，并提出结合感知评分推理与传统评估指标的新型推理框架。

Result: 在九个跨任务场景中取得顶级结果，在十个额外场景中获得次优性能，成功解锁了视觉语言模型中跨任务VICL的潜力。

Conclusion: T2T-VICL框架证明了视觉语言模型在跨任务视觉上下文学习中的可行性，为统一视觉语言模型解决多样化下游任务开辟了新途径。

Abstract: In large language models (LLM), in-context learning (ICL) refers to performing new tasks by conditioning on small demonstrations provided in the input context. Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL. Our approach achieves top-tier results across nine cross-task scenarios and second-tier performance in ten additional scenarios, unlocking the boundaries of cross-task VICL within VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DCS-LDM提出了一种新的视觉生成范式，将信息复杂度与尺度解耦，通过构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，支持固定潜在表示下任意分辨率和帧率的解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型通常将尺度与内容复杂度耦合，使用更多潜在token来表示更高分辨率图像或更高帧率视频。但视觉数据所需的潜在容量主要取决于内容复杂度，尺度仅作为上限。

Method: 构建层次化、尺度无关的潜在空间，通过多级token建模样本复杂度，支持在固定潜在表示下解码到任意分辨率和帧率，实现灵活的计算-质量权衡。

Result: 实验结果显示DCS-LDM在提供跨多样尺度和视觉质量的灵活生成的同时，性能可与最先进方法相媲美。

Conclusion: DCS-LDM通过解耦信息复杂度与尺度，实现了更灵活的视觉生成范式，支持渐进式从粗到细的生成过程。

Abstract: Existing latent diffusion models typically couple scale with content complexity, using more latent tokens to represent higher-resolution images or higher-frame rate videos. However, the latent capacity required to represent visual data primarily depends on content complexity, with scale serving only as an upper bound. Motivated by this observation, we propose DCS-LDM, a novel paradigm for visual generation that decouples information complexity from scale. DCS-LDM constructs a hierarchical, scale-independent latent space that models sample complexity through multi-level tokens and supports decoding to arbitrary resolutions and frame rates within a fixed latent representation. This latent space enables DCS-LDM to achieve a flexible computation-quality tradeoff. Furthermore, by decomposing structural and detailed information across levels, DCS-LDM supports a progressive coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Experimental results show that DCS-LDM delivers performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering flexible generation across diverse scales and visual qualities.

*Chenyang Wu,Jiayi Fu,Chun-Le Guo,Shuhao Han,Chongyi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VTinker提出了一种新的视频帧插值方法，通过引导流上采样和纹理映射来解决高分辨率运动估计中的模糊、马赛克和重影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率视频帧插值面临像素运动大、计算成本高的问题。现有方法在低分辨率预测双向流后使用上采样，会导致流边缘模糊和马赛克，且无法捕捉精细像素运动，导致任务导向流错位，产生重影和不连续。

Method: VTinker包含两个核心组件：引导流上采样(GFU)和纹理映射。GFU使用输入帧作为引导来改善双线性上采样流的模糊细节；纹理映射生成中间代理帧，从中选择清晰纹理块映射到代理帧，通过重建模块生成最终插值帧。

Result: 大量实验表明VTinker在视频帧插值任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VTinker通过创新的引导流上采样和纹理映射机制，有效解决了高分辨率视频帧插值中的运动估计精度和视觉质量问题。

Abstract: Due to large pixel movement and high computational cost, estimating the motion of high-resolution frames is challenging. Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy. The proxy serves as a cue for selecting clear texture blocks from the input frames, which are then mapped onto the proxy to facilitate producing the final interpolated frame via a reconstruction module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VTinker achieves state-of-the-art performance in VFI. Codes are available at: https://github.com/Wucy0519/VTinker.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展使得真实图像与合成图像难以区分，现有AI生成图像检测方法在分布外泛化方面存在挑战，主要原因是训练过程中利用了伪捷径特征。

Method: 提出PiN-CLIP方法，联合训练噪声生成器和检测网络，通过交叉注意力融合视觉和类别语义特征构建正向激励噪声，在特征空间注入噪声来微调视觉编码器，抑制捷径敏感方向并放大稳定取证线索。

Result: 在包含42种不同生成模型合成的开放世界数据集上进行对比实验，该方法实现了新的最先进性能，平均准确率比现有方法提升5.4个百分点。

Conclusion: PiN-CLIP通过特征空间的正向激励噪声有效解决了AI图像检测中的泛化问题，能够提取更鲁棒和泛化的伪影表示。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made real and synthetic images increasingly indistinguishable. Although extensive efforts have been devoted to detecting AI-generated images, out-of-distribution generalization remains a persistent challenge. We trace this weakness to spurious shortcuts exploited during training and we also observe that small feature-space perturbations can mitigate shortcut dominance. To address this problem in a more controllable manner, we propose the Positive-Incentive Noise for CLIP (PiN-CLIP), which jointly trains a noise generator and a detection network under a variational positive-incentive principle. Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations. Comparative experiments are conducted on an open-world dataset comprising synthetic images generated by 42 distinct generative models. Our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with notable improvements of 5.4 in average accuracy over existing approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于压缩视频质量增强的预训练退化表示学习模块和分层终止机制，解决了现有方法无法处理未知QP和缺乏空间细节的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中QP可能部分或完全未知，现有非盲方法依赖已知QP，而当前盲方法只能捕获全局退化信息，缺乏空间细节，且所有QP使用相同架构忽略了不同压缩级别的计算需求差异。

Method: 使用预训练的退化表示学习模块解耦和提取高维多尺度退化表示来指导伪影去除，并引入分层终止机制根据压缩级别动态调整伪影减少阶段的数量。

Result: 在QP=22时，PSNR相比现有最佳盲方法提升了110%（从0.31dB到0.65dB），分层终止机制在QP=22时的平均推理时间比QP=42减少了一半。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了盲压缩视频质量增强的性能，同时通过动态调整计算复杂度提高了效率。

Abstract: Existing studies on Quality Enhancement for Compressed Video (QECV) predominantly rely on known Quantization Parameters (QPs), employing distinct enhancement models per QP setting, termed non-blind methods. However, in real-world scenarios involving transcoding or transmission, QPs may be partially or entirely unknown, limiting the applicability of such approaches and motivating the development of blind QECV techniques. Current blind methods generate degradation vectors via classification models with cross-entropy loss, using them as channel attention to guide artifact removal. However, these vectors capture only global degradation information and lack spatial details, hindering adaptation to varying artifact patterns at different spatial positions. To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.

Conclusion: SR3D框架通过解决训练与推理之间的差距，显著提升了室内点云3D目标检测的性能，同时保持了实时处理能力。

Abstract: Real-time 3D object detection from point clouds is essential for dynamic scene understanding in applications such as augmented reality, robotics and navigation. We introduce a novel Spatial-prioritized and Rank-aware 3D object detection (SR3D) framework for indoor point clouds, to bridge the gap between how detectors are trained and how they are evaluated. This gap stems from the lack of spatial reliability and ranking awareness during training, which conflicts with the ranking-based prediction selection used as inference. Such a training-inference gap hampers the model's ability to learn representations aligned with inference-time behavior. To address the limitation, SR3D consists of two components tailored to the spatial nature of point clouds during training: a novel spatial-prioritized optimal transport assignment that dynamically emphasizes well-located and spatially reliable samples, and a rank-aware adaptive self-distillation scheme that adaptively injects ranking perception via a self-distillation paradigm. Extensive experiments on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D show that SR3D effectively bridges the training-inference gap and significantly outperforms prior methods in accuracy while maintaining real-time speed.

Motivation: 高空间分辨率水体变化检测数据集稀缺，且现有深度学习方法未能充分利用深度特征中的空间语义和结构信息。

Method: 设计了SSCP注意力模块，包含多语义空间注意力(MSA)、结构关系感知全局注意力(SRGA)和通道自注意力(CSA)三个组件，可集成到现有WBCD模型中。

Result: 在提出的HSRW-CD和Water-CD数据集上的大量实验验证了SSCP的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: SSCP模块能够充分利用深度特征的空间语义和结构信息，显著提升水体变化检测的判别能力。

Abstract: Remote sensing Water Body Change Detection (WBCD) aims to detect water body surface changes from bi-temporal images of the same geographic area. Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP. The code of this work and the HSRW-CD dataset will be accessed at https://github.com/QingMa1/SSCP.

Conclusion: LEGO-SLAM成功实现了实时开放词汇语义SLAM，在保持性能的同时显著减少了内存和计算开销，为高级机器人交互提供了语义感知能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems to build photorealistic maps. However, these maps lack the open-vocabulary semantic understanding required for advanced robotic interaction. Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\% while maintaining rendering quality. Furthermore, we introduce a language-based loop detection approach that reuses these mapping features, eliminating the need for a separate detection model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGO-SLAM achieves competitive mapping quality and tracking accuracy, all while providing open-vocabulary capabilities at 15 FPS.

Method: 引入MIDA任务和数据集，评估12个最先进的MLLMs，分析失败模式，设计Social Chain-of-Thought推理管道和Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory模块

Result: 即使像GPT-4o这样的强大模型也难以可靠地区分真假，新框架在该挑战性任务上带来了性能提升

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs无法有效将语言与多模态社交线索相结合，缺乏建模他人知识、信念或意图的能力，需要新方法来构建更具感知力和可信度的AI系统

Abstract: Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module. Our framework yields performance improvement on this challenging task, demonstrating a promising new path toward building MLLMs capable of genuine human-like social reasoning.

Conclusion: 显式推理能有效增强嵌入质量，将生成推理过程融入嵌入提取是提升多模态表示的有效方法

Abstract: Multimodal embeddings are widely used in downstream tasks such as multimodal retrieval, enabling alignment of interleaved modalities in a shared representation space. While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training. Our method first enables the model to perform structured rationale generation conditioned on the instruction, and then extracts representations after reasoning has unfolded. This simple design enhances the context-conditional inference signals within the embedding, leading to improved multimodal representation quality. Experiments on the MMEB benchmark show that reasoning-guided conditioning improves multimodal retrieval performance by 4.9% over the non-reasoning baseline, confirming that explicit reasoning can effectively enhance embedding quality.

First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 现有基于网格的认知地图方法依赖离散化栅格表示，限制了模型在细粒度空间推理方面的能力，需要克服这一局限性以实现更精确的空间理解。

Method: 提出Video2Layout框架，使用连续对象边界坐标量化物体间物理距离和物体尺寸，包含监督微调和强化微调两个核心阶段，从AI2THOR模拟器构建高质量数据集。

Result: 在QVS-Bench和主流空间推理基准测试中，V2LO-7B模型相比基于网格地图训练的模型平均提升了4.92%的性能，验证了方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 连续边界坐标表示能够有效增强模型的空间计算能力，缓解自然语言描述空间关系时的固有模糊性，为多模态大语言模型的空间智能提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is a critical frontier for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), empowering them to comprehend the physical world. Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/ybrrraway/Video2Layout.

Conclusion: Simba框架通过分布学习方法有效解决了点云补全中的过拟合和噪声敏感性问题，实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is a fundamental task in 3D vision. A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling. Extensive experiments across the PCN, ShapeNet, and KITTI benchmarks validate our method's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Motivation: 处理长视频需要高效模型架构和有效处理扩展时间上下文的机制，同时发现视觉到文本信息聚合现象导致视觉token冗余。

Method: 采用混合Mamba-Transformer骨干网络，结合状态空间模型效率和注意力机制表达能力，提出TransV模块将视觉token转移压缩到指令token中。

Result: 在多个基准测试中与最先进模型竞争，同时扩展了处理帧数，能处理超过10,000帧的时长视频。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了开发、解释和压缩混合Mamba-Transformer架构的初步步骤，为混合模型可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We introduce TimeViper, a hybrid vision-language model designed to tackle challenges of long video understanding. Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers. We further analyze attention behaviors of both Mamba and Transformer layers, offering new insights into hybrid model interpretability. This work represents an initial step towards developing, interpreting, and compressing hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生存分析方法缺乏临床所需的透明度，且病理智能体在生存预测中存在三个局限：无法整合多模态数据、无效的感兴趣区域探索、未能利用历史案例的经验学习。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：(1)WSI-基因CoT增强案例库构建，通过分层分析处理病理图像和基因数据；(2)基于二分法的多专家智能体推理，通过RAG检索相似案例并整合多模态报告。

Result: 在五个TCGA队列上的广泛实验表明，SurvAgent优于传统方法、专有MLLM和医疗智能体。

Conclusion: SurvAgent为精准肿瘤学中的可解释AI驱动生存预测建立了新范式。

Abstract: Survival analysis is critical for cancer prognosis and treatment planning, yet existing methods lack the transparency essential for clinical adoption. While recent pathology agents have demonstrated explainability in diagnostic tasks, they face three limitations for survival prediction: inability to integrate multimodal data, ineffective region-of-interest exploration, and failure to leverage experiential learning from historical cases. We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction. SurvAgent consists of two stages: (1) WSI-Gene CoT-Enhanced Case Bank Construction employs hierarchical analysis through Low-Magnification Screening, Cross-Modal Similarity-Aware Patch Mining, and Confidence-Aware Patch Mining for pathology images, while Gene-Stratified analysis processes six functional gene categories. Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement. Extensive experiments on five TCGA cohorts demonstrate SurvAgent's superority over conventional methods, proprietary MLLMs, and medical agents, establishing a new paradigm for explainable AI-driven survival prediction in precision oncology.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态任务上的成功，其部署效率问题日益突出。现有方法仅延迟EOS token的出现来隐式延长输出，缺乏稳定性和可控性，无法直接最大化输出token长度作为明确优化目标。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1) 对抗性提示搜索，使用强化学习策略自动识别能诱导LLM组件产生冗余输出的对抗提示；2) 视觉对齐扰动优化，在输入图像上构建对抗样本，最大化扰动图像视觉嵌入与对抗提示嵌入之间的相似度。

Result: 在四种流行视觉语言模型上的综合实验表明，该方法在有效性、效率和泛化能力方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 提出的VTIA攻击方法能够有效诱导视觉语言模型产生冗余文本输出，为模型部署效率问题提供了新的研究视角。

Abstract: With the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on multimodal tasks, concerns regarding their deployment efficiency have become increasingly prominent. In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.

Conclusion: 这项工作为在视觉生成中交织文本推理提供了新的研究思路，有望激发更多相关研究。代码将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning. We hope this work inspires further research into interleaving textual reasoning for enhanced visual generation. Code will be released at: https://github.com/ZiyuGuo99/Thinking-while-Generating.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在长时程机器人操作中存在阶段幻觉问题，即智能体利用粗糙的评估信号来走捷径完成多步任务，报告高进度但并未真正完成任务。

Method: 1) 阶段对齐奖励(SAR)：使用三元组对比学习和Gemini生成的困难负样本来防止视觉捷径；2) 基于姿态的对象探索(POE)：基于相对对象-夹爪姿态而非原始像素来建立好奇心；3) 长时程记忆：使用选择性上下文保留和门控融合来稳定扩展执行过程中的内在塑造。

Result: 在Discoverse-L长时程操作基准测试中，EvoVLA将平均任务成功率提高了10.2个百分点，达到69.2%，样本效率提高1.5倍，阶段幻觉从38.5%降低到14.8%。真实世界部署在物理机器人上达到54.6%的平均成功率，比OpenVLA-OFT高出11个百分点。

Conclusion: EvoVLA通过其三个核心组件有效解决了VLA模型的阶段幻觉问题，实现了显著的性能提升和有效的模拟到真实世界的迁移，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation remains challenging for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models despite recent progress in zero-shot generalization and simulation-to-real-world transfer. Current VLA models suffer from stage hallucination, where agents exploit coarse evaluation signals to shortcut multi-step tasks, reporting high progress without truly completing them. We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

Result: 在八个基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保持高推理效率。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类注意力重聚焦机制，RF-CLIP有效提升了CLIP在开放词汇语义分割中的密集预测能力，证实了注意力机制优化对多模态对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) employs pixel-level vision-language alignment to associate category-related prompts with corresponding pixels. A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity. Our method achieves SOTA performance on eight benchmarks while maintaining high inference efficiency.

Method: 提出解耦视觉预测(DVF)，使用元查询和扩散Transformer头将视觉预测从主干网络分离，通过残差连接提供当前视觉状态，让元查询自动捕捉潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.7%的成功率，超越了强大基线模型，并表现出高收敛速度。实际评估中在指令跟随、泛化和推理能力方面优于π0.5模型。

Conclusion: Mantis通过解耦视觉预测有效减轻了VLA主干网络的负担，使其能够通过语言监督保持理解和推理能力，在机器人任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate that visual signals can effectively complement sparse action supervisions. However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $π_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability. Code and weights are released to support the open-source community.

Motivation: 现有VI-ReID算法在公共数据集上表现良好，但在真实场景中由于域差异而性能下降，需要解决无标注真实数据下的域自适应问题。

Conclusion: DSLGA方法有效解决了UDA-VI-ReID中的跨域和跨模态挑战，为真实场景应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (VI-ReID) has achieved remarkable performance on public datasets. However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models. A large amount of experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods for VI-ReID and even some supervised methods under various settings.

Abstract: Human organs are composed of interconnected substructures whose geometry and spatial relationships constrain one another. Yet, most deep-learning approaches treat these parts independently, producing anatomically implausible reconstructions. We introduce PrIntMesh, a template-based, topology-preserving framework that reconstructs organs as unified systems. Starting from a connected template, PrIntMesh jointly deforms all substructures to match patient-specific anatomy, while explicitly preserving internal boundaries and enforcing smooth, artifact-free surfaces. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the heart, hippocampus, and lungs, achieving high geometric accuracy, correct topology, and robust performance even with limited or noisy training data. Compared to voxel- and surface-based methods, PrIntMesh better reconstructs shared interfaces, maintains structural consistency, and provides a data-efficient solution suitable for clinical use.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have recently demonstrated remarkable progress in embodied environments, enabling robots to perceive, reason, and act through unified multimodal understanding. Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions. Existing studies mainly focus on single-modality perturbations and overlook the cross-modal misalignment that fundamentally affects embodied reasoning and decision-making. In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework. Experiments on the LIBERO benchmark using a fine-tuned OpenVLA model reveal that even minor multimodal perturbations can cause significant behavioral deviations, demonstrating the fragility of embodied multimodal alignment.

Abstract: Unsupervised image classification, or image clustering, aims to group unlabeled images into semantically meaningful categories. Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, "Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods. To the best of our knowledge, ICCE is the first fully unsupervised image classification method to exceed 70% accuracy on ImageNet.

Conclusion: SwiTrack通过状态切换框架有效解决了跨模态目标跟踪中的目标漂移问题，提供了更鲁棒的跨模态表示和可靠的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal object tracking (CMOT) is an emerging task that maintains target consistency while the video stream switches between different modalities, with only one modality available in each frame, mostly focusing on RGB-Near Infrared (RGB-NIR) tracking. Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\% and 4.3\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Abstract: Realistic and smooth full-body tracking is crucial for immersive AR/VR applications. Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.

To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The task of weed detection is an essential element of precision agriculture since accurate species identification allows a farmer to selectively apply herbicides and fits into sustainable agriculture crop management. This paper proposes a hybrid deep learning framework recipe for weed detection that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViTs), and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to build robustness to multiple field conditions. A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data. Experimental results yield superior results with 99.33% accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on multi-benchmark datasets. The proposed model architecture enables local, global, and relational feature representations and offers high interpretability and adaptability. Practically, the framework allows real-time, efficient deployment of edge devices for automated weed detecting, reducing over-reliance on herbicides and providing scalable, sustainable precision-farming options.

Motivation: 尽管视觉基础模型在多样化下游任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，但其表示通常被下采样14x/16x（如ViT），限制了在像素级应用中的直接使用。现有特征上采样方法依赖于数据集特定的重新训练或繁重的隐式优化，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Upsample Anything提供了一种高效、通用的特征上采样解决方案，无需训练即可实现精确的高分辨率重建，具有出色的跨架构和跨模态迁移能力。

Abstract: We present \textbf{Upsample Anything}, a lightweight test-time optimization (TTO) framework that restores low-resolution features to high-resolution, pixel-wise outputs without any training. Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\approx0.419 \text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.

Conclusion: 稀疏自编码器可作为跨模态大规模主题分析的有效工具，为嵌入分析提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to analyze embeddings, but their role and practical value are debated. We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints. Our work positions SAEs as effective tools for large-scale thematic analysis across modalities. Code and data will be released upon publication.

Abstract: We present NaTex, a native texture generation framework that predicts texture color directly in 3D space. In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment. Moreover, NaTex also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, either training-free or with simple tuning, for various downstream applications, e.g., material generation, texture refinement, and part segmentation and texturing.

Abstract: Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) aims to restore visibility and correct color distortions caused by wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering. Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms. Ablation studies and visualizations further validate the contribution of each component. The source code is available at https://github.com/chingheng0808/WWE-UIE.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) aims to identify surface changes from co-registered bi-temporal images. However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses. Finally, a learnable morphology module refines the upsampled logits to recover clean boundaries. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that ChangeDINO consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in IoU and F1, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component.

Abstract: Face super-resolution (FSR) is a critical technique for enhancing low-resolution facial images and has significant implications for face-related tasks. However, existing FSR methods are limited by fixed up-sampling scales and sensitivity to input size variations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an Arbitrary-Resolution and Arbitrary-Scale FSR method with implicit representation networks (ARASFSR), featuring three novel designs. First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of ARASFSR over existing state-of-the-art methods while super-resolving facial images across various input sizes and up-sampling scales.

Abstract: The study of terrain and landform classification through UAV remote sensing diverges significantly from ground vehicle patrol tasks. Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for robotics and Extended Reality (XR), enabling reliable navigation and alignment of virtual and real content. Existing visual methods often suffer from drift, scale ambiguity, and depend on fiducials or loop closure. This work introduces a real-time method for localizing a camera within a pre-captured, highly accurate colored LiDAR point cloud. By rendering synthetic views from this cloud, 2D-3D correspondences are established between live frames and the point cloud. A neural rendering technique narrows the domain gap between synthetic and real images, reducing occlusion and background artifacts to improve feature matching. The result is drift-free camera tracking with correct metric scale in the global LiDAR coordinate system. Two real-time variants are presented: Online Render and Match, and Prebuild and Localize. We demonstrate improved results on the ScanNet++ dataset and outperform existing SLAM pipelines.

Conclusion: MOMNet能够有效处理不对齐的RGB-D数据，为现实场景深度重建提供可靠解决方案

Abstract: Recent guided depth super-resolution methods are premised on the assumption of strictly spatial alignment between depth and RGB, achieving high-quality depth reconstruction. However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth.

Abstract: Offline signature verification (OSV) is a frequently utilized technology in forensics. This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins. The emphasis on local structure matching not only improves performance but also enhances the model's interpretability, supporting our findings. Additionally, our model demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities in cross-dataset testing scenarios. The combination of generalizability and interpretability significantly bolsters the potential of DetailSemNet for real-world applications.

TL;DR: CAMS提出了一种基于CLIP的组成式零样本学习方法，通过门控交叉注意力机制和多空间解缠技术，从视觉特征中提取语义特征并在多维空间中进行语义解缠，从而提升对未见属性-对象组合的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的CZSL方法主要依赖图像编码器获得的全局语义表示，但这种表示能力有限，无法完全解缠属性和对象。需要更精细的语义特征提取和更好的解缠机制。

Method: 设计了门控交叉注意力机制，从CLIP的高层图像编码块中通过一组潜在单元捕获细粒度语义特征，同时自适应抑制背景和其他无关信息。随后进行多空间解缠，实现属性和对象语义的解缠。

Result: 在三个流行基准测试（MIT-States、UT-Zappos和C-GQA）上的实验表明，CAMS在封闭世界和开放世界设置下都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMS通过精细的语义特征提取和多空间解缠技术，有效提升了组成式零样本学习的性能，特别是在未见属性-对象组合的识别方面表现出色。

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to learn the concepts of attributes and objects in seen compositions and to recognize their unseen compositions. Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Motivation: 传统基于标记的光学运动捕捉系统依赖密集标记配置，存在准备耗时、标记识别模糊等问题，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 引入刚性体标记(RBM)作为基本单元，提供明确的6自由度数据；开发基于深度学习的回归模型，在测地线损失下直接估计SMPL参数。

Result: 端到端方法在性能上匹配基于优化的方法，同时计算量减少一个数量级以上；在AMASS数据集上达到最先进的姿态估计精度；实际Vicon系统验证了方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 稀疏6自由度RBM与流形感知测地线损失相结合，为图形学、虚拟现实和生物力学中的实时运动捕捉提供了实用且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Marker-based optical motion capture (MoCap), while long regarded as the gold standard for accuracy, faces practical challenges, such as time-consuming preparation and marker identification ambiguity, due to its reliance on dense marker configurations, which fundamentally limit its scalability. To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach. Overall, the results show that combining sparse 6-DoF RBM with a manifold-aware geodesic loss yields a practical and high-fidelity solution for real-time MoCap in graphics, virtual reality, and biomechanics.

Motivation: 现有的自监督环视深度估计方法在多相机重叠区域存在深度估计不一致的问题，需要解决跨视图深度一致性的挑战。

Method: 基于相机内外参，首先为每张图像预测初始深度图，然后将所有图像的3D点投影到共享单位圆柱面建立邻域关系，生成位置图，最后应用基于圆柱面距离的非学习空间注意力机制聚合跨图像特征来预测最终深度图。

Conclusion: 提出的几何引导方法能够有效解决多相机深度估计中的跨视图一致性问题，为环视3D感知提供了密集、度量和跨视图一致的深度估计。

Abstract: Self-supervised surround-view depth estimation enables dense, low-cost 3D perception with a 360° field of view from multiple minimally overlapping images. Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder. Based on these position maps, we apply an explicit, non-learned spatial attention that aggregates features among pixels across images according to their distances on the cylinder, to predict a final depth map per image. Evaluated on the DDAD and nuScenes datasets, our approach improves the consistency of depth estimates across images and the overall depth compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate identification of hepatocystic anatomy is critical to preventing surgical complications during laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.
  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.
  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.
  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.

Motivation: 现有小样本分割方法主要从支持图像中提取元指导信息，但由于视觉表示的类内差异，这些信息无法为未训练类别提供准确指导。作者认为支持图像提供的参考信息可能不是必需的，关键在于为训练和未训练类别提供无偏的元指导。

Method: 设计了语言驱动的属性泛化架构(LDAG)，包含多属性增强模块(MaE)和多模态属性对齐模块(MaA)。MaE通过大语言模型生成目标类的多个详细属性描述，构建精炼的视觉-文本先验指导；MaA实现属性文本与视觉特征的跨模态交互。

Result: 实验表明，所提方法明显优于现有方法，实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 利用目标属性语言描述构建鲁棒支持策略的方法在小样本分割任务中具有显著优势，代码将发布。

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment novel classes under the guidance of limited support samples by a meta-learning paradigm. Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching. Meanwhile, due to text-vision modal shift, attribute text struggles to promote visual feature representation, we design a Multi-modal Attribute Alignment (MaA) to achieve cross-modal interaction between attribute texts and visual feature. Experiments show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a clear margin and achieves the new state-of-the art performance. The code will be released.

Motivation: 现有垃圾检测数据集缺乏对垃圾容器溢出监控的关注，特别是在垃圾车拍摄图像中的动态环境应用有限，需要更实用的数据集来支持真实世界的物流管理。

Method: 创建包含垃圾和垃圾容器的城市场景数据集，提供三个任务的基准测试，并提出两种改进策略：基于启发式的垃圾容器跟踪方法和利用几何先验的模型无关分割框架。

Result: 微调的目标检测器在垃圾容器检测上表现良好，但基线跟踪方法在数量估计上困难；提出的启发式方法将平均绝对计数误差降低79.6%；几何感知策略在轻量模型上将分割mAP@0.5提高27%。

Conclusion: StreetView-Waste为城市垃圾管理的真实世界感知系统研究提供了具有挑战性的基准，展示了多模态输入在此任务中的价值。

Abstract: Urban waste management remains a critical challenge for the development of smart cities. Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLA-Pruner是一种专门针对Vision-Language-Action模型的token剪枝方法，通过双级重要性标准（语义级和动作级）来保留关键视觉token，在保证性能的同时实现高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLM token剪枝方法仅基于语义显著性选择token，忽视了VLA模型的双系统特性（高级语义理解和低级动作执行），导致动作生成所需的关键信息被丢弃，显著降低VLA性能。

Method: 提出VLA-Pruner方法，采用双级重要性标准：视觉-语言预填充注意力用于语义级相关性，通过时间平滑估计的动作解码注意力用于动作级重要性。基于此标准设计自适应双级token选择策略。

Result: 实验表明VLA-Pruner在多种VLA架构和多样化机器人任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VLA-Pruner是一种通用即插即用的VLA专用token剪枝方法，能够有效平衡语义理解和动作执行的需求，在计算预算下保持紧凑且信息丰富的视觉token集。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown great promise for embodied AI, yet the heavy computational cost of processing continuous visual streams severely limits their real-time deployment. Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget. Experiments show that VLA-Pruner achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple VLA architectures and diverse robotic tasks.

Conclusion: LLaVA³证明了仅使用多视角2D图像就能有效提升VLM的3D场景理解能力，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Developing a multi-modal language model capable of understanding 3D scenes remains challenging due to the limited availability of 3D training data, in contrast to the abundance of 2D datasets used for vision-language models (VLM). As an alternative, we introduce LLaVA$^3$ (pronounced LLaVA-Cube), a novel method that improves the 3D scene understanding capabilities of VLM using only multi-view 2D images and without any fine-tuning. Inspired by Cubist painters, who represented multiple viewpoints of a 3D object within a single picture, we propose to describe the 3D scene for the VLM through omnidirectional visual representations of each object. These representations are derived from an intermediate multi-view 3D reconstruction of the scene. Extensive experiments on 3D VQA and 3D language grounding show that our approach outperforms previous 2D-based VLM solutions.

Abstract: The corpus callosum, the largest commissural structure in the human brain, is a central focus in research on aging and neurological diseases. It is also a critical target for interventions such as deep brain stimulation and serves as an important biomarker in clinical trials, including those investigating remyelination therapies. Despite extensive research on corpus callosum segmentation, few publicly available tools provide a comprehensive and automated analysis pipeline. To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis. We demonstrate that FastSurfer-CC outperforms existing specialized tools across the individual tasks. Moreover, our method reveals statistically significant differences between Huntington's disease patients and healthy controls that are not detected by the current state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 视频预测是机器人和世界建模等下游应用的基础任务，但现有模型在遮挡场景下表现不佳。作者假设提供明确的运动信息（通过点流）和几何结构信息（通过深度图）能够改善遮挡情况下的预测效果。

Method: 使用标准的多对象潜在变换器架构进行未来帧预测，但修改该架构以融入深度和点流信息。在合成和真实世界数据集上进行受控评估，不仅使用基于外观的指标，还使用对象掩码上的Wasserstein距离来有效测量预测的运动分布。

Conclusion: 通过引入点流和深度信息，视频预测模型在遮挡场景和背景运动预测方面取得了显著改进，这为处理复杂视觉场景的视频预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video prediction is a fundamental task for various downstream applications, including robotics and world modeling. Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction. We find that when the prediction model is assisted with point flow and depth, it performs better in occluded scenarios and predicts more accurate background motion compared to models without the help of these modalities.

Conclusion: 该框架能够泛化到未见过的姿势，无需额外训练数据即可实现数据增强和对新型微机器人配置的鲁棒姿态估计。

Abstract: Precise pose estimation of optical microrobots is essential for enabling high-precision object tracking and autonomous biological studies. However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.

Motivation: DCE-MRI在乳腺癌筛查和治疗中很重要，但不同采集协议和个体因素导致组织外观差异大，使得自动肿瘤分割具有挑战性。

Method: 使用特征线性调制层（FiLM）将采集时间信息整合到模型中，根据特定采集序列调节模型特征，支持可变数量的图像输入。

Result: 在领域内和领域外数据集上的评估表明，整合相位采集时间知识提高了肿瘤分割性能和模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用图像采集时间信息可以有效改善乳腺DCE-MRI肿瘤分割的准确性和泛化性。

Abstract: Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) plays an important role in breast cancer screening, tumor assessment, and treatment planning and monitoring. The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset. Evaluation on in-domain images and a public out-of-domain dataset showed that incorporating knowledge of phase acquisition time improved tumor segmentation performance and model generalization.

Conclusion: 提出的方法为室内场景建图和CMC注册提供了有效的联合解决方案，建立了首个协作场景建图和CMC注册的基准数据集。

Abstract: Using ceiling-mounted cameras (CMCs) for indoor visual capturing opens up a wide range of applications. However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance. We thus provide a reliable tool to facilitate downstream position-aware applications.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of combat sports using computer vision has gained traction in recent years, yet the development of robust datasets remains a major bottleneck due to the dynamic, unstructured nature of actions and variations in recording environments. In this work, we present a comprehensive, well-annotated video dataset tailored for punch detection and classification in boxing.

TL;DR: 本文提出SemCLIP方法，通过结合释义和否定来改进CLIP模型，在保持原有性能的同时显著提高对否定文本的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在处理否定和释义文本时表现不一致，因为否定会以最小词汇变化彻底改变含义，而释义则可能用不同表达表示相同含义，这对视觉语言模型的对齐提出了挑战。

Method: 提出SemCLIP方法：评估释义和否定的组合，设计新的对比损失函数，使用LLM生成的包含原始、释义和否定文本描述的三元组来训练CLIP类模型。

Result: 在CC-Neg基准测试中，将图像检索准确率从68.1%提升至78.1%；在Sugarcrepe++基准测试中表现优于仅使用否定文本训练的模型；在零样本分类任务中优于CLIP。

Conclusion: SemCLIP能够显著提高对语义变换的鲁棒性，在保持CLIP性能的同时有效处理否定和释义文本。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models continue to be the dominant approach for image and text retrieval. Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的多摄像机体操运动员跟踪方法，通过结合体操领域知识（运动员3D中心位于预设垂直平面）和级联数据关联范式，在交叉视角检测不足时使用射线-平面相交生成共面3D轨迹候选，提高了跟踪鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体操运动员跟踪面临独特挑战：摄像机数量有限，以及光照、背景、服装变化和遮挡导致多摄像机检测可能在某些视角失败，仅能从两个相对视角提供有效检测，这使得传统多摄像机三角测量难以准确确定运动员3D轨迹。

Result: 通过广泛实验验证了方法的鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中优于现有方法。该跟踪方法已成功应用于最近的体操世锦赛，获得国际体操联合会的高度认可。

Conclusion: 结合体操领域知识的级联数据关联方法有效解决了多摄像机体操运动员跟踪的挑战，共面候选轨迹补偿了不确定轨迹，最小化了跟踪失败，在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: We present a robust multi-camera gymnast tracking, which has been applied at international gymnastics championships for gymnastics judging. Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.

Conclusion: 该框架为构建稳健、可扩展的取证归因系统提供了重要进展，能够适应不断演变的生成AI环境，无需大量重新训练。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly indistinguishable from authentic content, posing significant challenges for digital media integrity. This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.
  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.
  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches . For the source attribution task, the proposed approach obtains improvements of of 14.70\% and 4.27\% in AUC and OSCR respectively on an open set classification context, marking a significant advancement toward robust, scalable forensic attribution systems capable of adapting to the evolving generative AI landscape without requiring exhaustive retraining protocols.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting has been introduced as a compelling alternative to NeRF for Earth observation, offering com- petitive reconstruction quality with significantly reduced training times. In this work, we extend the Earth Observation Gaussian Splatting (EOGS) framework to propose EOGS++, a novel method tailored for satellite imagery that directly operates on raw high-resolution panchromatic data without requiring external preprocessing. Furthermore, leveraging optical flow techniques we embed bundle adjustment directly within the training process, avoiding reliance on external optimization tools while improving camera pose estimation. We also introduce several improvements to the original implementation, including early stopping and TSDF post-processing, all contributing to sharper reconstructions and better geometric accuracy. Experiments on the IARPA 2016 and DFC2019 datasets demonstrate that EOGS++ achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of reconstruction quality and effi- ciency, outperforming the original EOGS method and other NeRF-based methods while maintaining the computational advantages of Gaussian Splatting. Our model demonstrates an improvement from 1.33 to 1.19 mean MAE errors on buildings compared to the original EOGS models

TL;DR: VARiant通过在VAR模型中采用等距采样选择不同深度的子网络，早期尺度使用全网络处理，后期尺度使用子网络，实现单模型内灵活深度调整，显著降低内存消耗和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAR模型多尺度生成中累积KV缓存导致的高内存开销问题，以及观察到的尺度-深度不对称依赖现象。

Method: 采用等距采样选择多个子网络（16到2层），早期尺度用全网络处理，后期尺度用子网络处理，子网络与全网络共享权重，并提出渐进式训练策略解决优化冲突。

Result: 在ImageNet上，VARiant-d16和VARiant-d8几乎达到与VAR-d30相当的质量（FID 2.05/2.12 vs 1.95），同时减少40-65%内存消耗；VARiant-d2实现3.5倍加速和80%内存减少。

Conclusion: VARiant的单模型架构支持零成本运行时深度切换，提供从高质量到极致效率的灵活部署选项，适应多样化应用场景。

Abstract: Visual Auto-Regressive (VAR) models significantly reduce inference steps through the "next-scale" prediction paradigm. However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.
  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.
  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.
  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%. VARiant-d2 achieves 3.5 times speedup and 80% memory reduction at moderate quality cost (FID 2.97). In terms of deployment, VARiant's single-model architecture supports zero-cost runtime depth switching and provides flexible deployment options from high quality to extreme efficiency, catering to diverse application scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in stereo matching have focused on accuracy, often at the cost of significantly increased model size. Traditionally, the community has regarded efficient models as incapable of zero-shot ability due to their limited capacity. In this paper, we introduce Lite Any Stereo, a stereo depth estimation framework that achieves strong zero-shot generalization while remaining highly efficient. To this end, we design a compact yet expressive backbone to ensure scalability, along with a carefully crafted hybrid cost aggregation module.

Together, these components demonstrate that an ultra-light model can deliver strong generalization, ranking 1st across four widely used real-world benchmarks. Remarkably, our model attains accuracy comparable to or exceeding state-of-the-art non-prior-based accurate methods while requiring less than 1% computational cost, setting a new standard for efficient stereo matching.

Abstract: The early detection of wildfires is a critical environmental challenge, with timely identification of smoke plumes being key to mitigating large-scale damage. While deep neural networks have proven highly effective for localization tasks, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for smoke detection limits their potential. In response, we leverage generative AI techniques to address this data limitation by synthesizing a comprehensive, annotated smoke dataset. We then explore unsupervised domain adaptation methods for smoke plume segmentation, analyzing their effectiveness in closing the gap between synthetic and real-world data. To further refine performance, we integrate advanced generative approaches such as style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and image matting. These methods aim to enhance the realism of synthetic data and bridge the domain disparity, paving the way for more accurate and scalable wildfire detection models.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce POMA-3D, the first self-supervised 3D representation model learned from point maps. Point maps encode explicit 3D coordinates on a structured 2D grid, preserving global 3D geometry while remaining compatible with the input format of 2D foundation models. To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates). Overall, our POMA-3D explores a point map way to 3D scene understanding, addressing the scarcity of pretrained priors and limited data in 3D representation learning.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效推进了长尾目标检测的发展，通过处理类别不平衡和改善特征表示，显著提升了稀有类别的检测性能。

Abstract: Object detection has been widely explored for class-balanced datasets such as COCO. However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.
  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers. To address this issue, we explore metric learning to produce feature embeddings that are both well-separated across classes and tightly clustered within each class. For inference, we utilize a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) approach to improve classification performance, particularly for rare classes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in advancing long-tailed object detection.

Motivation: 医学分割网络需要选择性遗忘能力以满足隐私合规、伦理部署和数据集持续修订的需求，避免完全重新训练的高成本。

Method: 采用教师-学生蒸馏范式，结合LoRA约束子空间更新，通过强遗忘阶段对抗性优化LoRA模块来移除指定知识，随后通过温和恢复阶段恢复保留数据的泛化能力。

Result: 在ISIC分割中，遗忘集IoU从0.875降至0.509，保留集和验证集性能保持竞争力；在CHASE数据集上同样有效；ISIC分类中遗忘集准确率从87.0%降至64.1%，保留集准确率从83.9%提升至90.6%。

Conclusion: 基于LoRA的子空间遗忘为医学图像分析提供了负责任、可控且可逆的遗忘途径，使模型能够忘记敏感样本或结构，同时保留关键性能。

Abstract: The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.
  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.
  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.

Abstract: We present SAM 3D, a generative model for visually grounded 3D object reconstruction, predicting geometry, texture, and layout from a single image. SAM 3D excels in natural images, where occlusion and scene clutter are common and visual recognition cues from context play a larger role. We achieve this with a human- and model-in-the-loop pipeline for annotating object shape, texture, and pose, providing visually grounded 3D reconstruction data at unprecedented scale. We learn from this data in a modern, multi-stage training framework that combines synthetic pretraining with real-world alignment, breaking the 3D "data barrier". We obtain significant gains over recent work, with at least a 5:1 win rate in human preference tests on real-world objects and scenes. We will release our code and model weights, an online demo, and a new challenging benchmark for in-the-wild 3D object reconstruction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的教师引导剪枝框架，将知识蒸馏与重要性评分估计紧密结合，实现一次性全局剪枝，避免了传统剪枝方法需要多次训练-剪枝-再训练循环的高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非结构化剪枝需要多次迭代训练-剪枝-再训练循环导致的高计算开销问题，寻求一种更高效的剪枝方法。

Method: 在重要性评分计算中利用教师模型的梯度信号，识别并保留对任务性能和知识转移都至关重要的参数，采用一次性全局剪枝策略，剪枝后使用稀疏感知的再训练来恢复精度。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet等多个图像分类基准测试中，该方法在高稀疏度下实现了最小性能损失，在高稀疏度下优于EPG和EPSD等最先进基线方法，同时比COLT等迭代剪枝方案计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个计算效率高、性能保持好的解决方案，特别适合在资源受限环境中部署。

Abstract: Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT. The proposed framework offers a computation-efficient, performance-preserving solution well suited for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is crucial for computer-assisted surgery, enabling precise localization and tracking of instruments and tissues. Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization. Building on SA-SV, we propose SAM2S, a foundation model enhancing \textbf{SAM2} for \textbf{S}urgical iVOS through: (1) DiveMem, a trainable diverse memory mechanism for robust long-term tracking; (2) temporal semantic learning for instrument understanding; and (3) ambiguity-resilient learning to mitigate annotation inconsistencies across multi-source datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning on SA-SV enables substantial performance gains, with SAM2 improving by 12.99 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$ over vanilla SAM2. SAM2S further advances performance to 80.42 average $\mathcal{J}$\&$\mathcal{F}$, surpassing vanilla and fine-tuned SAM2 by 17.10 and 4.11 points respectively, while maintaining 68 FPS real-time inference and strong zero-shot generalization.

Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法主要关注从头训练随机初始化模型，而当前最先进的视觉方法越来越多地基于大型预训练自监督模型，因此需要专门针对预训练模型线性探测的数据集蒸馏方法。

Abstract: The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on large, pre-trained self-supervised models rather than training from scratch. In this paper, we investigate the problem of distilling datasets that enable us to optimally train linear probes on top of such large, pre-trained vision models. We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统引导图像方法在低光场景下效果不佳，因为低光图像噪声高、亮度低，缺乏足够的特征用于引导上采样。

Method: 基于引导图像方法，通过多参数优化学习低光与明亮图像特征之间的关联，仅需少量样本图像对即可训练机器学习模型。

Result: 实验证明AGU在低光用例中优于现有最先进方法，能够实时生成高质量图像。

Conclusion: AGU通过多参数优化有效解决了低光图像引导上采样的挑战，实现了实时高质量图像渲染。

Abstract: We introduce Adaptive Guided Upsampling (AGU), an efficient method for upscaling low-light images capable of optimizing multiple image quality characteristics at the same time, such as reducing noise and increasing sharpness. It is based on a guided image method, which transfers image characteristics from a guidance image to the target image. Using state-of-the-art guided methods, low-light images lack sufficient characteristics for this purpose due to their high noise level and low brightness, rendering suboptimal/not significantly improved images in the process. We solve this problem with multi-parameter optimization, learning the association between multiple low-light and bright image characteristics. Our proposed machine learning method learns these characteristics from a few sample images-pairs. AGU can render high-quality images in real time using low-quality, low-resolution input; our experiments demonstrate that it is superior to state-of-the-art methods in the addressed low-light use case.

Conclusion: TRIM在不影响输出质量的前提下有效加速了3D高斯扩散模型的推理过程，支持推理时缩放。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian diffusion models suffer from time-intensive denoising and post-denoising processing due to the massive number of Gaussian primitives, resulting in slow generation and limited scalability along sampling trajectories. To improve the efficiency of 3D diffusion models, we propose $\textbf{TRIM}$ ($\textbf{T}$rajectory $\textbf{R}$eduction and $\textbf{I}$nstance $\textbf{M}$ask denoising), a post-training approach that incorporates both temporal and spatial trimming strategies, to accelerate inference without compromising output quality while supporting the inference-time scaling for Gaussian diffusion models. Instead of scaling denoising trajectories in a costly end-to-end manner, we develop a lightweight selector model to evaluate latent Gaussian primitives derived from multiple sampled noises, enabling early trajectory reduction by selecting candidates with high-quality potential. Furthermore, we introduce instance mask denoising to prune learnable Gaussian primitives by filtering out redundant background regions, reducing inference computation at each denoising step. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that TRIM significantly improves both the efficiency and quality of 3D generation.

Conclusion: 提出的解耦框架和双分支监督机制有效缓解了多层级冲突和类别不平衡问题，显著提升了3D分层语义分割性能

Abstract: 3D hierarchical semantic segmentation (3DHS) is crucial for embodied intelligence applications that demand a multi-grained and multi-hierarchy understanding of 3D scenes. Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art 3DHS performance, and its core components can also be used as a plug-and-play enhancement to improve previous methods.

TL;DR: Cambrian-S提出的视频空间超感知基准VSR和VSC存在缺陷，通过简单基线方法NoSense和VSC-Repeat实验证明这些基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对Cambrian-S提出的视频空间超感知基准和推理方法进行批判性分析，验证其是否真正衡量了空间认知能力。

Method: 1) 提出NoSense基线方法，仅使用SigLIP词袋模型，几乎丢弃所有时间结构；2) 设计VSC-Repeat实验，将视频重复拼接1-5次，测试系统对相同场景的识别能力。

Result: NoSense在VSR基准上达到95%准确率，证明无需空间认知即可解决该基准；VSC-Repeat实验中Cambrian-S准确率从42%降至0%，显示其依赖基准中的捷径启发式。

Conclusion: 当前VSI-Super基准无法可靠衡量空间超感知，Cambrian-S的推理方法通过利用基准捷径而非真正的空间超感知来提升性能。

Abstract: Cambrian-S aims to take the first steps towards improving video world models with spatial supersensing by introducing (i) two benchmarks, VSI-Super-Recall (VSR) and VSI-Super-Counting (VSC), and (ii) bespoke predictive sensing inference strategies tailored to each benchmark. In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims. We release our code at: https://github.com/bethgelab/supersanity

Abstract: With the increasing demand for 3D animation, generating high-fidelity, controllable 4D avatars from textual descriptions remains a significant challenge. Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.

Conclusion: SceneDesigner通过创新的网络架构、数据表示和训练策略，成功实现了精确灵活的多物体9自由度姿态控制，在可控性和生成质量上都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Controllable image generation has attracted increasing attention in recent years, enabling users to manipulate visual content such as identity and style. However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Overall, V-ReasonBench offers a unified and reproducible framework for measuring video reasoning and aims to support the development of models with more reliable, human-aligned reasoning skills.

Abstract: While language models have become impactful in many real-world applications, video generation remains largely confined to entertainment. Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context. To enable this learning, we craft VANS-Data-100K, a dedicated dataset for the VNEP task. Experiments on procedural and predictive benchmarks demonstrate that VANS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both video event prediction and visualization. Codes are released in https://github.com/KlingTeam/VANS.

Abstract: When confronted with complex problems, we tend to think slowly; conversely, for simple questions, we think quickly. Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges. However, existing reasoning-oriented visual language models (VLMs), whether trained with explicit chain-of-thought annotations or rule-based RL rewards, mainly pursue lengthy, detailed reasoning chains, which often lead to excessive computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking. Despite its simplicity, our model, named DualMindVLM, significantly outperforms the base model and achieves performance on par with state-of-the-art visual reasoning models, while maintaining exceptionally high token efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了EvoLMM框架，通过两个协作代理（提议者和解决者）在无监督方式下自我进化，提升大型多模态模型的推理能力，无需人工标注数据或奖励模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型的训练仍依赖人工标注数据或外部奖励模型，限制了自主性和可扩展性，需要探索完全无监督的自我改进方法。

Method: 从单一骨干模型实例化两个协作代理：提议者生成多样化的图像相关问题，解决者通过内部一致性解决这些问题，形成持续自我奖励的学习过程。

Result: 以Qwen2.5-VL为基础模型，在ChartQA、MathVista和MathVision等多模态数学推理基准上取得了约3%的性能提升，仅使用原始训练图像。

Conclusion: EvoLMM提供了一个简单有效的完全无监督自我改进框架，可作为未来自改进大型多模态模型研究的坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have enabled impressive reasoning and perception abilities, yet most existing training pipelines still depend on human-curated data or externally verified reward models, limiting their autonomy and scalability. In this work, we strive to improve LMM reasoning capabilities in a purely unsupervised fashion (without any annotated data or reward distillation). To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments. When using the popular Qwen2.5-VL as the base model, our EvoLMM yields consistent gains upto $\sim$3\% on multimodal math-reasoning benchmarks, including ChartQA, MathVista, and MathVision, using only raw training images. We hope our simple yet effective approach will serve as a solid baseline easing future research in self-improving LMMs in a fully-unsupervised fashion.

*Jing Wen,Alexander G. Schwing,Shenlong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NoPo-Avatar从单张或稀疏图像重建可动画3D人体化身，无需姿态输入，解决了传统方法依赖准确姿态估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖准确的相机姿态和人体姿态作为输入，但在实际应用中姿态估计往往存在噪声，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出NoPo-Avatar方法，完全从图像重建化身，不依赖任何姿态输入，避免了噪声姿态估计的影响。

Result: 在THuman2.0、XHuman和HuGe100K数据集上的实验表明，在无真实姿态的实际场景中优于现有基线，在有真实姿态的实验室场景中表现相当。

Conclusion: NoPo-Avatar通过消除对测试时姿态输入的依赖，提高了方法的实用性和鲁棒性，适用于更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: We tackle the task of recovering an animatable 3D human avatar from a single or a sparse set of images. For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate "ground-truth" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).

TL;DR: 本研究调查了多语言LLM中思维链推理的归因模式，发现归因分数过度强调最终推理步骤，结构化CoT提示主要对高资源拉丁语系语言有效，且受控扰动会降低模型准确性和归因一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多语言LLM中思维链推理的忠实性和可解释性，关注不同语言间的归因模式差异。

Method: 使用ContextCite进行步骤级归因和Inseq进行令牌级归因，在Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct模型上应用MGSM基准测试，并进行否定和干扰句的受控扰动实验。

Result: 归因分数在错误生成中过度强调最终推理步骤；结构化CoT提示主要提高高资源拉丁语系语言的准确性；受控扰动会降低模型准确性和归因一致性。

Conclusion: 思维链提示在多语言鲁棒性和解释透明度方面存在局限性。

Abstract: This study investigates the attribution patterns underlying Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in multilingual LLMs. While prior works demonstrate the role of CoT prompting in improving task performance, there are concerns regarding the faithfulness and interpretability of the generated reasoning chains. To assess these properties across languages, we applied two complementary attribution methods--ContextCite for step-level attribution and Inseq for token-level attribution--to the Qwen2.5 1.5B-Instruct model using the MGSM benchmark. Our experimental results highlight key findings such as: (1) attribution scores excessively emphasize the final reasoning step, particularly in incorrect generations; (2) structured CoT prompting significantly improves accuracy primarily for high-resource Latin-script languages; and (3) controlled perturbations via negation and distractor sentences reduce model accuracy and attribution coherence. These findings highlight the limitations of CoT prompting, particularly in terms of multilingual robustness and interpretive transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理理论基准主要关注错误信念任务和不对称信息推理，忽视了信念之外的其他心理状态以及丰富的非语言沟通。

Method: 利用专家策划的身体语言参考作为知识库，构建包含222种非语言线索和397种心理状态的视频数据集，并进行细粒度注释和人工验证。

Result: 当前AI系统在非语言线索解释方面表现显著不足，在检测任务上存在巨大性能差距，在解释任务中表现出过度解读模式。

Conclusion: 机器在理解非语言沟通方面仍面临重大挑战，需要进一步研究来提升心理理论能力。

Abstract: Our ability to interpret others' mental states through nonverbal cues (NVCs) is fundamental to our survival and social cohesion. While existing Theory of Mind (ToM) benchmarks have primarily focused on false-belief tasks and reasoning with asymmetric information, they overlook other mental states beyond belief and the rich tapestry of human nonverbal communication. We present Motion2Mind, a framework for evaluating the ToM capabilities of machines in interpreting NVCs. Leveraging an expert-curated body-language reference as a proxy knowledge base, we build Motion2Mind, a carefully curated video dataset with fine-grained nonverbal cue annotations paired with manually verified psychological interpretations. It encompasses 222 types of nonverbal cues and 397 mind states. Our evaluation reveals that current AI systems struggle significantly with NVC interpretation, exhibiting not only a substantial performance gap in Detection, as well as patterns of over-interpretation in Explanation compared to human annotators.

TL;DR: 提出了TOD-ProcBench基准，用于评估LLM在多轮任务导向对话中理解和遵循复杂过程指令的能力，包含三个任务：相关指令检索与动作预测、违规响应识别、条件生成指令遵循响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TOD基准将复杂指令简化为简单的意图、槽位和API调用配置，无法真实反映现实世界中代理需要严格遵循包含复杂约束的自然语言过程指令的需求。

Method: 基于高质量ABCD数据集构建包含复杂过程指令的基准，将细粒度约束和动作程序表述为多级条件-动作指令语句，设计三个任务全面评估LLM的复杂指令遵循能力。

Result: 创建了包含复杂过程指令的基准数据集，并设计了三个评估任务来系统性地测试LLM在多轮TOD中的指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: TOD-ProcBench填补了现有基准的不足，为评估LLM在现实任务导向对话中遵循复杂指令的能力提供了系统性的测试框架。

Abstract: In real-world task-oriented dialogue (TOD) settings, agents are required to strictly adhere to complex instructions while conducting multi-turn conversations with customers. These instructions are typically presented in natural language format and include general guidelines and step-by-step procedures with complex constraints. Existing TOD benchmarks often oversimplify the complex nature of these instructions by reducing them to simple schemas composed of intents, slots, and API call configurations. To address this gap and systematically benchmark LLMs' instruction-following capabilities, we propose TOD-ProcBench, a challenging benchmark featuring complex process instructions with intricate, fine-grained constraints that evaluates various LLMs' abilities to understand and follow instructions in multi-turn TODs. Our benchmark dataset comprises instruction documents derived from the high-quality ABCD dataset with corresponding conversations under human quality control. We formulate fine-grained constraints and action procedures as multi-level condition-action instruction statements. We design three tasks to comprehensively benchmark LLMs' complex instruction-following capabilities in multi-turn TODs. Task 1 evaluates how LLMs retrieve the most relevant statement from a complex instruction and predict the corresponding next action. In Task 2, we synthesize instruction-violating responses by injecting inconsistencies and manipulating the original instructions, and then we analyze how effectively LLMs can identify instruction-violating responses. Task 3 investigates LLMs' abilities in conditional generation of instruction-following responses based on the original complex instructions. Additionally, we conduct studies on the impact of multilingual settings and different instruction text formats on compliance performance. We release our benchmark under the Llama 3.3 Community License Agreement.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型谎言检测技术通常在狭窄环境中验证，无法捕捉模型可能生成的各种谎言类型，需要更全面的测试平台。

Method: 构建包含7个数据集、4个开源模型的72,863个谎言和诚实回答示例的测试平台，涵盖不同谎言类型，评估3种黑白盒谎言检测技术。

Result: 现有技术系统性地无法识别某些类型的谎言，特别是在仅凭对话记录无法确定模型是否撒谎的情况下表现更差。

Conclusion: LIARS' BENCH揭示了先前技术的局限性，为谎言检测的进展提供了实用的测试平台。

Abstract: Prior work has introduced techniques for detecting when large language models (LLMs) lie, that is, generating statements they believe are false. However, these techniques are typically validated in narrow settings that do not capture the diverse lies LLMs can generate. We introduce LIARS' BENCH, a testbed consisting of 72,863 examples of lies and honest responses generated by four open-weight models across seven datasets. Our settings capture qualitatively different types of lies and vary along two dimensions: the model's reason for lying and the object of belief targeted by the lie. Evaluating three black- and white-box lie detection techniques on LIARS' BENCH, we find that existing techniques systematically fail to identify certain types of lies, especially in settings where it's not possible to determine whether the model lied from the transcript alone. Overall, LIARS' BENCH reveals limitations in prior techniques and provides a practical testbed for guiding progress in lie detection.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在受控语言生成中使用可处理代理模型时存在的弱上下文感知问题，以及效率低下的问题。

Method: 使用基础语言模型进行丰富前缀编码，配合固定可处理代理模型计算精确的延续概率；通过单次批量HMM更新处理所有候选下一个标记，仅让代理模型的潜在状态先验依赖于LM的隐藏表示，保持代理解码器固定以实现计算复用。

Result: LTLA获得了比无条件HMM更高的条件似然，能够近似视觉语言模型的延续分布，在受控生成任务中提高了约束满足度且保持相当的流畅性，推理开销最小。

Conclusion: LTLA方法有效解决了受控语言生成中的上下文感知和效率问题，在保持高质量生成的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Controlled language generation conditions text on sequence-level constraints (for example, syntax, style, or safety). These constraints may depend on future tokens, which makes directly conditioning an autoregressive language model (LM) generally intractable. Prior work uses tractable surrogates such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to approximate the distribution over continuations and adjust the model's next-token logits at decoding time. However, we find that these surrogates are often weakly context aware, which reduces query quality. We propose Learning to Look Ahead (LTLA), a hybrid approach that pairs the same base language model for rich prefix encoding with a fixed tractable surrogate model that computes exact continuation probabilities. Two efficiency pitfalls arise when adding neural context: (i) naively rescoring the prefix with every candidate next token requires a sweep over the entire vocabulary at each step, and (ii) predicting fresh surrogate parameters for each prefix, although tractable at a single step, forces recomputation of future probabilities for every new prefix and eliminates reuse. LTLA avoids both by using a single batched HMM update to account for all next-token candidates at once, and by conditioning only the surrogate's latent state prior on the LM's hidden representations while keeping the surrogate decoder fixed, so computations can be reused across prefixes. Empirically, LTLA attains higher conditional likelihood than an unconditional HMM, approximates continuation distributions for vision-language models where a standalone HMM cannot encode visual context, and improves constraint satisfaction at comparable fluency on controlled-generation tasks, with minimal inference overhead.

Abstract: AI models like GPT-5 are an increasingly valuable tool for scientists, but many remain unaware of the capabilities of frontier AI. We present a collection of short case studies in which GPT-5 produced new, concrete steps in ongoing research across mathematics, physics, astronomy, computer science, biology, and materials science.

Of note, this paper includes four new results in mathematics (carefully verified by the human authors), underscoring how GPT-5 can help human mathematicians settle previously unsolved problems. These contributions are modest in scope but profound in implication, given the rate at which frontier AI is progressing.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) highly relies on crafted prompts. However, manual prompt engineering is a laborious process, creating a core bottleneck for practical application of LLMs. This phenomenon has led to the emergence of a new research area known as Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO), which develops rapidly in recent years. Existing APO methods such as those based on evolutionary algorithms or trial-and-error approaches realize an efficient and accurate prompt optimization to some extent. However, those researches focus on a single model or algorithm for the generation strategy and optimization process, which limits their performance when handling complex tasks. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Ensemble Learning based Prompt Optimization (ELPO) to achieve more accurate and robust results. Motivated by the idea of ensemble learning, ELPO conducts voting mechanism and introduces shared generation strategies along with different search methods for searching superior prompts. Moreover, ELPO creatively presents more efficient algorithms for the prompt generation and search process. Experimental results demonstrate that ELPO outperforms state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods across different tasks, e.g., improving F1 score by 7.6 on ArSarcasm dataset.

Motivation: 传统PEFT方法对所有位置索引都应用修改，但作者质疑这种全面修改的必要性，认为选择性修改可能更有效。

Method: 引入TS-PEFT方法，使用函数S选择性地对位置索引子集应用PEFT修改，而不是对所有位置进行修改。

Result: 实验结果表明，对所有索引不加选择地应用PEFT不仅多余，甚至可能适得其反。

Conclusion: 为PEFT提供了新视角，主张采用更有针对性的修改方法，并为未来优化大模型微调过程提供了框架。

Abstract: In the field of large models (LMs) for natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a resource-efficient method that modifies a limited number of parameters while keeping the pretrained weights fixed. This paper investigates the traditional PEFT approach, which applies modifications to all position indices, and questions its necessity. We introduce a new paradigm called Token-Selective PEFT (TS-PEFT), in which a function S selectively applies PEFT modifications to a subset of position indices, potentially enhancing performance on downstream tasks. Our experimental results reveal that the indiscriminate application of PEFT to all indices is not only superfluous, but may also be counterproductive. This study offers a fresh perspective on PEFT, advocating for a more targeted approach to modifications and providing a framework for future research to optimize the fine-tuning process for large models.

Abstract: Effective scientific communication depends on accurate citations that validate sources and guide readers to supporting evidence. Yet academic literature faces mounting challenges: semantic citation errors that misrepresent sources, AI-generated hallucinated references, and traditional citation formats that point to entire papers without indicating which sections substantiate specific claims. We introduce SemanticCite, an AI-powered system that verifies citation accuracy through full-text source analysis while providing rich contextual information via detailed reasoning and relevant text snippets. Our approach combines multiple retrieval methods with a four-class classification system (Supported, Partially Supported, Unsupported, Uncertain) that captures nuanced claim-source relationships and enables appropriate remedial actions for different error types. Our experiments show that fine-tuned lightweight language models achieve performance comparable to large commercial systems with significantly lower computational requirements, making large-scale citation verification practically feasible. The system provides transparent, evidence-based explanations that support user understanding and trust. We contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 1,000 citations with detailed alignments, functional classifications, semantic annotations, and bibliometric metadata across eight disciplines, alongside fine-tuned models and the complete verification framework as open-source software. SemanticCite addresses critical challenges in research integrity through scalable citation verification, streamlined peer review, and quality control for AI-generated content, providing an open-source foundation for maintaining citation accuracy at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的不确定性量化方法主要依赖语义概率分布或成对距离，忽略了潜在的语义结构信息，而这些信息可能实现更精确的不确定性估计。

Method: 开发自适应稀疏有向语义图构建算法，捕获方向性语义依赖并自动剪除引入负面干扰的连接；通过层次抽象利用潜在语义结构信息，将SeSE定义为最优语义编码树的结构熵；扩展SeSE以量化长文本生成中单个声明的不确定性。

Result: 在29个模型-数据集组合上的广泛实验表明，SeSE显著优于先进的不确定性量化基线，包括强监督方法和最近提出的KLE方法。

Conclusion: SeSE框架通过利用语义结构信息，为大语言模型提供了可靠的不确定性量化，在幻觉检测方面表现出色，为安全关键场景中的部署提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical scenarios, as it enables them to abstain from responding when uncertain, thereby avoiding hallucinating falsehoods. However, state-of-the-art UQ methods primarily rely on semantic probability distributions or pairwise distances, overlooking latent semantic structural information that could enable more precise uncertainty estimates. This paper presents Semantic Structural Entropy (SeSE), a principled UQ framework that quantifies the inherent semantic uncertainty of LLMs from a structural information perspective for hallucination detection. Specifically, to effectively model semantic spaces, we first develop an adaptively sparsified directed semantic graph construction algorithm that captures directional semantic dependencies while automatically pruning unnecessary connections that introduce negative interference. We then exploit latent semantic structural information through hierarchical abstraction: SeSE is defined as the structural entropy of the optimal semantic encoding tree, formalizing intrinsic uncertainty within semantic spaces after optimal compression. A higher SeSE value corresponds to greater uncertainty, indicating that LLMs are highly likely to generate hallucinations. In addition, to enhance fine-grained UQ in long-form generation -- where existing methods often rely on heuristic sample-and-count techniques -- we extend SeSE to quantify the uncertainty of individual claims by modeling their random semantic interactions, providing theoretically explicable hallucination detection. Extensive experiments across 29 model-dataset combinations show that SeSE significantly outperforms advanced UQ baselines, including strong supervised methods and the recently proposed KLE.

TL;DR: SDA是一个无需训练、模型无关的对齐框架，通过动态重分布模型输出概率来增强LLM与人类意图的对齐，在3H维度上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在现实应用中的广泛部署，确保模型响应与人类意图对齐成为基础挑战，特别是在推理过程中无需昂贵重训练或大量监督的情况下实现有效对齐。

Method: 提出SDA框架，基于用户定义的对齐指令动态重分布模型输出概率，无需微调即可增强模型行为与人类意图的对齐，支持个性化偏好对齐。

Result: 在8个不同规模和来源的开源LLM上评估，SDA在3H维度上平均提升：帮助性64.4%、诚实性30%、无害性11.5%，展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SDA是一种轻量级、资源高效的推理时对齐方法，可独立使用或与训练策略集成，有效提升LLM在多样化应用场景中的对齐性能。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), their deployment in real-world applications has become increasingly widespread. LLMs are expected to deliver robust performance across diverse tasks, user preferences, and practical scenarios. However, as demands grow, ensuring that LLMs produce responses aligned with human intent remains a foundational challenge. In particular, aligning model behavior effectively and efficiently during inference, without costly retraining or extensive supervision, is both a critical requirement and a non-trivial technical endeavor. To address the challenge, we propose SDA (Steering-Driven Distribution Alignment), a training-free and model-agnostic alignment framework designed for open-source LLMs. SDA dynamically redistributes model output probabilities based on user-defined alignment instructions, enhancing alignment between model behavior and human intents without fine-tuning. The method is lightweight, resource-efficient, and compatible with a wide range of open-source LLMs. It can function independently during inference or be integrated with training-based alignment strategies. Moreover, SDA supports personalized preference alignment, enabling flexible control over the model response behavior. Empirical results demonstrate that SDA consistently improves alignment performance across 8 open-source LLMs with varying scales and diverse origins, evaluated on three key alignment dimensions, helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (3H). Specifically, SDA achieves average gains of 64.4% in helpfulness, 30% in honesty and 11.5% in harmlessness across the tested models, indicating its effectiveness and generalization across diverse models and application scenarios.

Motivation: 传统强化学习仅关注最终正确性的奖励机制无法对内部推理过程提供详细监督，导致推理质量不佳，出现过度思考、思考不足、冗余思考和无序思考等问题。

Method: 提出选择性重写方法，仅对模型一致正确的"简单"样本进行重写，保持GRPO的所有原始奖励信号；在单个批次中同时进行重写和普通生成，仅增加约10%的开销。

Result: 在准确率-长度权衡方面，自我重写方法在显著减少推理长度(-46%)的同时提高了准确率(+0.6)；在内部推理质量方面，LLM作为评判者的评分显著提高(+7.2)，成功缓解了内部推理缺陷。

Conclusion: 自我重写框架有效改善了大型推理模型的内部推理质量，在保持强化学习算法可扩展性的同时实现了更好的准确率-长度权衡。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning (RL) with outcome correctness rewards, large reasoning models (LRMs) with scaled inference computation have demonstrated substantial success on complex reasoning tasks. However, the one-sided reward, focused solely on final correctness, limits its ability to provide detailed supervision over internal reasoning process. This deficiency leads to suboptimal internal reasoning quality, manifesting as issues like over-thinking, under-thinking, redundant-thinking, and disordered-thinking. Inspired by the recent progress in LRM self-rewarding, we introduce self-rewriting framework, where a model rewrites its own reasoning texts, and subsequently learns from the rewritten reasoning to improve the internal thought process quality. For algorithm design, we propose a selective rewriting approach wherein only "simple" samples, defined by the model's consistent correctness, are rewritten, thereby preserving all original reward signals of GRPO. For practical implementation, we compile rewriting and vanilla generation within one single batch, maintaining the scalability of the RL algorithm and introducing only ~10% overhead. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks with different model sizes validate the effectiveness of self-rewriting. In terms of the accuracy-length tradeoff, the self-rewriting approach achieves improved accuracy (+0.6) with substantially shorter reasoning (-46%) even without explicit instructions in rewriting prompts to reduce reasoning length, outperforming existing strong baselines. In terms of internal reasoning quality, self-rewriting achieves significantly higher scores (+7.2) under the LLM-as-a-judge metric, successfully mitigating internal reasoning flaws.

*Blake Matheny,Phuong Minh Nguyen,Minh Le Nguyen,Stephanie Reynolds*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文创建了大规模习语和比喻语言数据集，用于评估预训练语言模型处理比喻意义的能力，通过习语识别任务来提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语和比喻语言在口语和书面语中占比很大，但大型语言模型在处理这类语言时仍存在困难。虽然微调方法有效，但需要更大更好的数据集来缩小这一差距。

Method: 使用现有习语数据集获取习语列表，从大型语料库中检索上下文序列，创建了一个大规模潜在习语数据集和两个人工标注的确切习语数据集，用于模型训练和评估。

Result: 创建的数据集经过后处理以适应模型无关训练，并在槽位标注和序列标注任务中进行了训练和评估。

Conclusion: 本文提供的数据集为解决LLMs处理习语和比喻语言的挑战提供了有效工具，为开发新模型和方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Idiomatic and figurative language form a large portion of colloquial speech and writing. With social media, this informal language has become more easily observable to people and trainers of large language models (LLMs) alike. While the advantage of large corpora seems like the solution to all machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) problems, idioms and figurative language continue to elude LLMs. Finetuning approaches are proving to be optimal, but better and larger datasets can help narrow this gap even further. The datasets presented in this paper provide one answer, while offering a diverse set of categories on which to build new models and develop new approaches. A selection of recent idiom and figurative language datasets were used to acquire a combined idiom list, which was used to retrieve context sequences from a large corpus. One large-scale dataset of potential idiomatic and figurative language expressions and two additional human-annotated datasets of definite idiomatic and figurative language expressions were created to evaluate the baseline ability of pre-trained language models in handling figurative meaning through idiom recognition (detection) tasks. The resulting datasets were post-processed for model agnostic training compatibility, utilized in training, and evaluated on slot labeling and sequence tagging.

### [124] [Learning from Sufficient Rationales: Analysing the Relationship Between Explanation Faithfulness and Token-level Regularisation Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16353)
*Jonathan Kamp,Lisa Beinborn,Antske Fokkens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了自然语言解释（rationales）在模型评估中的作用，发现传统的充分性指标存在局限性，并分析了rationales在token分类和注意力正则化中的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估模型是否基于正确原因学习标签的rationales充分性指标提供的信息有限，需要更深入地理解rationales信息对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过将充分性与两种建模范式联系起来：模型识别rationales中token的能力（token分类）和通过将rationales纳入输入来提升模型性能的能力（注意力正则化）。

Result: 研究发现高度信息化的rationales不一定有助于正确分类实例；充分性反而捕捉了非rationalized上下文对分类的影响；将rationales信息纳入输入可以提升跨域分类，但结果因任务和模型类型而异；充分性与token分类似乎无关。

Conclusion: rationales的复杂性表明，需要开发能够系统捕捉这类信息的指标进行进一步研究。

Abstract: Human explanations of natural language, rationales, form a tool to assess whether models learn a label for the right reasons or rely on dataset-specific shortcuts. Sufficiency is a common metric for estimating the informativeness of rationales, but it provides limited insight into the effects of rationale information on model performance. We address this limitation by relating sufficiency to two modelling paradigms: the ability of models to identify which tokens are part of the rationale (through token classification) and the ability of improving model performance by incorporating rationales in the input (through attention regularisation). We find that highly informative rationales are not likely to help classify the instance correctly. Sufficiency conversely captures the classification impact of the non-rationalised context, which interferes with rationale information in the same input. We also find that incorporating rationale information in model inputs can boost cross-domain classification, but results are inconsistent per task and model type. Finally, sufficiency and token classification appear to be unrelated. These results exemplify the complexity of rationales, showing that metrics capable of systematically capturing this type of information merit further investigation.

TL;DR: MinerU-HTML是一个基于语言模型的HTML到文本提取管道，通过序列标注方法显著提升网页内容提取质量，特别是在保留结构化元素方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页语料库主要依赖启发式提取器（如Trafilatura），这些方法难以保留文档结构和结构化元素（如公式、代码、表格），而改进提取质量可能对下游性能产生与过滤策略同等重要的影响。

Method: 将内容提取重新定义为序列标注问题，使用0.6B参数的语言模型解决，采用两阶段格式化管道：先对语义元素进行明确分类，再转换为Markdown格式。

Result: 在MainWebBench基准测试中，MinerU-HTML获得81.8% ROUGE-N F1分数，显著优于Trafilatura的63.6%，在结构化元素保留方面表现突出（代码块90.9%，公式94.0%）。使用该方法构建的AICC语料库在预训练实验中表现优于其他语料库。

Conclusion: HTML提取是网页语料库构建中一个关键但常被低估的组件，基于模型的方法在提取质量和可扩展性方面优于启发式方法。

Abstract: While web data quality is crucial for large language models, most curation efforts focus on filtering and deduplication,treating HTML-to-text extraction as a fixed pre-processing step. Existing web corpora rely on heuristic-based extractors like Trafilatura, which struggle to preserve document structure and frequently corrupt structured elements such as formulas, codes, and tables. We hypothesize that improving extraction quality can be as impactful as aggressive filtering strategies for downstream performance. We introduce MinerU-HTML, a novel extraction pipeline that reformulates content extraction as a sequence labeling problem solved by a 0.6B-parameter language model. Unlike text-density heuristics, MinerU-HTML leverages semantic understanding and employs a two-stage formatting pipeline that explicitly categorizes semantic elements before converting to Markdown. Crucially, its model-based approach is inherently scalable, whereas heuristic methods offer limited improvement pathways. On MainWebBench, our benchmark of 7,887 annotated web pages, MinerU-HTML achieves 81.8\% ROUGE-N F1 compared to Trafilatura's 63.6\%, with exceptional structured element preservation (90.9\% for code blocks, 94.0\% for formulas). Using MinerU-HTML, we construct AICC (AI-ready Common Crawl), a 7.3-trillion token multilingual corpus from two Common Crawl snapshots. In controlled pretraining experiments where AICC and Trafilatura-extracted TfCC undergo identical filtering, models trained on AICC (62B tokens) achieve 50.8\% average accuracy across 13 benchmarks, outperforming TfCC by 1.08pp-providing direct evidence that extraction quality significantly impacts model capabilities. AICC also surpasses RefinedWeb and FineWeb on key benchmarks. We publicly release MainWebBench, MinerU-HTML, and AICC, demonstrating that HTML extraction is a critical, often underestimated component of web corpus construction.

Motivation: 探索机器学习和深度学习模型是否能够有效区分感知低质量与高质量新闻文章，以帮助自动识别新闻质量。

Method: 使用3个机器学习分类器和3个深度学习模型，基于新创建的1,412,272篇英语新闻文章数据集，使用194个语言特征进行网站级别的分类。

Result: 传统机器学习分类器（如随机森林）表现良好（准确率0.7355，ROC AUC 0.8131），而深度学习模型表现更优，ModernBERT-large达到最高准确率0.8744和ROC-AUC 0.9593。

Conclusion: 感知的全球新闻文章质量可以通过传统的基于CPU的机器学习分类器和深度学习分类器有效区分，深度学习模型表现更佳。

Abstract: This study explored whether supervised machine learning and deep learning models can effectively distinguish perceived lower-quality news articles from perceived higher-quality news articles. 3 machine learning classifiers and 3 deep learning models were assessed using a newly created dataset of 1,412,272 English news articles from the Common Crawl over 2018-2024. Expert consensus ratings on 579 source websites were split at the median, creating perceived low and high-quality classes of about 706,000 articles each, with 194 linguistic features per website-level labelled article. Traditional machine learning classifiers such as the Random Forest demonstrated capable performance (0.7355 accuracy, 0.8131 ROC AUC). For deep learning, ModernBERT-large (256 context length) achieved the best performance (0.8744 accuracy; 0.9593 ROC-AUC; 0.8739 F1), followed by DistilBERT-base (512 context length) at 0.8685 accuracy and 0.9554 ROC-AUC. DistilBERT-base (256 context length) reached 0.8478 accuracy and 0.9407 ROC-AUC, while ModernBERT-base (256 context length) attained 0.8569 accuracy and 0.9470 ROC-AUC. These results suggest that the perceived quality of worldwide news articles can be effectively differentiated by traditional CPU-based machine learning classifiers and deep learning classifiers.

Motivation: 研究动机是理解Transformer模型如何处理非组合性语言（如习语），探索模型在计算效率和鲁棒性之间的平衡机制。

Method: 采用改进的路径修补算法进行电路发现，识别和分析"习语头"（在多种习语中频繁激活的注意力头）以及"增强接收"（由于早期处理导致的习语标记间增强注意力）现象。

Result: 发现习语处理具有独特的计算模式，识别出特定的习语头，观察到习语标记间的增强注意力机制，揭示了Transformer平衡计算效率和鲁棒性的机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解Transformer处理非组合性语言提供了洞见，并为研究更复杂语法结构的处理提供了途径。

Abstract: We investigate the processing of idiomatic expressions in transformer-based language models using a novel set of techniques for circuit discovery and analysis. First discovering circuits via a modified path patching algorithm, we find that idiom processing exhibits distinct computational patterns. We identify and investigate ``Idiom Heads,'' attention heads that frequently activate across different idioms, as well as enhanced attention between idiom tokens due to earlier processing, which we term ``augmented reception.'' We analyze these phenomena and the general features of the discovered circuits as mechanisms by which transformers balance computational efficiency and robustness. Finally, these findings provide insights into how transformers handle non-compositional language and suggest pathways for understanding the processing of more complex grammatical constructions.

*Özay Ezerceli,Mahmoud El Hussieni,Selva Taş,Reyhan Bayraktar,Fatma Betül Terzioğlu,Yusuf Çelebi,Yağız Asker*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TurkColBERT是首个针对土耳其语检索的全面基准测试，比较了密集编码器和延迟交互模型。结果显示延迟交互模型在参数效率方面表现优异，小3-5倍的模型能显著超越密集编码器，并在特定领域任务中取得高达+13.8%的mAP提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经信息检索系统在高资源语言中表现出色，但对于形态丰富、资源较少的土耳其语研究不足。虽然密集双编码器目前在土耳其IR中占主导地位，但保留词元级表示进行细粒度匹配的延迟交互模型尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 采用两阶段适应流程：首先在土耳其NLI/STS任务上微调英语和多语言编码器，然后使用在MS MARCO-TR上训练的PyLate将其转换为ColBERT风格的检索器。评估了10个模型在5个土耳其BEIR数据集上的表现。

Result: 延迟交互模型展现出强大的参数效率：1.0M参数的colbert-hash-nano-tr比600M参数的turkish-e5-large小600倍，但保留了其平均mAP的71%以上。小3-5倍的延迟交互模型显著优于密集编码器；ColmmBERT-base-TR在特定领域任务中mAP提升高达+13.8%。

Conclusion: TurkColBERT为土耳其语检索提供了首个全面基准，证明延迟交互模型在参数效率和性能方面具有优势。MUVERA+Rerank索引算法比PLAID快3.33倍，并提供+1.7%的相对mAP增益，实现了低延迟检索。

Abstract: Neural information retrieval systems excel in high-resource languages but remain underexplored for morphologically rich, lower-resource languages such as Turkish. Dense bi-encoders currently dominate Turkish IR, yet late-interaction models -- which retain token-level representations for fine-grained matching -- have not been systematically evaluated. We introduce TurkColBERT, the first comprehensive benchmark comparing dense encoders and late-interaction models for Turkish retrieval. Our two-stage adaptation pipeline fine-tunes English and multilingual encoders on Turkish NLI/STS tasks, then converts them into ColBERT-style retrievers using PyLate trained on MS MARCO-TR. We evaluate 10 models across five Turkish BEIR datasets covering scientific, financial, and argumentative domains. Results show strong parameter efficiency: the 1.0M-parameter colbert-hash-nano-tr is 600$\times$ smaller than the 600M turkish-e5-large dense encoder while preserving over 71\% of its average mAP. Late-interaction models that are 3--5$\times$ smaller than dense encoders significantly outperform them; ColmmBERT-base-TR yields up to +13.8\% mAP on domain-specific tasks. For production-readiness, we compare indexing algorithms: MUVERA+Rerank is 3.33$\times$ faster than PLAID and offers +1.7\% relative mAP gain. This enables low-latency retrieval, with ColmmBERT-base-TR achieving 0.54 ms query times under MUVERA. We release all checkpoints, configs, and evaluation scripts. Limitations include reliance on moderately sized datasets ($\leq$50K documents) and translated benchmarks, which may not fully reflect real-world Turkish retrieval conditions; larger-scale MUVERA evaluations remain necessary.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型对于确保其安全有益部署至关重要，但由于LLM结构难以解释且无法对所有输出进行人工评估，这一任务变得复杂。

Method: 使用Mistral-7B模型，基于其激活状态来预测输入文本的体裁，采用scikit-learn分类器进行浅层学习。

Result: 在两个数据集上，体裁预测的F1分数分别达到98%和71%，结果始终优于对照任务。

Conclusion: 这提供了一个概念验证，表明可以通过浅层学习模型从LLM中推断文本体裁。

Abstract: Understanding Large Language Models (LLMs) is key to ensure their safe and beneficial deployment. This task is complicated by the difficulty of interpretability of LLM structures, and the inability to have all their outputs human-evaluated. In this paper, we present the first step towards a predictive framework, where the genre of a text used to prompt an LLM, is predicted based on its activations. Using Mistral-7B and two datasets, we show that genre can be extracted with F1-scores of up to 98% and 71% using scikit-learn classifiers. Across both datasets, results consistently outperform the control task, providing a proof of concept that text genres can be inferred from LLMs with shallow learning models.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了ASR评估中过度依赖WER的传统做法，发现WER等现有指标与临床影响相关性差，提出了基于LLM的自动化评估框架来替代专家临床评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ASR在临床对话中广泛应用，但评估仍主要依赖WER，需要验证这些指标是否能准确反映转录错误对临床实践的实际影响。

Method: 建立专家标注的黄金标准基准，让临床专家比较真实话语与ASR转录，标注临床影响；开发基于GEPA优化的LLM评估器来复制专家评估。

Result: WER和现有指标与临床风险标签相关性差；优化的LLM评估器（Gemini-2.5-Pro）达到90%准确率和0.816的Cohen's κ，性能与人类专家相当。

Conclusion: 提供了经过验证的自动化框架，推动ASR评估从简单的文本保真度转向必要的、可扩展的临床对话安全性评估。

Abstract: As Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) is increasingly deployed in clinical dialogue, standard evaluations still rely heavily on Word Error Rate (WER). This paper challenges that standard, investigating whether WER or other common metrics correlate with the clinical impact of transcription errors. We establish a gold-standard benchmark by having expert clinicians compare ground-truth utterances to their ASR-generated counterparts, labeling the clinical impact of any discrepancies found in two distinct doctor-patient dialogue datasets. Our analysis reveals that WER and a comprehensive suite of existing metrics correlate poorly with the clinician-assigned risk labels (No, Minimal, or Significant Impact). To bridge this evaluation gap, we introduce an LLM-as-a-Judge, programmatically optimized using GEPA to replicate expert clinical assessment. The optimized judge (Gemini-2.5-Pro) achieves human-comparable performance, obtaining 90% accuracy and a strong Cohen's $κ$ of 0.816. This work provides a validated, automated framework for moving ASR evaluation beyond simple textual fidelity to a necessary, scalable assessment of safety in clinical dialogue.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需人工标注训练数据的词义消歧方法，使用统计语言模型作为消歧器，将符号NLU系统生成的多候选含义转换为可区分的自然语言替代项，通过LLM选择给定上下文中的适当解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前词义消歧方法主要针对粗粒度表示，需要人工标注训练数据，难以自动消歧更丰富的表示（如基于OpenCyc的表示），这些表示对于复杂推理是必需的。

Method: 使用统计语言模型作为消歧器，将符号NLU系统生成的多候选含义转换为可区分的自然语言替代项，通过查询LLM在给定语言上下文中选择适当的解释，并将选定的含义传播回符号NLU系统。

Result: 通过与人工标注的金标准答案进行比较评估，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人工标注训练数据的词义消歧解决方案，能够处理更丰富的语义表示，为复杂推理任务提供了支持。

Abstract: Word sense disambiguation is a fundamental challenge in natural language understanding. Current methods are primarily aimed at coarse-grained representations (e.g. WordNet synsets or FrameNet frames) and require hand-annotated training data to construct. This makes it difficult to automatically disambiguate richer representations (e.g. built on OpenCyc) that are needed for sophisticated inference. We propose a method that uses statistical language models as oracles for disambiguation that does not require any hand-annotation of training data. Instead, the multiple candidate meanings generated by a symbolic NLU system are converted into distinguishable natural language alternatives, which are used to query an LLM to select appropriate interpretations given the linguistic context. The selected meanings are propagated back to the symbolic NLU system. We evaluate our method against human-annotated gold answers to demonstrate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态RAG系统依赖LLM将图像转换为文本摘要，导致视觉上下文信息丢失，影响下游检索和问答性能。

Method: 对两种检索方法进行对比分析：文本分块检索（图像先被LLM摘要为文本）和直接多模态嵌入检索（图像以原生方式存储在向量空间）。在包含40个问答对的金融财报基准上评估了6个LLM模型和2个多模态嵌入模型。

Result: 直接多模态嵌入检索显著优于基于LLM摘要的方法，在mAP@5上绝对提升13%（相对提升32%），在nDCG@5上绝对提升11%（相对提升20%），且能产生更准确和事实一致的答案。

Conclusion: LLM摘要会在预处理阶段引入信息损失，而直接多模态嵌入能够保留视觉上下文信息，为检索和推理提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to access multimodal knowledge bases containing both text and visual information such as charts, diagrams, and tables in financial documents. However, existing multimodal RAG systems rely on LLM-based summarization to convert images into text during preprocessing, storing only text representations in vector databases, which causes loss of contextual information and visual details critical for downstream retrieval and question answering. To address this limitation, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of two retrieval approaches for multimodal RAG systems, including text-based chunk retrieval (where images are summarized into text before embedding) and direct multimodal embedding retrieval (where images are stored natively in the vector space). We evaluate all three approaches across 6 LLM models and a two multi-modal embedding models on a newly created financial earnings call benchmark comprising 40 question-answer pairs, each paired with 2 documents (1 image and 1 text chunk). Experimental results demonstrate that direct multimodal embedding retrieval significantly outperforms LLM-summary-based approaches, achieving absolute improvements of 13% in mean average precision (mAP@5) and 11% in normalized discounted cumulative gain. These gains correspond to relative improvements of 32% in mAP@5 and 20% in nDCG@5, providing stronger evidence of their practical impact. We additionally find that direct multimodal retrieval produces more accurate and factually consistent answers as measured by LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons. We demonstrate that LLM summarization introduces information loss during preprocessing, whereas direct multimodal embeddings preserve visual context for retrieval and inference.

Conclusion: 该框架显著降低了多规模推理模型构建成本，实现了恒定内存的多合一推理模型部署。

Abstract: Training a family of large language models targeting multiple scales and deployment objectives is prohibitively expensive, requiring separate training runs for each different size. Recent work on model compression through pruning and knowledge distillation has reduced this cost; however, this process still incurs hundreds of billions of tokens worth of training cost per compressed model. In this paper, we present Nemotron Elastic, a framework for building reasoning-oriented LLMs, including hybrid Mamba-Attention architectures, that embed multiple nested submodels within a single parent model, each optimized for different deployment configurations and budgets. Each of these submodels shares weights with the parent model and can be extracted zero-shot during deployment without additional training or fine-tuning. We enable this functionality through an end-to-end trained router, tightly coupled to a two-stage training curriculum designed specifically for reasoning models. We additionally introduce group-aware SSM elastification that preserves Mamba's structural constraints, heterogeneous MLP elastification, normalized MSE-based layer importance for improved depth selection, and knowledge distillation enabling simultaneous multi-budget optimization. We apply Nemotron Elastic to the Nemotron Nano V2 12B model, simultaneously producing a 9B and a 6B model using only 110B training tokens; this results in over 360x cost reduction compared to training model families from scratch, and around 7x compared to SoTA compression techniques. Each of the nested models performs on par or better than the SoTA in accuracy. Moreover, unlike other compression methods, the nested capability of our approach allows having a many-in-one reasoning model that has constant deployment memory against the number of models in the family.

Result: 实现了用户能够操纵浸入流体中的物体，并感受到与流体-结构行为一致的反作用力。

Conclusion: 该框架通过将流体、软体和刚体动力学统一到单一平台，推进了触觉启用的多物理场模拟，适用于沉浸式教育应用。

Abstract: Haptic feedback enhances immersion in virtual environments by allowing users to physically interact with simulated objects. Supporting accurate force responses in multiphysics systems is challenging because physically based simulation of fluid, rigid, and deformable materials is computationally demanding, especially when interaction must occur in real time. We present a unified framework for real-time, bidirectional haptic interaction with rigid bodies, deformable objects, and Lagrangian fluids in virtual reality (VR). Our approach integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) with two-way force coupling and feedback smoothing to maintain stability and produce physically meaningful tactile responses. This enables users to manipulate objects immersed in fluid and feel reaction forces consistent with fluid-structure behavior. We demonstrate the capabilities of our framework through interactive VR scenarios involving fluid stirring, soft tissue manipulation, and rigid-body interaction. The proposed system advances haptic-enabled multiphysics simulation by unifying fluid, soft-body, and rigid-body dynamics into a single platform suitable for immersive educational applications.

TL;DR: 提出Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD)方法，实现栅格图像的细粒度可控多层分离，解决设计工作流中图层编辑不可逆的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计工作流中图层合成后无法进行图层级编辑，现有方法在可控性和分割精度方面存在局限。

Method: 包含两个关键模块：LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT)用于解耦图像元素到不同图层并实现细粒度控制；Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA)用于向多层token注入目标图像信息以实现精确条件生成。

Result: 实验结果表明CLD在分解质量和可控性方面均优于现有方法，分离出的图层可直接在常用设计工具中操作。

Conclusion: CLD方法在分解质量和可控性上表现优异，具有实际应用价值，可直接集成到现实创意工作流中。

Abstract: This work presents Controllable Layer Decomposition (CLD), a method for achieving fine-grained and controllable multi-layer separation of raster images. In practical workflows, designers typically generate and edit each RGBA layer independently before compositing them into a final raster image. However, this process is irreversible: once composited, layer-level editing is no longer possible. Existing methods commonly rely on image matting and inpainting, but remain limited in controllability and segmentation precision. To address these challenges, we propose two key modules: LayerDecompose-DiT (LD-DiT), which decouples image elements into distinct layers and enables fine-grained control; and Multi-Layer Conditional Adapter (MLCA), which injects target image information into multi-layer tokens to achieve precise conditional generation. To enable a comprehensive evaluation, we build a new benchmark and introduce tailored evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that CLD consistently outperforms existing methods in both decomposition quality and controllability. Furthermore, the separated layers produced by CLD can be directly manipulated in commonly used design tools such as PowerPoint, highlighting its practical value and applicability in real-world creative workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成大语言模型(eLLM)框架，通过整合多个LLM来解决单个模型的弱点，在文本分类任务中实现了高达65%的F1分数提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单个大语言模型在文本分类中存在的弱点，包括不一致性、幻觉、类别膨胀和错误分类问题。

Method: 采用集成学习框架，通过数学建模集体决策过程并建立原则性聚合标准，在IAB分层分类法下评估10个先进LLM。

Result: eLLM框架相比最强单模型性能提升高达65%，实现了接近人类专家水平的性能，显著减少了对人工标注的依赖。

Conclusion: eLLM框架为基于分类法的分类提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，能够显著提升文本分类的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: This study introduces an ensemble framework for unstructured text categorization using large language models (LLMs). By integrating multiple models, the ensemble large language model (eLLM) framework addresses common weaknesses of individual systems, including inconsistency, hallucination, category inflation, and misclassification. The eLLM approach yields a substantial performance improvement of up to 65\% in F1-score over the strongest single model. We formalize the ensemble process through a mathematical model of collective decision-making and establish principled aggregation criteria. Using the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) hierarchical taxonomy, we evaluate ten state-of-the-art LLMs under identical zero-shot conditions on a human-annotated corpus of 8{,}660 samples. Results show that individual models plateau in performance due to the compression of semantically rich text into sparse categorical representations, while eLLM improves both robustness and accuracy. With a diverse consortium of models, eLLM achieves near human-expert-level performance, offering a scalable and reliable solution for taxonomy-based classification that may significantly reduce dependence on human expert labeling.

Abstract: Modern large language model-based reasoning systems frequently recompute similar reasoning steps across tasks, wasting computational resources, inflating inference latency, and limiting reproducibility. These inefficiencies underscore the need for persistent reasoning mechanisms that can recall and reuse prior computational traces.
  We introduce Graph-Memoized Reasoning, a formal framework for representing, storing, and reusing reasoning workflows as graph-structured memory. By encoding past decision graphs and retrieving them through structural and semantic similarity, our approach enables compositional reuse of subgraphs across new reasoning tasks.
  We formulate an optimization objective that minimizes total reasoning cost regularized by inconsistency between stored and generated workflows, providing a theoretical foundation for efficiency-consistency trade-offs in intelligent systems. We outline a conceptual evaluation protocol aligned with the proposed optimization objective.
  This framework establishes the groundwork for interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-improving reasoning architectures, offering a step toward persistent memory in large-scale agentic systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体强化学习系统应用于安全关键领域，理解智能体决策原因和集体行为实现方式变得至关重要。现有可解释AI方法在多智能体环境中存在不足。

Method: MACIE框架结合结构因果模型、干预反事实和Shapley值，通过干预归因分数量化个体因果贡献，使用协同指标分离集体效应与个体贡献，并生成自然语言叙述提供可操作解释。

Result: 在四种MARL场景中验证，结果显示准确的结果归因（平均phi_i=5.07，标准差<0.05），在合作任务中检测到正向涌现（协同指数高达0.461），计算效率高（CPU上每个数据集0.79秒）。

Conclusion: MACIE独特地结合了因果严谨性、涌现量化和多智能体支持，同时保持实时使用的实用性，代表了向可解释、可信赖和可问责多智能体AI迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: As Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning systems are used in safety critical applications. Understanding why agents make decisions and how they achieve collective behavior is crucial. Existing explainable AI methods struggle in multi agent settings. They fail to attribute collective outcomes to individuals, quantify emergent behaviors, or capture complex interactions. We present MACIE Multi Agent Causal Intelligence Explainer, a framework combining structural causal models, interventional counterfactuals, and Shapley values to provide comprehensive explanations. MACIE addresses three questions. First, each agent's causal contribution using interventional attribution scores. Second, system level emergent intelligence through synergy metrics separating collective effects from individual contributions. Third, actionable explanations using natural language narratives synthesizing causal insights. We evaluate MACIE across four MARL scenarios: cooperative, competitive, and mixed motive. Results show accurate outcome attribution, mean phi_i equals 5.07, standard deviation less than 0.05, detection of positive emergence in cooperative tasks, synergy index up to 0.461, and efficient computation, 0.79 seconds per dataset on CPU. MACIE uniquely combines causal rigor, emergence quantification, and multi agent support while remaining practical for real time use. This represents a step toward interpretable, trustworthy, and accountable multi agent AI.

TL;DR: 该论文研究不同模态（文本和图像）如何影响模型在ARC-AGI任务中对网格特征的感知能力，发现结构化文本能精确捕捉坐标信息，图像能保持2D形状但受分辨率影响，结合两者可提升执行效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令优先系统在ARC-AGI任务中缺乏对编码方式如何影响模型感知的系统性分析，以及如何区分指令错误和执行错误。作者假设不同模态会形成感知瓶颈，从而影响网格特征的可靠感知。

Method: 使用加权集合分歧度量和两阶段推理流程，在九种文本和图像模态中分离感知与推理，比较不同表示方式对特征感知的影响。

Result: 结构化文本在稀疏特征上能提供精确坐标，图像能捕捉2D形状但对分辨率敏感，结合文本和图像能提升约8个感知点和0.20的中位相似度。

Conclusion: 将表示与transformer的归纳偏差对齐，并实现文本和图像之间的交叉验证，可以在不改变底层模型的情况下获得更准确的指令和更可靠的执行效果。

Abstract: ARC-AGI and ARC-AGI-2 measure generalization-through-composition on small color-quantized grids, and their prize competitions make progress on these harder held-out tasks a meaningful proxy for systematic generalization. Recent instruction-first systems translate grids into concise natural-language or DSL rules executed in generate-execute-select loops, yet we lack a principled account of how encodings shape model perception and how to separate instruction errors from execution errors. We hypothesize that modality imposes perceptual bottlenecks -- text flattens 2D structure into 1D tokens while images preserve layout but can introduce patch-size aliasing -- thereby shaping which grid features are reliably perceived. To test this, we isolate perception from reasoning across nine text and image modalities using a weighted set-disagreement metric and a two-stage reasoning pipeline, finding that structured text yields precise coordinates on sparse features, images capture 2D shapes yet are resolution-sensitive, and combining them improves execution (about 8 perception points; about 0.20 median similarity). Overall, aligning representations with transformer inductive biases and enabling cross-validation between text and image yields more accurate instructions and more reliable execution without changing the underlying model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在轨迹级别验证正确性，忽略了轮次级错误在训练中的传播问题，这限制了更强LLM代理的发展。

Method: 基于参数相关性构建函数图，使用多智能体框架模拟用户-助手-工具交互，并采用轮次级过滤去除错误步骤。

Result: 在ToolMind上微调的模型在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: ToolMind通过细粒度验证解决了错误传播问题，为开发更强大的LLM工具代理提供了高质量数据支持。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have developed rapidly in recent years to solve complex real-world problems using external tools. However, the scarcity of high-quality trajectories still hinders the development of stronger LLM agents. Most existing works on multi-turn dialogue synthesis validate correctness only at the trajectory level, which may overlook turn-level errors that can propagate during training and degrade model performance. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolMind, a large-scale, high-quality tool-agentic dataset with 160k synthetic data instances generated using over 20k tools and 200k augmented open-source data instances. Our data synthesis pipeline first constructs a function graph based on parameter correlations and then uses a multi-agent framework to simulate realistic user-assistant-tool interactions. Beyond trajectory-level validation, we employ fine-grained turn-level filtering to remove erroneous or suboptimal steps, ensuring that only high-quality reasoning traces are retained. This approach mitigates error amplification during training while preserving self-corrective reasoning signals essential for robust tool-use learning. Models fine-tuned on ToolMind show significant improvements over baselines on several benchmarks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Chain of Summaries (CoS)方法，通过类似黑格尔辩证法的迭代过程生成信息密集的通用摘要，解决LLM处理网页内容时面临的格式不友好和上下文长度限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越多地使用外部网页内容，但由于LLM不友好的格式和上下文长度限制，这些内容难以被有效消化。

Method: 受黑格尔辩证法启发，CoS方法迭代优化初始摘要（正题），通过质疑识别其局限性（反题），最终生成满足当前和未来信息需求的通用摘要（合题）。

Result: 在TriviaQA、TruthfulQA和SQUAD数据集上的实验表明，CoS比零样本LLM基线提升高达66%，比专业摘要方法如BRIO和PEGASUS提升高达27%。CoS生成的摘要使用更少的token，且与下游LLM无关。

Conclusion: CoS为网站维护者提供了一种有吸引力的选择，使其内容更易于LLM访问，同时保留人工监督的可能性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly using external web content. However, much of this content is not easily digestible by LLMs due to LLM-unfriendly formats and limitations of context length. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating general-purpose, information-dense summaries that act as plain-text repositories of web content. Inspired by Hegel's dialectical method, our approach, denoted as Chain of Summaries (CoS), iteratively refines an initial summary (thesis) by identifying its limitations through questioning (antithesis), leading to a general-purpose summary (synthesis) that can satisfy current and anticipate future information needs. Experiments on the TriviaQA, TruthfulQA, and SQUAD datasets demonstrate that CoS outperforms zero-shot LLM baselines by up to 66% and specialized summarization methods such as BRIO and PEGASUS by up to 27%. CoS-generated summaries yield higher Q&A performance compared to the source content, while requiring substantially fewer tokens and being agnostic to the specific downstream LLM. CoS thus resembles an appealing option for website maintainers to make their content more accessible for LLMs, while retaining possibilities for human oversight.

Abstract: This thesis explores a multimodal AI framework for enhancing construction safety through the combined analysis of textual and visual data. In safety-critical environments such as construction sites, accident data often exists in multiple formats, such as written reports, inspection records, and site imagery, making it challenging to synthesize hazards using traditional approaches. To address this, this thesis proposed a multimodal AI framework that combines text and image analysis to assist in identifying safety hazards on construction sites. Two case studies were consucted to evaluate the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) for automated hazard identification.The first case study introduces a hybrid pipeline that utilizes GPT 4o and GPT 4o mini to extract structured insights from a dataset of 28,000 OSHA accident reports (2000-2025). The second case study extends this investigation using Molmo 7B and Qwen2 VL 2B, lightweight, open-source VLMs. Using the public ConstructionSite10k dataset, the performance of the two models was evaluated on rule-level safety violation detection using natural language prompts. This experiment served as a cost-aware benchmark against proprietary models and allowed testing at scale with ground-truth labels. Despite their smaller size, Molmo 7B and Quen2 VL 2B showed competitive performance in certain prompt configurations, reinforcing the feasibility of low-resource multimodal systems for rule-aware safety monitoring.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, which requires ability to perceive and manipulate spatial relationships in the 3D world, is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence, yet remains a persistent challenge for Multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While existing surveys often categorize recent progress based on input modality (e.g., text, image, video, or 3D), we argue that spatial ability is not solely determined by the input format. Instead, our survey introduces a taxonomy that organizes spatial intelligence from cognitive aspect and divides tasks in terms of reasoning complexity, linking them to several cognitive functions. We map existing benchmarks across text only, vision language, and embodied settings onto this taxonomy, and review evaluation metrics and methodologies for assessing spatial reasoning ability. This cognitive perspective enables more principled cross-task comparisons and reveals critical gaps between current model capabilities and human-like reasoning. In addition, we analyze methods for improving spatial ability, spanning both training-based and reasoning-based approaches. This dual perspective analysis clarifies their respective strengths, uncovers complementary mechanisms. By surveying tasks, benchmarks, and recent advances, we aim to provide new researchers with a comprehensive understanding of the field and actionable directions for future research.

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often face substantial uncertainty due to noisy data, low-quality labels, and heterogeneous modality characteristics. These issues become especially critical in human-computer interaction settings, where data quality, semantic reliability, and annotation consistency vary across users and recording conditions. This thesis tackles these challenges by exploring uncertainty-resilient multimodal learning through consistency-guided cross-modal transfer. The central idea is to use cross-modal semantic consistency as a basis for robust representation learning. By projecting heterogeneous modalities into a shared latent space, the proposed framework mitigates modality gaps and uncovers structural relations that support uncertainty estimation and stable feature learning. Building on this foundation, the thesis investigates strategies to enhance semantic robustness, improve data efficiency, and reduce the impact of noise and imperfect supervision without relying on large, high-quality annotations. Experiments on multimodal affect-recognition benchmarks demonstrate that consistency-guided cross-modal transfer significantly improves model stability, discriminative ability, and robustness to noisy or incomplete supervision. Latent space analyses further show that the framework captures reliable cross-modal structure even under challenging conditions. Overall, this thesis offers a unified perspective on resilient multimodal learning by integrating uncertainty modeling, semantic alignment, and data-efficient supervision, providing practical insights for developing reliable and adaptive brain-computer interface systems.

Conclusion: RAG和多代理系统在工程专业课程中增强LLM性能具有潜力，为开发工程教育智能辅导系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility across a wide range of general tasks, their effectiveness often diminishes in domain-specific applications due to inherent knowledge gaps. Moreover, their performance typically declines when addressing complex problems that require multi-step reasoning and analysis. In response to these challenges, we propose leveraging both LLMs and AI agents to develop education assistants aimed at enhancing undergraduate learning in biomechanics courses that focus on analyzing the force and moment in the musculoskeletal system of the human body. To achieve our goal, we construct a dual-module framework to enhance LLM performance in biomechanics educational tasks: 1) we apply Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the specificity and logical consistency of LLM's responses to the conceptual true/false questions; 2) we build a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to solve calculation-oriented problems involving multi-step reasoning and code execution. Specifically, we evaluate the performance of several LLMs, i.e., Qwen-1.0-32B, Qwen-2.5-32B, and Llama-70B, on a biomechanics dataset comprising 100 true/false conceptual questions and problems requiring equation derivation and calculation. Our results demonstrate that RAG significantly enhances the performance and stability of LLMs in answering conceptual questions, surpassing those of vanilla models. On the other hand, the MAS constructed using multiple LLMs demonstrates its ability to perform multi-step reasoning, derive equations, execute code, and generate explainable solutions for tasks that require calculation. These findings demonstrate the potential of applying RAG and MAS to enhance LLM performance for specialized courses in engineering curricula, providing a promising direction for developing intelligent tutoring in engineering education.

Motivation: 单智能体方法在事件响应中生成模糊、不可用的推荐，无法满足生产系统的需求，需要探索更可靠的LLM应用架构。

Method: 开发了MyAntFarm.ai框架，通过348次对照试验比较单智能体副驾驶与多智能体系统在相同事件场景下的表现。

Result: 多智能体编排实现了100%可操作推荐率（单智能体仅1.7%），行动特异性提升80倍，解决方案正确性提升140倍，且质量零方差。

Conclusion: 多智能体编排不是性能优化，而是基于LLM的事件响应实现生产就绪的必要要求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) promise to accelerate incident response in production systems, yet single-agent approaches generate vague, unusable recommendations. We present MyAntFarm.ai, a reproducible containerized framework demonstrating that multi-agent orchestration fundamentally transforms LLM-based incident response quality. Through 348 controlled trials comparing single-agent copilot versus multi-agent systems on identical incident scenarios, we find that multi-agent orchestration achieves 100% actionable recommendation rate versus 1.7% for single-agent approaches, an 80 times improvement in action specificity and 140 times improvement in solution correctness. Critically, multi-agent systems exhibit zero quality variance across all trials, enabling production SLA commitments impossible with inconsistent single-agent outputs. Both architectures achieve similar comprehension latency (approx.40s), establishing that the architectural value lies in deterministic quality, not speed. We introduce Decision Quality (DQ), a novel metric capturing validity, specificity, and correctness properties essential for operational deployment that existing LLM metrics do not address. These findings reframe multi-agent orchestration from a performance optimization to a production-readiness requirement for LLM-based incident response. All code, Docker configurations, and trial data are publicly available for reproduction.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Risks associated with the use of AI, ranging from algorithmic bias to model hallucinations, have received much attention and extensive research across the AI community, from researchers to end-users. However, a gap exists in the systematic assessment of supply chain risks associated with the complex web of data sources, pre-trained models, agents, services, and other systems that contribute to the output of modern AI systems. This gap is particularly problematic when AI systems are used in critical applications, such as the food supply, healthcare, utilities, law, insurance, and transport.
  We survey the current state of AI risk assessment and management, with a focus on the supply chain of AI and risks relating to the behavior and outputs of the AI system. We then present a proposed taxonomy specifically for categorizing AI supply chain entities. This taxonomy helps stakeholders, especially those without extensive AI expertise, to "consider the right questions" and systematically inventory dependencies across their organization's AI systems. Our contribution bridges a gap between the current state of AI governance and the urgent need for actionable risk assessment and management of AI use in critical applications.

Abstract: Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals.

TL;DR: IMACT-CXR是一个交互式多智能体对话导师系统，通过整合空间标注、视线分析、知识检索和图像推理，帮助学员解读胸部X光片。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个能够统一处理学员的边界框标注、视线样本和自由文本观察的智能导师系统，提升胸部X光片解读的培训效果。

Method: 基于AutoGen的多智能体工作流，包含定位质量评估、苏格拉底式辅导、PubMed证据检索、相似案例推荐等专门智能体，使用贝叶斯知识追踪和肺叶分割模块。

Result: 系统展示了响应式辅导流程、可控的答案泄露和可扩展性，初步评估显示相比基线方法在定位和诊断推理方面有所改进。

Conclusion: IMACT-CXR为胸部X光片解读培训提供了一个有效的交互式导师系统，具备实时部署的潜力。

Abstract: IMACT-CXR is an interactive multi-agent conversational tutor that helps trainees interpret chest X-rays by unifying spatial annotation, gaze analysis, knowledge retrieval, and image-grounded reasoning in a single AutoGen-based workflow. The tutor simultaneously ingests learner bounding boxes, gaze samples, and free-text observations. Specialized agents evaluate localization quality, generate Socratic coaching, retrieve PubMed evidence, suggest similar cases from REFLACX, and trigger NV-Reason-CXR-3B for vision-language reasoning when mastery remains low or the learner explicitly asks. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) maintains skill-specific mastery estimates that drive both knowledge reinforcement and case similarity retrieval. A lung-lobe segmentation module derived from a TensorFlow U-Net enables anatomically aware gaze feedback, and safety prompts prevent premature disclosure of ground-truth labels. We describe the system architecture, implementation highlights, and integration with the REFLACX dataset for real DICOM cases. IMACT-CXR demonstrates responsive tutoring flows with bounded latency, precise control over answer leakage, and extensibility toward live residency deployment. Preliminary evaluation shows improved localization and diagnostic reasoning compared to baselines.

Motivation: 当前AI系统难以应对现实世界决策中的相互关联挑战，如多目标优化、主动学习、长期规划和空间推理，而现有基准测试无法全面评估整体决策能力。

Method: 开发了Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs)模拟器，统一了环境建模、不确定性下的长期后果预测和复杂商业战略运营等挑战，并提供人类基线和最先进LLM智能体的综合评估。

Result: 人类在简单模式下表现优于AI系统6.5倍，中等模式下优于9.8倍。分析揭示了AI在长期优化、样本高效学习、空间推理和世界建模方面的持续弱点。

Conclusion: MAPs通过在一个环境中统一这些挑战，为评估具有适应性决策能力的智能体提供了新的基准基础。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in artificial intelligence, current systems struggle with the interconnected challenges that define real-world decision making. Practical domains, such as business management, require optimizing an open-ended and multi-faceted objective, actively learning environment dynamics from sparse experience, planning over long horizons in stochastic settings, and reasoning over spatial information. Yet existing human--AI benchmarks isolate subsets of these capabilities, limiting our ability to assess holistic decision-making competence. We introduce Mini Amusement Parks (MAPs), an amusement-park simulator designed to evaluate an agent's ability to model its environment, anticipate long-term consequences under uncertainty, and strategically operate a complex business. We provide human baselines and a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLM agents, finding that humans outperform these systems by 6.5x on easy mode and 9.8x on medium mode. Our analysis reveals persistent weaknesses in long-horizon optimization, sample-efficient learning, spatial reasoning, and world modelling. By unifying these challenges within a single environment, MAPs offers a new foundation for benchmarking agents capable of adaptable decision making. Code: https://github.com/Skyfall-Research/MAPs

Motivation: 解决音频语言模型中存在的悖论：推理过程反而降低性能，探究音频智能是否能真正受益于深思熟虑。

Method: 提出模态接地推理蒸馏（MGRD）框架，让模型学习生成基于声学特征的音频相关推理链，避免产生脱离实际的推理。

Result: 模型在涵盖语音、环境声音和音乐的全面音频理解和推理基准测试中表现出强大的音频推理能力。

Conclusion: 推理是跨模态可转移的能力，当适当锚定时，扩展的深思熟虑可以从负担转变为音频智能的强大资产。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated remarkable success in text and vision domains through extended chain-of-thought deliberation. However, a perplexing phenomenon persists in audio language models: they consistently perform better with minimal or no reasoning, raising a fundamental question - can audio intelligence truly benefit from deliberate thinking? We introduce Step-Audio-R1, the first audio reasoning model that successfully unlocks reasoning capabilities in the audio domain. Through our proposed Modality-Grounded Reasoning Distillation (MGRD) framework, Step-Audio-R1 learns to generate audio-relevant reasoning chains that genuinely ground themselves in acoustic features rather than hallucinating disconnected deliberations. Our model exhibits strong audio reasoning capabilities, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Pro and achieving performance comparable to the state-of-the-art Gemini 3 Pro across comprehensive audio understanding and reasoning benchmarks spanning speech, environmental sounds, and music. These results demonstrate that reasoning is a transferable capability across modalities when appropriately anchored, transforming extended deliberation from a liability into a powerful asset for audio intelligence. By establishing the first successful audio reasoning model, Step-Audio-R1 opens new pathways toward building truly multimodal reasoning systems that think deeply across all sensory modalities.

Motivation: 理解激活引导如何改变LLM内部机制以提升心理理论能力，揭示成功心理理论的内在认知过程

Method: 使用对比激活加法引导Gemma-3-4B模型，在1000个BigToM前向信念场景中评估，通过45个认知行为的线性探针分析激活差异

Result: 信念归因任务准确率从32.5%提升至46.7%，情感感知(+2.23)和情感价值(+2.20)激活增强，而质疑(-0.78)和聚合思维(-1.59)等分析过程被抑制

Conclusion: LLM成功心理理论能力主要由情感理解而非分析推理介导

Abstract: Recent work shows activation steering substantially improves language models' Theory of Mind (ToM) (Bortoletto et al. 2024), yet the mechanisms of what changes occur internally that leads to different outputs remains unclear. We propose decomposing ToM in LLMs by comparing steered versus baseline LLMs' activations using linear probes trained on 45 cognitive actions. We applied Contrastive Activation Addition (CAA) steering to Gemma-3-4B and evaluated it on 1,000 BigToM forward belief scenarios (Gandhi et al. 2023), we find improved performance on belief attribution tasks (32.5\% to 46.7\% accuracy) is mediated by activations processing emotional content : emotion perception (+2.23), emotion valuing (+2.20), while suppressing analytical processes: questioning (-0.78), convergent thinking (-1.59). This suggests that successful ToM abilities in LLMs are mediated by emotional understanding, not analytical reasoning.

Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖最终答案正确性，无法有效检测推理过程中的不可靠和不忠实推理，需要实时检测和缓解幻觉

Method: 利用自我评估置信度对齐和词元级熵峰值作为不确定性信号，设计复合奖励函数，通过强化学习策略引导模型生成行为

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了最终答案准确性和推理校准度，消融实验验证了各信号的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的自校正框架能有效改善大语言模型在多步推理中的准确性和可靠性

Abstract: This project develops a self correcting framework for large language models (LLMs) that detects and mitigates hallucinations during multi-step reasoning. Rather than relying solely on final answer correctness, our approach leverages fine grained uncertainty signals: 1) self-assessed confidence alignment, and 2) token-level entropy spikes to detect unreliable and unfaithful reasoning in real time. We design a composite reward function that penalizes unjustified high confidence and entropy spikes, while encouraging stable and accurate reasoning trajectories. These signals guide a reinforcement learning (RL) policy that makes the model more introspective and shapes the model's generation behavior through confidence-aware reward feedback, improving not just outcome correctness but the coherence and faithfulness of their intermediate reasoning steps. Experiments show that our method improves both final answer accuracy and reasoning calibration, with ablations validating the individual contribution of each signal.

Motivation: 现有LLM-as-a-judge框架依赖答案比较，难以实现细粒度和可扩展的推理输出评估，需要更直接和自动化的评判方法

Method: JudgeBoard直接查询模型评估答案正确性，无需额外答案比较；MAJ框架利用多个具有不同推理特征的SLM通过协作审议来近似LLM级评判准确性

Result: 实验显示SLM与LLM在独立评判任务中存在显著性能差距，但MAJ框架显著提高了SLM的可靠性和一致性，在MATH数据集上使用较小模型甚至优于较大模型

Conclusion: 多智能体SLM系统在评判任务中可能匹配或超越LLM性能，为可扩展和高效评估提供了新的可能性

Abstract: While small language models (SLMs) have shown promise on various reasoning tasks, their ability to judge the correctness of answers remains unclear compared to large language models (LLMs). Prior work on LLM-as-a-judge frameworks typically relies on comparing candidate answers against ground-truth labels or other candidate answers using predefined metrics like entailment. However, this approach is inherently indirect and difficult to fully automate, offering limited support for fine-grained and scalable evaluation of reasoning outputs. In this work, we propose JudgeBoard, a novel evaluation pipeline that directly queries models to assess the correctness of candidate answers without requiring extra answer comparisons. We focus on two core reasoning domains: mathematical reasoning and science/commonsense reasoning, and construct task-specific evaluation leaderboards using both accuracy-based ranking and an Elo-based rating system across five benchmark datasets, enabling consistent model comparison as judges rather than comparators. To improve judgment performance in lightweight models, we propose MAJ (Multi-Agent Judging), a novel multi-agent evaluation framework that leverages multiple interacting SLMs with distinct reasoning profiles to approximate LLM-level judgment accuracy through collaborative deliberation. Experimental results reveal a significant performance gap between SLMs and LLMs in isolated judging tasks. However, our MAJ framework substantially improves the reliability and consistency of SLMs. On the MATH dataset, MAJ using smaller-sized models as backbones performs comparatively well or even better than their larger-sized counterparts. Our findings highlight that multi-agent SLM systems can potentially match or exceed LLM performance in judgment tasks, with implications for scalable and efficient assessment.

TL;DR: KRAL是一种低成本、可扩展、保护隐私的范式，通过教师模型推理自动蒸馏知识和推理轨迹，使用启发式学习进行半监督数据增强，并利用代理强化学习共同增强医学知识和推理能力，显著优于传统RAG和SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在临床决策中的局限性，包括知识差距、数据隐私问题、高部署成本和有限推理能力，为复杂医疗决策支持提供低成本、高安全性的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识推理增强学习范式，包括：1）通过答案到问题的反向生成自动蒸馏知识和推理轨迹；2）启发式学习进行半监督数据增强；3）代理强化学习联合增强医学知识和推理能力；4）分层评估降低评估成本；5）模块化接口设计便于系统更新。

Result: 在外部开源基准MEDQA上，知识问答能力（Accuracy@1）比SFT提高1.8%，比RAG提高3.6%；在外部基准PUMCH Antimicrobial上，推理能力（Pass@1）比SFT提高27%，比RAG提高27.2%，长期训练成本仅为SFT的约20%。

Conclusion: KRAL是增强本地LLM临床诊断能力的有效解决方案，能够在复杂医疗决策支持中实现低成本、高安全性的部署。

Abstract: Clinical antimicrobial therapy requires the dynamic integration of pathogen profiles, host factors, pharmacological properties of antimicrobials, and the severity of infection.This complexity imposes fundamental limitations on the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high-stakes clinical decision-making including knowledge gaps, data privacy concerns, high deployment costs, and limited reasoning capabilities. To address these challenges, we propose KRAL (Knowledge and Reasoning Augmented Learning), a low-cost, scalable, privacy-preserving paradigm that leverages teacher-model reasoning to automatically distill knowledge and reasoning trajectories via answer-to-question reverse generation, employs heuristic learning for semi-supervised data augmentation (reducing manual annotation requirements by approximately 80%), and utilizes agentic reinforcement learning to jointly enhance medical knowledge and reasoning while optimizing computational and memory efficiency. A hierarchical evaluation employing diverse teacher-model proxies reduces assessment costs, while modular interface design facilitates seamless system updates. Experimental results demonstrate that KRAL significantly outperforms traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) methods. It improves knowledge question-answering capability (Accuracy@1 on the external open-source benchmark MEDQA increased by 1.8% vs. SFT and 3.6% vs. RAG) and reasoning capability (Pass@1 on the external benchmark PUMCH Antimicrobial increased by 27% vs. SFT and 27.2% vs. RAG), achieved at ~20% of SFT's long-term training costs. This establishes KRAL as an effective solution for enhancing local LLMs' clinical diagnostic capabilities, enabling low-cost, high-safety deployment in complex medical decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型可能被植入后门，在特定部署条件下表现出恶意行为，这种现象被称为"卧底代理"。现有安全训练无法消除这些后门，且缺乏实用的检测方法。

Method: 使用Sentence-BERT嵌入测量与安全基线的语义偏差，结合注入的金丝雀问题监控响应一致性，形成双重检测系统。

Result: 在官方Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B卧底代理模型上，系统达到92.5%准确率、100%精确度（零误报）和85%召回率，实时运行（每查询<1秒）。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了AI部署中的关键安全漏洞，证明基于嵌入的检测可以有效识别欺骗性模型行为，同时不牺牲部署效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be backdoored to exhibit malicious behavior under specific deployment conditions while appearing safe during training a phenomenon known as "sleeper agents." Recent work by Hubinger et al. demonstrated that these backdoors persist through safety training, yet no practical detection methods exist. We present a novel dual-method detection system combining semantic drift analysis with canary baseline comparison to identify backdoored LLMs in real-time. Our approach uses Sentence-BERT embeddings to measure semantic deviation from safe baselines, complemented by injected canary questions that monitor response consistency. Evaluated on the official Cadenza-Labs dolphin-llama3-8B sleeper agent model, our system achieves 92.5% accuracy with 100% precision (zero false positives) and 85% recall. The combined detection method operates in real-time (<1s per query), requires no model modification, and provides the first practical solution to LLM backdoor detection. Our work addresses a critical security gap in AI deployment and demonstrates that embedding-based detection can effectively identify deceptive model behavior without sacrificing deployment efficiency.

Method: 使用Written Exposure Therapy (WET)指南作为测试平台，评估模型对临床问题的响应，并提出评估框架来衡量准确性、一致性和推理忠实性。

Result: 发现即使提供权威段落，错误仍然存在；检索增强生成(RAG)可以约束输出，但安全部署需要严格评估推理。

Conclusion: 在临床环境中部署LLMs时，需要像评估检索一样严格评估推理过程，以确保输出的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Access to the right evidence does not guarantee that large language models (LLMs) will reason with it correctly. This gap between retrieval and reasoning is especially concerning in clinical settings, where outputs must align with structured protocols. We study this gap using Written Exposure Therapy (WET) guidelines as a testbed. In evaluating model responses to curated clinician-vetted questions, we find that errors persist even when authoritative passages are provided. To address this, we propose an evaluation framework that measures accuracy, consistency, and fidelity of reasoning. Our results highlight both the potential and the risks: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can constrain outputs, but safe deployment requires assessing reasoning as rigorously as retrieval.

Abstract: Sensorium Arc (AI reflects on climate) is a real-time multimodal interactive AI agent system that personifies the ocean as a poetic speaker and guides users through immersive explorations of complex marine data. Built on a modular multi-agent system and retrieval-augmented large language model (LLM) framework, Sensorium enables natural spoken conversations with AI agents that embodies the ocean's perspective, generating responses that blend scientific insight with ecological poetics. Through keyword detection and semantic parsing, the system dynamically triggers data visualizations and audiovisual playback based on time, location, and thematic cues drawn from the dialogue. Developed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of the Force Majeure and inspired by the eco-aesthetic philosophy of Newton Harrison, Sensorium Arc reimagines ocean data not as an abstract dataset but as a living narrative. The project demonstrates the potential of conversational AI agents to mediate affective, intuitive access to high-dimensional environmental data and proposes a new paradigm for human-machine-ecosystem.

MuseKG constructs a typed property graph linking objects, people, organisations, and visual or textual labels, and supports natural language queries. Evaluations on real museum collections demonstrate robust performance across queries over attributes, relations, and related entities, surpassing large-language-model zero-shot, few-shot and SPARQL prompt baselines.

Result: 在近5000个实例上的计算实验表明，新模型在最多100个作业的小到中型实例上表现优越，在最多500个作业、10个族、10台机器的大规模实例上，能够找到比现有方法好25%的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的新约束规划模型在串行批处理调度问题上显著优于现有的混合整数规划、禁忌搜索元启发式和约束规划方法，特别是在处理最小批次大小约束时表现出色。

Abstract: In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs), are fundamentally transforming accounting research, creating both opportunities and competitive threats for scholars. This paper proposes a framework that classifies AI-accounting research along two dimensions: research focus (accounting-centric versus AI-centric) and methodological approach (AI-based versus traditional methods). We apply this framework to papers from the IJAIS special issue and recent AI-accounting research published in leading accounting journals to map existing studies and identify research opportunities. Using this same framework, we analyze how accounting researchers can leverage their expertise through strategic positioning and collaboration, revealing where accounting scholars' strengths create the most value. We further examine how GenAI and LLMs transform the research process itself, comparing the capabilities of human researchers and AI agents across the entire research workflow. This analysis reveals that while GenAI democratizes certain research capabilities, it simultaneously intensifies competition by raising expectations for higher-order contributions where human judgment, creativity, and theoretical depth remain valuable. These shifts call for reforming doctoral education to cultivate comparative advantages while building AI fluency.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Old cloud edge workload resource management is too reactive. The problem with relying on static thresholds is that we are either overspending for more resources than needed or have reduced performance because of their lack. This is why we work on proactive solutions. A framework developed for it stops reacting to the problems but starts expecting them. We design a hybrid architecture, combining two powerful tools: the CNN LSTM model for time series forecasting and an orchestrator based on multi agent Deep Reinforcement Learning In fact the novelty is in how we combine them as we embed the predictive forecast from the CNN LSTM directly into the DRL agent state space. That is what makes the AI manager smarter it sees the future, which allows it to make better decisions about a long term plan for where to run tasks That means finding that sweet spot between how much money is saved while keeping the system healthy and apps fast for users That is we have given it eyes in order to see down the road so that it does not have to lurch from one problem to another it finds a smooth path forward Our tests show our system easily beats the old methods It is great at solving tough problems like making complex decisions and juggling multiple goals at once like being cheap fast and reliable

TL;DR: SkyRL-Agent是一个用于高效多轮长视野智能体训练和评估的框架，通过异步调度、轻量级工具集成和灵活后端互操作性，显著提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有智能体训练框架在效率、工具集成和跨框架兼容性方面的不足，开发一个能够支持高效多轮长视野训练的通用框架。

Method: 采用优化的异步流水线调度器（1.55倍加速），结合基于AST的代码搜索工具增强训练配方，使用纯强化学习从Qwen3-32B训练SA-SWE-32B软件工程智能体。

Result: SA-SWE-32B在SWE-Bench Verified上达到39.4% Pass@1，相比达到相似性能的先前模型成本降低2倍以上，并能有效泛化到其他智能体任务。

Conclusion: SkyRL-Agent框架通过高效调度和工具增强训练，成功实现了高性能软件工程智能体的训练，并展示了在多种智能体任务上的良好扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce SkyRL-Agent, a framework for efficient, multi-turn, long-horizon agent training and evaluation. It provides efficient asynchronous dispatching, lightweight tool integration, and flexible backend interoperability, enabling seamless use with existing RL frameworks such as SkyRL-train, VeRL, and Tinker.
  Using SkyRL-Agent, we train SA-SWE-32B, a software engineering agent trained from Qwen3-32B (24.4% Pass@1) purely with reinforcement learning. We introduce two key components: an optimized asynchronous pipeline dispatcher that achieves a 1.55x speedup over naive asynchronous batching, and a tool-enhanced training recipe leveraging an AST-based search tool to facilitate code navigation, boost rollout Pass@K, and improve training efficiency. Together, these optimizations enable SA-SWE-32B to reach 39.4% Pass@1 on SWE-Bench Verified with more than 2x cost reduction compared to prior models reaching similar performance. Despite being trained solely on SWE tasks, SA-SWE-32B generalizes effectively to other agentic tasks, including Terminal-Bench, BrowseComp-Plus, and WebArena. We further demonstrate SkyRL-Agent's extensibility through case studies on deep research, computer use, and memory agents, each trained using a different training backend.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MR-RML框架，通过GPRC方法解决LLM在医疗领域的对齐挑战，显著提升医疗基准测试性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在医疗实践中的实际效用受到三个关键对齐挑战的限制：静态评估与动态临床认知需求脱节、难以适应不断发展的多源医疗标准、传统奖励模型无法捕捉多维医疗质量标准

Method: 提出MR-RML框架，包含三个核心创新：维度-场景-学科医疗标准系统、独立多维奖励模型、几何投影参考约束，将医疗认知逻辑转化为数学正则化

Result: 在权威医疗基准Healthbench上，相比基础模型Qwen-32B，在完整子集上提升45%，在困难子集上提升85%，达到开源LLM中的SOTA水平

Conclusion: MR-RML框架有效解决了LLM在医疗领域的对齐问题，显著提升了临床实用性，为医疗AI的发展提供了新方向

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into medical practice holds transformative potential, yet their real-world clinical utility remains limited by critical alignment challenges: (1) a disconnect between static evaluation benchmarks and dynamic clinical cognitive needs, (2) difficulties in adapting to evolving, multi-source medical standards, and (3) the inability of conventional reward models to capture nuanced, multi-dimensional medical quality criteria. To address these gaps, we propose MR-RML (Multidimensional Rubric-oriented Reward Model Learning) via GPRC (Geometric Projection Reference Constraints), a novel alignment framework that integrates medical standards into a structured "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" matrix to guide data generation and model optimization. MR-RML introduces three core innovations: (1) a "Dimensions-Scenarios-Disciplines" medical standard system that embeds domain standards into the full training pipeline; (2) an independent multi-dimensional reward model that decomposes evaluation criteria, shifting from real-time rubric-based scoring to internalized reward modeling for improved consistency and cost-efficiency; (3) geometric projection reference constraints that transform medical cognitive logic into mathematical regularization, aligning scoring gradients with clinical reasoning and enabling synthetic data-driven training. Through extensive evaluations on the authoritative medical benchmark Healthbench, our method yields substantial performance gains over the base LLM Qwen-32B (45% on the full subset and 85% on Hard subset, respectively). It achieves a SOTA among open-source LLMs with scores of 62.7 (full subset) and 44.7 (hard subset), while also outperforming the majority of closed-source models.

TL;DR: 提出了FOOTPASS数据集，这是首个面向足球比赛全场逐场动作识别的基准数据集，结合计算机视觉输出和足球战术知识，用于生成可靠的逐场数据流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的动作识别方法不足以构建可靠的逐场数据，通常只能辅助而非完全自动化标注。同时战术建模、轨迹预测等研究需要基于比赛状态和逐场数据，因此需要利用战术知识作为先验来支持计算机视觉预测。

Method: 创建了多模态、多智能体战术背景下的FOOTPASS数据集，支持开发结合计算机视觉任务输出（如跟踪、识别）和足球战术规律知识的球员中心动作识别方法。

Result: 建立了首个足球比赛全场逐场动作识别的基准数据集，为数据驱动的体育分析提供了重要输入。

Conclusion: FOOTPASS数据集通过整合计算机视觉和战术知识，能够实现更自动化和可靠的逐场数据提取，为体育分析应用奠定基础。

Abstract: Soccer video understanding has motivated the creation of datasets for tasks such as temporal action localization, spatiotemporal action detection (STAD), or multiobject tracking (MOT). The annotation of structured sequences of events (who does what, when, and where) used for soccer analytics requires a holistic approach that integrates both STAD and MOT. However, current action recognition methods remain insufficient for constructing reliable play-by-play data and are typically used to assist rather than fully automate annotation. Parallel research has advanced tactical modeling, trajectory forecasting, and performance analysis, all grounded in game-state and play-by-play data. This motivates leveraging tactical knowledge as a prior to support computer-vision-based predictions, enabling more automated and reliable extraction of play-by-play data. We introduce Footovision Play-by-Play Action Spotting in Soccer Dataset (FOOTPASS), the first benchmark for play-by-play action spotting over entire soccer matches in a multi-modal, multi-agent tactical context. It enables the development of methods for player-centric action spotting that exploit both outputs from computer-vision tasks (e.g., tracking, identification) and prior knowledge of soccer, including its tactical regularities over long time horizons, to generate reliable play-by-play data streams. These streams form an essential input for data-driven sports analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的优化算法缺乏可解释性，无法揭示算法为何有效、哪些组件重要或设计选择与问题结构的关系。

Method: 基于三个支柱：LLM驱动的算法变体发现、可解释基准测试（将性能归因于组件和超参数）、问题类别描述符（连接算法行为与景观结构）。

Result: 形成一个闭环知识循环，其中发现、解释和泛化相互增强。

Conclusion: 这种集成将使领域从盲目搜索转向可解释的、特定类别的算法设计，加速进展的同时产生关于优化策略何时及为何成功的可重用科学见解。

Abstract: Automated algorithm design is entering a new phase: Large Language Models can now generate full optimisation (meta)heuristics, explore vast design spaces and adapt through iterative feedback. Yet this rapid progress is largely performance-driven and opaque. Current LLM-based approaches rarely reveal why a generated algorithm works, which components matter or how design choices relate to underlying problem structures. This paper argues that the next breakthrough will come not from more automation, but from coupling automation with understanding from systematic benchmarking. We outline a vision for explainable automated algorithm design, built on three pillars: (i) LLM-driven discovery of algorithmic variants, (ii) explainable benchmarking that attributes performance to components and hyperparameters and (iii) problem-class descriptors that connect algorithm behaviour to landscape structure. Together, these elements form a closed knowledge loop in which discovery, explanation and generalisation reinforce each other. We argue that this integration will shift the field from blind search to interpretable, class-specific algorithm design, accelerating progress while producing reusable scientific insight into when and why optimisation strategies succeed.

Method: 两阶段训练方法：1) SFT阶段使用87.4万样本的冷启动数据集进行逐步验证；2) RL阶段使用7.4万样本跨多个领域进一步优化和稳定推理能力。

Result: 在9个多模态推理基准上相比Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct基线提升了11.6%，证明了数据质量和训练设计对多模态推理性能的关键作用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large reasoning models have fueled growing interest in extending such capabilities to multimodal domains. However, despite notable progress in visual reasoning, the lack of transparent and reproducible data curation and training strategies remains a major barrier to scalable research. In this work, we introduce OpenMMReasoner, a fully transparent two-stage recipe for multimodal reasoning spanning supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we construct an 874K-sample cold-start dataset with rigorous step-by-step validation, providing a strong foundation for reasoning capabilities. The subsequent RL stage leverages a 74K-sample dataset across diverse domains to further sharpen and stabilize these abilities, resulting in a more robust and efficient learning process. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our training recipe not only surpasses strong baselines but also highlights the critical role of data quality and training design in shaping multimodal reasoning performance. Notably, our method achieves a 11.6% improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct baseline across nine multimodal reasoning benchmarks, establishing a solid empirical foundation for future large-scale multimodal reasoning research. We open-sourced all our codes, pipeline, and data at https://github.com/EvolvingLMMs-Lab/OpenMMReasoner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型难以同时优化多个可能冲突的偏好维度（如事实性、帮助性、安全性），且评分透明度有限。

Method: 将偏好评估分解为领域特定智能体生成部分信号，配合全局评估器，通过中央聚合器融合信号，平衡逐步正确性、多智能体一致性和重复惩罚等因素。

Result: CRM和rewardBench提供了更透明的奖励建模和更稳定优化的实用模块化路径。

Conclusion: 多智能体协作奖励模型框架能够在不增加人工标注的情况下实现多视角奖励塑造，提高奖励模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: We present CRM (Multi-Agent Collaborative Reward Model), a framework that replaces a single black-box reward model with a coordinated team of specialist evaluators to improve robustness and interpretability in RLHF. Conventional reward models struggle to jointly optimize multiple, sometimes conflicting, preference dimensions (e.g., factuality, helpfulness, safety) and offer limited transparency into why a score is assigned. CRM addresses these issues by decomposing preference evaluation into domain-specific agents that each produce partial signals, alongside global evaluators such as ranker-based and embedding-similarity rewards. A centralized aggregator fuses these signals at each timestep, balancing factors like step-wise correctness, multi-agent agreement, and repetition penalties, yielding a single training reward compatible with standard RL pipelines. The policy is optimized with advantage-based updates (e.g., GAE), while a value model regresses to the aggregated reward, enabling multi-perspective reward shaping without requiring additional human annotations beyond those used to train the evaluators. To support training and assessment, we introduce rewardBench, a benchmark and training suite aligned with the collaborative structure of CRM. Together, CRM and rewardBench provide a practical, modular path to more transparent reward modeling and more stable optimization.

Method: TOFA框架包含视觉管道（使用分层贝叶斯模型学习个性化类别原型分布）和文本管道（评估并全局对齐本地文本提示），通过自适应权重校准机制结合双模态预测。

Result: 在9个数据集上的广泛实验表明，TOFA在各种联邦设置下都表现出有效性。

Conclusion: TOFA是一种高效、轻量级的训练免费单次联邦VLM适应方法，能够充分利用预训练VLM的多模态特征，有效处理数据异构性。

Abstract: Efficient and lightweight adaptation of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks through collaborative interactions between local clients and a central server is a rapidly emerging research topic in federated learning. Existing adaptation algorithms are typically trained iteratively, which incur significant communication costs and increase the susceptibility to potential attacks. Motivated by the one-shot federated training techniques that reduce client-server exchanges to a single round, developing a lightweight one-shot federated VLM adaptation method to alleviate these issues is particularly attractive. However, current one-shot approaches face certain challenges in adapting VLMs within federated settings: (1) insufficient exploitation of the rich multimodal information inherent in VLMs; (2) lack of specialized adaptation strategies to systematically handle the severe data heterogeneity; and (3) requiring additional training resource of clients or server. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Training-free One-shot Federated Adaptation framework for VLMs, named TOFA. To fully leverage the generalizable multimodal features in pre-trained VLMs, TOFA employs both visual and textual pipelines to extract task-relevant representations. In the visual pipeline, a hierarchical Bayesian model learns personalized, class-specific prototype distributions. For the textual pipeline, TOFA evaluates and globally aligns the generated local text prompts for robustness. An adaptive weight calibration mechanism is also introduced to combine predictions from both modalities, balancing personalization and robustness to handle data heterogeneity. Our method is training-free, not relying on additional training resources on either the client or server side. Extensive experiments across 9 datasets in various federated settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFA method.

Abstract: Olympiad-level benchmarks in mathematics and physics are crucial testbeds for advanced AI reasoning, but chemistry, with its unique multimodal symbolic language, has remained an open challenge. We introduce ChemO, a new benchmark built from the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) 2025. ChemO features two key innovations for automated assessment: Assessment-Equivalent Reformulation (AER), which converts problems requiring visual outputs (e.g., drawing molecules) into computationally tractable formats, and Structured Visual Enhancement (SVE), a diagnostic mechanism to disentangle a model's visual perception capabilities from its core chemical reasoning. To tackle this benchmark, we propose ChemLabs, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that mimics human expert collaboration through specialized agents for problem decomposition, perception, reasoning, and auditing. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal models demonstrate that combining SVE with our multi-agent system yields dramatic performance gains. Our top configuration achieves a score of 93.6 out of 100, surpassing an estimated human gold medal threshold and establishing a new state-of-the-art in automated chemical problem-solving.

Motivation: 现有GUI代理训练和评估数据集大多是静态和理想化的，无法反映真实环境中复杂性和不可预测性，特别是异常情况的存在。

Method: 提出D-GARA框架，引入多种真实世界异常类型（如权限对话框、电池警告、更新提示等），构建包含常用Android应用和嵌入异常的基准测试集。

Result: 实验显示最先进的GUI代理在异常丰富环境中性能显著下降，表明需要鲁棒性感知学习。

Conclusion: D-GARA是模块化和可扩展的框架，支持新任务、异常类型和交互场景的无缝集成，以满足特定评估目标。

Abstract: Developing intelligent agents capable of operating a wide range of Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) with human-level proficiency is a key milestone on the path toward Artificial General Intelligence. While most existing datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluating GUI agents are static and idealized, failing to reflect the complexity and unpredictability of real-world environments, particularly the presence of anomalies. To bridge this research gap, we propose D-GARA, a dynamic benchmarking framework, to evaluate Android GUI agent robustness in real-world anomalies. D-GARA introduces a diverse set of real-world anomalies that GUI agents commonly face in practice, including interruptions such as permission dialogs, battery warnings, and update prompts. Based on D-GARA framework, we construct and annotate a benchmark featuring commonly used Android applications with embedded anomalies to support broader community research. Comprehensive experiments and results demonstrate substantial performance degradation in state-of-the-art GUI agents when exposed to anomaly-rich environments, highlighting the need for robustness-aware learning. D-GARA is modular and extensible, supporting the seamless integration of new tasks, anomaly types, and interaction scenarios to meet specific evaluation goals.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了真实世界教育内容的大规模利用，为改进面向推理的LLM训练提供了实用的合成数据替代方案

Abstract: The development of Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly depends on high-quality supervised data, yet existing instruction-tuning and RL datasets remain costly to curate and often rely on synthetic samples that introduce hallucination and limited diversity. At the same time, textbooks and exercise materials contain abundant, high-quality human-authored Question-Answer(QA) content that remains underexploited due to the difficulty of transforming raw PDFs into AI-ready supervision. Although modern OCR and vision-language models can accurately parse document structure, their outputs lack the semantic alignment required for training. We propose an automated pipeline that extracts well-formed QA and visual-QA (VQA) pairs from educational documents by combining layout-aware OCR with LLM-based semantic parsing. Experiments across diverse document types show that the method produces accurate, aligned, and low-noise QA/VQA pairs. This approach enables scalable use of real-world educational content and provides a practical alternative to synthetic data generation for improving reasoning-oriented LLM training.

TL;DR: 该论文通过引入物品生命周期作为新的控制维度，重新审视公平感知的交互式推荐系统，提出了LHRL框架来动态协调公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统缺乏对物品生命周期的考虑，而实证分析发现短视频平台的物品生命周期呈现压缩的三阶段模式，与经典四阶段模型显著不同，这为公平性优化提供了新的机会。

Method: 提出了LHRL框架，包含PhaseFormer（结合STL分解和注意力机制的轻量级编码器）进行阶段检测，以及两级分层强化学习代理：高层策略施加阶段感知的公平约束，低层策略优化即时用户参与度。

Result: 在多个真实世界交互推荐数据集上的实验表明，LHRL显著提高了公平性和用户参与度，且将生命周期感知奖励集成到现有RL模型中也能持续获得性能提升。

Conclusion: 生命周期感知的方法能够有效协调长期公平性和短期效用，具有通用性和实用价值。

Abstract: This paper revisits fairness-aware interactive recommendation (e.g., TikTok, KuaiShou) by introducing a novel control knob, i.e., the lifecycle of items. We make threefold contributions. First, we conduct a comprehensive empirical analysis and uncover that item lifecycles in short-video platforms follow a compressed three-phase pattern, i.e., rapid growth, transient stability, and sharp decay, which significantly deviates from the classical four-stage model (introduction, growth, maturity, decline). Second, we introduce LHRL, a lifecycle-aware hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that dynamically harmonizes fairness and accuracy by leveraging phase-specific exposure dynamics. LHRL consists of two key components: (1) PhaseFormer, a lightweight encoder combining STL decomposition and attention mechanisms for robust phase detection; (2) a two-level HRL agent, where the high-level policy imposes phase-aware fairness constraints, and the low-level policy optimizes immediate user engagement. This decoupled optimization allows for effective reconciliation between long-term equity and short-term utility. Third, experiments on multiple real-world interactive recommendation datasets demonstrate that LHRL significantly improves both fairness and user engagement. Furthermore, the integration of lifecycle-aware rewards into existing RL-based models consistently yields performance gains, highlighting the generalizability and practical value of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常针对单一意图设计，无法有效处理包含多个子问题的复杂科学问题，导致证据覆盖不完整。

Method: 使用大语言模型假设潜在答案，将问题分解为意图特定的查询，为每个意图检索支持段落，然后通过互逆排序融合(RRF)聚合和重新排序检索结果。

Result: 在MuISQA基准和其他通用RAG数据集上的实验表明，该方法在检索准确性和证据覆盖方面持续优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 意图感知检索框架能够有效提升多意图科学问题的证据覆盖和检索性能，解决了传统RAG系统的局限性。

Abstract: Complex scientific questions often entail multiple intents, such as identifying gene mutations and linking them to related diseases. These tasks require evidence from diverse sources and multi-hop reasoning, while conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are usually single-intent oriented, leading to incomplete evidence coverage. To assess this limitation, we introduce the Multi-Intent Scientific Question Answering (MuISQA) benchmark, which is designed to evaluate RAG systems on heterogeneous evidence coverage across sub-questions. In addition, we propose an intent-aware retrieval framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to hypothesize potential answers, decompose them into intent-specific queries, and retrieve supporting passages for each underlying intent. The retrieved fragments are then aggregated and re-ranked via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to balance coverage across diverse intents while reducing redundancy. Experiments on both MuISQA benchmark and other general RAG datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms conventional approaches, particularly in retrieval accuracy and evidence coverage.

Motivation: 探索多个组织（诊所、保险公司、专科网络）如何通过假名化案例令牌、本地数据查找和受控操作边界进行安全协作，同时保持数据本地化。

Method: 使用Orpius平台进行多代理编排、工具执行和隐私保护通信。所有代理通过OperationRelay调用交换简洁的自然语言摘要，每个代理操作自己的数据，不接收或重建患者身份。诊所计算基于HMAC的假名令牌，保险公司评估覆盖规则并咨询专科代理，专科代理返回适当性建议。

Result: 成功演示了分布式系统中代理间通信的可行性，展示了架构模式、隐私考量和通信流程，使专业代理能够在保持数据本地化的同时进行分布式推理。

Conclusion: 这项工作突出了在去中心化多代理系统中实现更严格评估和未来研究的机会，强调了在保持数据隐私的同时实现跨组织协作的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a proof-of-concept demonstration of agent-to-agent communication across distributed systems, using only natural-language messages and without shared identifiers, structured schemas, or centralised data exchange. The prototype explores how multiple organisations (represented here as a Clinic, Insurer, and Specialist Network) can cooperate securely via pseudonymised case tokens, local data lookups, and controlled operational boundaries.
  The system uses Orpius as the underlying platform for multi-agent orchestration, tool execution, and privacy-preserving communication. All agents communicate through OperationRelay calls, exchanging concise natural-language summaries. Each agent operates on its own data (such as synthetic clinic records, insurance enrolment tables, and clinical guidance extracts), and none receives or reconstructs patient identity. The Clinic computes an HMAC-based pseudonymous token, the Insurer evaluates coverage rules and consults the Specialist agent, and the Specialist returns an appropriateness recommendation.
  The goal of this prototype is intentionally limited: to demonstrate feasibility, not to provide a clinically validated, production-ready system. No clinician review was conducted, and no evaluation beyond basic functional runs was performed. The work highlights architectural patterns, privacy considerations, and communication flows that enable distributed reasoning among specialised agents while keeping data local to each organisation. We conclude by outlining opportunities for more rigorous evaluation and future research in decentralised multi-agent systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Android恶意软件领域中合成数据质量评估存在挑战，现有度量标准不稳定且缺乏标准化。

Method: 在MalDataGen中集成了Super-Metric，该指标聚合了8个跨4个保真度维度的度量标准，生成单一加权分数。

Result: 实验涉及10个生成模型和5个平衡数据集，表明Super-Metric比传统度量标准更稳定、更一致，与分类器实际性能的相关性更强。

Conclusion: Super-Metric为Android恶意软件合成数据质量评估提供了更稳定和一致的度量方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of synthetic data remains a persistent challenge in the Android malware domain due to instability and the lack of standardization among existing metrics. This work integrates into MalDataGen a Super-Metric that aggregates eight metrics across four fidelity dimensions, producing a single weighted score. Experiments involving ten generative models and five balanced datasets demonstrate that the Super-Metric is more stable and consistent than traditional metrics, exhibiting stronger correlations with the actual performance of classifiers.

*Alexander Zadorojniy,Segev Wasserkrug,Eitan Farchi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于智能体的优化模型自动验证方法，将软件测试技术应用于优化建模领域，通过生成测试API、测试用例和模型变异来验证LLM生成的优化模型是否正确


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着使用LLM从自然语言描述生成优化模型越来越流行，如何验证生成的模型是否正确且满足需求成为一个重要的开放性问题

Method: 基于智能体的验证框架，包含多个智能体：首先生成问题级测试API，然后生成测试用例，最后生成优化模型特定的变异来评估测试套件的故障检测能力

Result: 实验表明该方法在软件测试指标——变异覆盖率方面提供了高质量的验证

Conclusion: 该智能体集成框架能够有效验证LLM生成的优化模型的正确性

Abstract: Recently, using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate optimization models from natural language descriptions has became increasingly popular. However, a major open question is how to validate that the generated models are correct and satisfy the requirements defined in the natural language description. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based method for automatic validation of optimization models that builds upon and extends methods from software testing to address optimization modeling . This method consists of several agents that initially generate a problem-level testing API, then generate tests utilizing this API, and, lastly, generate mutations specific to the optimization model (a well-known software testing technique assessing the fault detection power of the test suite). In this work, we detail this validation framework and show, through experiments, the high quality of validation provided by this agent ensemble in terms of the well-known software testing measure called mutation coverage.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出CorrectHDL框架，利用HLS结果作为功能参考来纠正LLM生成的HDL设计中的潜在错误，在保持功能正确性的同时显著提升面积和功耗效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在硬件前端设计中存在幻觉倾向，常给生成的HDL设计引入功能错误，需要一种方法来纠正这些错误同时保持LLM的生成优势。

Method: 使用C/C++程序作为输入，通过LLM直接生成HDL设计，用RAG机制修复语法错误，通过将模拟行为与HLS参考设计比较来迭代改进功能正确性。

Result: 实验结果显示，该框架生成的电路在面积和功耗效率上显著优于传统HLS设计，接近人工设计质量，同时保持HDL实现的正确性。

Conclusion: CorrectHDL框架有效结合了LLM的生成能力和传统正确性驱动IC设计流程的严谨性，展示了代理式HDL设计的潜力和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in hardware front-end design using hardware description languages (HDLs). However, their inherent tendency toward hallucination often introduces functional errors into the generated HDL designs. To address this issue, we propose the framework CorrectHDL that leverages high-level synthesis (HLS) results as functional references to correct potential errors in LLM-generated HDL designs.The input to the proposed framework is a C/C++ program that specifies the target circuit's functionality. The program is provided to an LLM to directly generate an HDL design, whose syntax errors are repaired using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism. The functional correctness of the LLM-generated circuit is iteratively improved by comparing its simulated behavior with an HLS reference design produced by conventional HLS tools, which ensures the functional correctness of the result but can lead to suboptimal area and power efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that circuits generated by the proposed framework achieve significantly better area and power efficiency than conventional HLS designs and approach the quality of human-engineered circuits. Meanwhile, the correctness of the resulting HDL implementation is maintained, highlighting the effectiveness and potential of agentic HDL design leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of traditional correctness-driven IC design flows.

TL;DR: 论文提出Bauplan，一个为AI代理设计的湖仓架构，通过重新实现数据和计算隔离来解决代理工作流在传统湖仓中的信任问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前企业不信任AI代理处理生产数据，因为传统湖仓不适合代理的访问模式，需要解决基础设施问题来实现可信的代理工作流。

Method: 借鉴数据库MVCC的操作类比，在解耦的多语言环境中重新实现数据和计算隔离，提出代理优先的设计Bauplan。

Result: 开发了Bauplan的参考实现，展示了一个自修复管道，无缝结合了代理推理与正确性和信任所需的保证。

Conclusion: 通过首先解决基础设施问题，设计围绕事务的湖仓架构，可以实现可信的代理工作流，治理问题随之解决。

Abstract: Even as AI capabilities improve, most enterprises do not consider agents trustworthy enough to work on production data. In this paper, we argue that the path to trustworthy agentic workflows begins with solving the infrastructure problem first: traditional lakehouses are not suited for agent access patterns, but if we design one around transactions, governance follows. In particular, we draw an operational analogy to MVCC in databases and show why a direct transplant fails in a decoupled, multi-language setting. We then propose an agent-first design, Bauplan, that reimplements data and compute isolation in the lakehouse. We conclude by sharing a reference implementation of a self-healing pipeline in Bauplan, which seamlessly couples agent reasoning with all the desired guarantees for correctness and trust.

TL;DR: 提出了Pharos-ESG框架，通过多模态解析将ESG报告转换为结构化表示，并发布了首个大规模ESG报告数据集Aurora-ESG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESG报告存在阅读顺序混乱、布局不规则和内容层次不明确的问题，阻碍了大规模理解企业ESG表现。

Method: 采用基于布局流的阅读顺序建模、目录锚点引导的层次感知分割，以及将视觉元素转换为连贯自然语言的多模态聚合管道。

Result: 在标注基准测试中，Pharos-ESG持续优于专用文档解析系统和通用多模态模型。

Conclusion: 该框架为金融治理和决策中的ESG整合提供了更好的支持，通过结构化表示解决了ESG报告的可理解性问题。

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles are reshaping the foundations of global financial gover- nance, transforming capital allocation architectures, regu- latory frameworks, and systemic risk coordination mecha- nisms. However, as the core medium for assessing corpo- rate ESG performance, the ESG reports present significant challenges for large-scale understanding, due to chaotic read- ing order from slide-like irregular layouts and implicit hier- archies arising from lengthy, weakly structured content. To address these challenges, we propose Pharos-ESG, a uni- fied framework that transforms ESG reports into structured representations through multimodal parsing, contextual nar- ration, and hierarchical labeling. It integrates a reading-order modeling module based on layout flow, hierarchy-aware seg- mentation guided by table-of-contents anchors, and a multi- modal aggregation pipeline that contextually transforms vi- sual elements into coherent natural language. The framework further enriches its outputs with ESG, GRI, and sentiment labels, yielding annotations aligned with the analytical de- mands of financial research. Extensive experiments on anno- tated benchmarks demonstrate that Pharos-ESG consistently outperforms both dedicated document parsing systems and general-purpose multimodal models. In addition, we release Aurora-ESG, the first large-scale public dataset of ESG re- ports, spanning Mainland China, Hong Kong, and U.S. mar- kets, featuring unified structured representations of multi- modal content, enriched with fine-grained layout and seman- tic annotations to better support ESG integration in financial governance and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的显著进展基于明确的生成原则，而非模糊算法。这些原则可能在大脑中同样有效，对认知神经科学具有重要意义。

Method: 通过讨论五个具体例子：世界建模的缺陷、思维过程生成、注意力机制、神经缩放定律和量化，来说明机器学习研究对神经科学的潜在贡献。

Result: 机器学习研究提供了一系列关于神经信息处理系统的有趣特征描述，这些特征可能对理解大脑功能有重要启示。

Conclusion: 神经科学可以从机器学习研究中学习很多，特别是生成原则和神经信息处理系统的特征描述方面。

Abstract: The big strides seen in generative AI are not based on somewhat obscure algorithms, but due to clearly defined generative principles. The resulting concrete implementations have proven themselves in large numbers of applications. We suggest that it is imperative to thoroughly investigate which of these generative principles may be operative also in the brain, and hence relevant for cognitive neuroscience. In addition, ML research led to a range of interesting characterizations of neural information processing systems. We discuss five examples, the shortcomings of world modelling, the generation of thought processes, attention, neural scaling laws, and quantization, that illustrate how much neuroscience could potentially learn from ML research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PersonaDrift是一个用于评估机器学习方法检测痴呆症患者日常沟通行为渐进变化的合成基准，模拟了60天的交互日志，重点关注情感扁平化和语义漂移两种变化模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 痴呆症患者(PLwD)的沟通行为会随时间发生渐进变化，但现有计算工具大多无法跟踪这种行为漂移。需要开发能够检测日常沟通中渐进变化的方法。

Method: 基于护理人员访谈创建合成用户模型，模拟60天交互日志。评估了多种异常检测方法：无监督统计方法(CUSUM、EWMA、One-Class SVM)、使用上下文嵌入的序列模型(GRU+BERT)以及监督分类器。

Result: 情感扁平化在基线变异性低的用户中可用简单统计模型检测，而语义漂移检测需要时序建模和个性化基线。个性化分类器在所有任务中都优于通用分类器。

Conclusion: 个性化方法对于检测痴呆症患者沟通行为变化至关重要，个体行为上下文在检测渐进变化中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: People living with dementia (PLwD) often show gradual shifts in how they communicate, becoming less expressive, more repetitive, or drifting off-topic in subtle ways. While caregivers may notice these changes informally, most computational tools are not designed to track such behavioral drift over time. This paper introduces PersonaDrift, a synthetic benchmark designed to evaluate machine learning and statistical methods for detecting progressive changes in daily communication, focusing on user responses to a digital reminder system. PersonaDrift simulates 60-day interaction logs for synthetic users modeled after real PLwD, based on interviews with caregivers. These caregiver-informed personas vary in tone, modality, and communication habits, enabling realistic diversity in behavior. The benchmark focuses on two forms of longitudinal change that caregivers highlighted as particularly salient: flattened sentiment (reduced emotional tone and verbosity) and off-topic replies (semantic drift). These changes are injected progressively at different rates to emulate naturalistic cognitive trajectories, and the framework is designed to be extensible to additional behaviors in future use cases. To explore this novel application space, we evaluate several anomaly detection approaches, unsupervised statistical methods (CUSUM, EWMA, One-Class SVM), sequence models using contextual embeddings (GRU + BERT), and supervised classifiers in both generalized and personalized settings. Preliminary results show that flattened sentiment can often be detected with simple statistical models in users with low baseline variability, while detecting semantic drift requires temporal modeling and personalized baselines. Across both tasks, personalized classifiers consistently outperform generalized ones, highlighting the importance of individual behavioral context.

TL;DR: CLOZE是一个使用大语言模型从临床笔记中自动提取医学实体并整合到层次化医学本体中的零样本框架，无需额外训练或标注数据，同时保护患者隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记作为富含详细患者观察的非结构化文档，为医学本体扩展提供了有价值但未充分利用的资源。直接利用临床笔记进行本体扩展仍是一个未被充分探索的领域。

Method: 利用预训练大语言模型的强大语言理解和广泛生物医学知识，CLOZE框架自动识别疾病相关概念并捕获复杂的层次关系，通过自动化移除受保护健康信息来确保患者隐私。

Result: 实验结果表明CLOZE提供了一个准确、可扩展且保护隐私的本体扩展框架，在生物医学研究和临床信息学中具有广泛的下游应用潜力。

Conclusion: CLOZE框架能够有效利用临床笔记扩展医学本体，为零样本、成本效益高且隐私保护的医学本体扩展提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于澄清数字意识辩论中的概念混淆，为未来讨论提供了更精确的分析基础，而非直接支持或反对任何立场。

Abstract: We develop a taxonomical framework for classifying challenges to the possibility of consciousness in digital artificial intelligence systems. This framework allows us to identify the level of granularity at which a given challenge is intended (the levels we propose correspond to Marr's levels) and to disambiguate its degree of force: is it a challenge to computational functionalism that leaves the possibility of digital consciousness open (degree 1), a practical challenge to digital consciousness that suggests improbability without claiming impossibility (degree 2), or an argument claiming that digital consciousness is strictly impossible (degree 3)? We apply this framework to 14 prominent examples from the scientific and philosophical literature. Our aim is not to take a side in the debate, but to provide structure and a tool for disambiguating between challenges to computational functionalism and challenges to digital consciousness, as well as between different ways of parsing such challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs)的形式化方法，用于改进基于案例推理网络的可解释性，确保解释与预测之间存在充分条件关系，避免误导性解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于案例推理网络虽然天生具有可解释性，但其解释有时会产生误导，特别是在安全关键场景中，多个不同预测的实例可能产生相同的解释。

Method: 结合形式化可解释AI(FXAI)思想，提出了ALE形式化方法，通过在中间表示上表达充分条件来确保解释与预测的关联性，并开发了无需求解器且可扩展的算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的标准图像分类和细粒度图像分类任务中验证了方法的可行性，证明了ALE能够提供更可靠的可解释性保证。

Conclusion: ALE方法成功地将基于案例推理模型的固有可解释性与形式化XAI提供的保证相结合，为安全关键应用提供了更可靠的可解释AI解决方案。

Abstract: Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretable by design". While promising, we show that such explanations are sometimes misleading, which hampers their usefulness in safety-critical contexts. In particular, several instances may lead to different predictions and yet have the same explanation. Drawing inspiration from the field of formal eXplainable AI (FXAI), we propose Abductive Latent Explanations (ALEs), a formalism to express sufficient conditions on the intermediate (latent) representation of the instance that imply the prediction. Our approach combines the inherent interpretability of case-based reasoning models and the guarantees provided by formal XAI. We propose a solver-free and scalable algorithm for generating ALEs based on three distinct paradigms, compare them, and present the feasibility of our approach on diverse datasets for both standard and fine-grained image classification.

TL;DR: YOFO是一种基于模板的多模态大语言模型评判方法，通过单次前向传播同时验证所有结构化需求，实现数量级的速度提升并保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM评判方法面临基本权衡：适应输出单一分数与生成性质不符且限制细粒度需求理解，而自回归生成评判分析在高吞吐场景下速度过慢。

Method: 基于自回归模型，YOFO接受结构化需求模板，在单次推理步骤中通过读取每个需求关联的最终token的logits，为每个需求生成二元是/否决策。

Result: 在标准推荐数据集上实现最先进结果，支持依赖感知分析（后续判断基于先前判断），并可从事后思维链中获益。

Conclusion: YOFO在保持可解释性的同时实现数量级加速，为MLLM评判提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment reduces to verifying whether inputs satisfy a set of structured requirements, we propose YOFO, a template-conditioned method that judges all requirements in a single forward pass. Built on an autoregressive model, YOFO accepts a structured requirement template and, in one inference step, produces a binary yes/no decision for each requirement by reading the logits of the final token associated with that requirement. This design yields orders-of-magnitude speedups while preserving interpretability. Extensive experiments show that YOFO not only achieves state-of-the-art results on standard recommendation datasets, but also supports dependency-aware analysis-where subsequent judgments are conditioned on previous ones-and further benefits from post-hoc CoT.

Result: 训练出的Pelican-VL 1.0模型相比基础模型性能提升20.3%，在100B参数规模上超越开源模型10.6%

Conclusion: DPPO是首个系统性缓解数据和资源瓶颈的框架，使社区能够高效构建多功能具身智能体，相关模型和代码已开源

Abstract: Developing a universal and versatile embodied intelligence system presents two primary challenges: the critical embodied data bottleneck, where real-world data is scarce and expensive, and the algorithmic inefficiency of existing methods, which are resource-prohibitive. To address these limitations, we introduce Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization (DPPO), a metacognitive ``Metaloop'' training framework that dynamically alternates between supervised fine-tuning (competence expansion) and reinforcement learning (skill refinement). This enables automatic weakness identification and targeted resource allocation, specifically designed to maximize learning efficiency from sparse, finite data. Theoretically, DPPO can be formalised as a unified preference-learning framework. Empirically, training a vision-language embodied model with DPPO, referred to as Pelican-VL 1.0, yields a 20.3% performance improvement over the base model and surpasses open-source models at the 100B-parameter scale by 10.6%. We are open-sourcing both the models and code, providing the first systematic framework that alleviates the data and resource bottleneck and enables the community to build versatile embodied agents efficiently.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管transformer模型在临床决策支持中表现出潜力，但它们容易过度自信，特别是在需要校准不确定性的模糊医疗案例中。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：贝叶斯嵌入校准（使用蒙特卡洛dropout）、不确定性加权注意力（对token可靠性进行边缘化）和置信度引导决策塑造（受临床风险最小化启发）。

Result: 在MedQA、PubMedQA、MIMIC-III等基准测试中，MedBayes-Lite将过度自信降低了32-48%，在模拟临床环境中可预防高达41%的诊断错误。

Conclusion: 该框架有效实现了可靠的不确定性传播，提高了医疗AI系统的可解释性，且参数开销低于3%。

Abstract: We propose MedBayes-Lite, a lightweight Bayesian enhancement for transformer-based clinical language models designed to produce reliable, uncertainty-aware predictions. Although transformers show strong potential for clinical decision support, they remain prone to overconfidence, especially in ambiguous medical cases where calibrated uncertainty is critical. MedBayes-Lite embeds uncertainty quantification directly into existing transformer pipelines without any retraining or architectural rewiring, adding no new trainable layers and keeping parameter overhead under 3 percent. The framework integrates three components: (i) Bayesian Embedding Calibration using Monte Carlo dropout for epistemic uncertainty, (ii) Uncertainty-Weighted Attention that marginalizes over token reliability, and (iii) Confidence-Guided Decision Shaping inspired by clinical risk minimization. Across biomedical QA and clinical prediction benchmarks (MedQA, PubMedQA, MIMIC-III), MedBayes-Lite consistently improves calibration and trustworthiness, reducing overconfidence by 32 to 48 percent. In simulated clinical settings, it can prevent up to 41 percent of diagnostic errors by flagging uncertain predictions for human review. These results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling reliable uncertainty propagation and improving interpretability in medical AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of an advanced artificial intelligence-based algorithmic trading system specifically designed for the EUR-USD pair within the high-frequency environment of the Forex market. The methodological approach centers on integrating a holistic set of input features: key fundamental macroeconomic variables (for example, Gross Domestic Product and Unemployment Rate) collected from both the Euro Zone and the United States, alongside a comprehensive suite of technical variables (including indicators, oscillators, Fibonacci levels, and price divergences). The performance of the resulting algorithm is evaluated using standard machine learning metrics to quantify predictive accuracy and backtesting simulations across historical data to assess trading profitability and risk. The study concludes with a comparative analysis to determine which class of input features, fundamental or technical, provides greater and more reliable predictive capacity for generating profitable trading signals.

Abstract: Large language models solve complex problems yet fail on simpler variants, suggesting they achieve correct outputs through mechanisms fundamentally different from human reasoning. We synthesize cognitive science research into a taxonomy of 28 cognitive elements spanning computational constraints, meta-cognitive controls, knowledge representations, and transformation operations, then analyze their behavioral manifestations in reasoning traces. We propose a fine-grained cognitive evaluation framework and conduct the first large-scale analysis of 170K traces from 17 models across text, vision, and audio modalities, alongside 54 human think-aloud traces, which we make publicly available. Our analysis reveals systematic structural differences: humans employ hierarchical nesting and meta-cognitive monitoring while models rely on shallow forward chaining, with divergence most pronounced on ill-structured problems. Meta-analysis of 1,598 LLM reasoning papers reveals the research community concentrates on easily quantifiable behaviors (sequential organization: 55%, decomposition: 60%) while neglecting meta-cognitive controls (self-awareness: 16%, evaluation: 8%) that correlate with success. Models possess behavioral repertoires associated with success but fail to deploy them spontaneously. Leveraging these patterns, we develop test-time reasoning guidance that automatically scaffold successful structures, improving performance by up to 60% on complex problems. By bridging cognitive science and LLM research, we establish a foundation for developing models that reason through principled cognitive mechanisms rather than brittle spurious reasoning shortcuts or memorization, opening new directions for both improving model capabilities and testing theories of human cognition at scale.
