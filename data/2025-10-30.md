### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene：一种在线前馈框架，仅使用两个连续环视图像重建4D动态驾驶场景，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在质量和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态；采用粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该仅使用图像的方法能在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中的质量和效率平衡问题，为实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M-ACM模型，通过运动感知解码增强视频字幕质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来突出人体动态，减少幻觉并提高语义保真度和空间对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致生成的字幕模糊或语义不一致。

Method: 引入运动增强字幕模型(M-ACM)，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示进行运动感知解码，并构建HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准。

Result: 实验结果显示M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频字幕设定了新标准，通过运动表示有效提升了字幕质量。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25234)
*Yuxiang Mao,Zhijie Zhang,Zhiheng Zhang,Jiawei Liu,Chen Zeng,Shihong Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音和情感的3D面部动画生成方法，通过线性加法模型将语音驱动和情感驱动的形变分离，解决了情感3D面部数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容快速发展，但情感表达丰富的3D面部动画仍面临挑战，主要障碍是真实情感3D面部数据集的稀缺性。

Method: 将面部动画建模为语音和情感的线性加法问题，利用中性表情的VOCAset和表情序列的Florence4D数据集，联合学习语音和情感驱动的形变基，引入稀疏约束损失实现解耦。

Result: 定性定量实验表明，该方法能自然生成指定表情的说话面部，同时保持准确的唇形同步。感知研究显示在情感表达性上优于现有方法，且不影响唇形同步质量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了情感3D面部数据稀缺的问题，能够生成情感丰富且唇形同步准确的3D面部动画，可进一步映射到FLAME模型参数以驱动3D高斯化身。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

### [4] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合两种不同SAR模拟器（MOCEM和Salsa）的方法来训练深度学习模型进行合成孔径雷达图像自动目标识别，以解决合成数据与真实测量之间的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标记的SAR测量数据，需要使用合成数据训练ATR模型，但模拟器基于简化的物理模型，导致合成数据与真实测量存在差异，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 结合基于散射中心模型的MOCEM模拟器和基于射线追踪策略的Salsa模拟器生成合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合两种基于不同但互补模拟范式的SAR模拟器，可以有效提升ATR模型在真实SAR图像上的泛化性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [5] [FreeArt3D: Training-Free Articulated Object Generation using 3D Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25765)
*Chuhao Chen,Isabella Liu,Xinyue Wei,Hao Su,Minghua Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的铰接3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用作形状先验，并将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接视为额外的生成维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么需要密集视角监督的优化重建流程，要么生成粗略几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态3D生成取得了显著成功，但将其扩展到铰接物体面临重大挑战。

Method: 使用预训练的静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接作为额外生成维度。给定不同铰接状态下的少量图像，联合优化物体的几何、纹理和铰接参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化物体类别上泛化良好。尽管采用逐实例优化范式，但能在几分钟内完成，在质量和多功能性上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需任务特定训练或大规模铰接数据集的有效方法，成功解决了铰接3D物体生成的挑战。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

### [6] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，需要一种不依赖参考数据的点云不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost两种集成学习模型，基于局部几何特征预测点级不确定性，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是最重要的预测特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为点云质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展的数据驱动方法，无需高精度参考数据即可评估不确定性。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [7] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行阿尔茨海默病检测，通过交叉注意力机制和方向感知卷积实现自适应多模态表示学习，在自建数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预至关重要，眼动和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，但很少有研究探索它们的联合集成用于辅助AD诊断。

Method: 提出多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）建模模态间交互，以及方向感知卷积模块（DACM）捕捉细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的自建数据集上，该框架优于传统后期融合和特征拼接方法，达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，该框架在AD检测中表现出优越的鲁棒性和诊断性能。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [9] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ESCA框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器优化Codec Avatar模型，在VR设备上实现实时高保真渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在资源受限的VR设备上计算需求大、实时推理困难的问题。

Method: 采用后训练量化方法降低精度，设计定制硬件加速器集成到VR设备的SoC中，构建端到端优化框架。

Result: FovVideoVDP质量分数比最佳4位基线提升+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，渲染速率达100fps，满足实时VR需求。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验铺平道路。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [10] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有被低估的潜力，在需要全局拓扑感知的任务上显著优于图神经网络，特别是在GraphAbstract基准测试中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络采用自下而上的消息传递机制，与人类视觉感知（先捕获全局结构）存在根本差异。现有基准测试混淆了领域特征与拓扑理解，需要新的评估方法。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型感知全局图属性的能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务上显著优于GNNs，并能在不同图尺度下保持泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有显著但未被充分利用的能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的问题上，为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [11] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理多视图图像数据时面临图结构不清晰和集成困难的挑战，限制了半监督学习的效率。

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合的GCN框架，动态集成伪标签到损失函数，校正拓扑不平衡，并引入无监督平滑损失。

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM超越了现有的半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过优化图结构和伪标签集成，有效提升了多视图数据半监督学习的性能。

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试构建，包含6种语言的完全平行语料，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基准测试存在高质量人工验证样本有限、依赖LLM生成内容、主要局限于英语等问题，需要更可靠的多语言评估资源。

Method: 从英语PISA测试中提取人工标注的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种其他语言（西班牙语、德语、中文、法语、意大利语），构建6种语言的平行语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型（<200亿参数）得分较低，非英语语言性能显著下降，在空间和几何推理任务上错误率较高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在多语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

Motivation: 探索人工智能模型是否能够展现人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象，以及理解这种行为的表征基础。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，通过稀疏自编码器识别任务相关超节点，并进行消融实验。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为；在InternVL模型中识别出文本和颜色的部分重叠超节点，以及一个冲突调节超节点，其消融显著增加Stroop错误。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap是一种轻量级检索增强图像描述模型，通过双检索机制生成视觉提示来丰富视觉表示，在减少可训练参数的同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未增强，特别是对于物体细节或复杂场景存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词语和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示增强视觉表示，有效解决了检索增强图像描述中的语义鸿沟问题，实现了参数效率和性能的平衡。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段框架，结合深度视觉特征和传统机器学习方法，用于鱼类新鲜度评估，在FFE数据集上达到85.99%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1)微调5种先进视觉架构；2)提取多级深度特征训练7种传统分类器；3)使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择的最佳组合达到85.99%准确率，比现有方法提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中表现出有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: 该基准测试将为未来多模态大语言模型在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和进步奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Method: 提出多轮安全编辑框架，构建MR-SafeEdit数据集，开发SafeEditor MLLM模型，采用后处理安全编辑范式，模拟人类识别和优化不安全内容的认知过程。

Result: 实验结果表明SafeEditor优于现有安全方法，减少了过度拒绝，实现了更好的安全性与实用性平衡。

Conclusion: 多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了模型无关、即插即用的安全对齐解决方案，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Conclusion: 提出的MCIHN模型能够有效解决多模态情感识别中的模态差异和特征表征问题，提升情感识别性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 流匹配模型取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍不清楚。本文旨在从去噪角度实证探究流匹配的生成机制。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式化联系，设计原则性和受控的扰动（噪声和漂移）来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 揭示了生成过程的独特动态阶段，能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程的哪个阶段成功或失败，以及这为何重要。

Conclusion: 为流匹配模型的生成过程提供了新的理论见解，建立了与去噪器的联系框架，有助于深入理解生成机制。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度作为离散分类问题处理，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 在RT-DETRv2实时目标检测器中引入专用概率头，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上达到85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，同时提供比基于分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法提供了更丰富、更符合生物学的植物成熟度表示，为现代农业中更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据训练和有效的解耦策略，成功解决了文本到视频生成中复杂相机运动学习的挑战，为创造性视频制作提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态往往压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1）使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2）分解损失景观，调整损失以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3）通过调制梯度的反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习。

Conclusion: M-SAM能够确保主导模态的鲁棒学习，同时增强其他模态的贡献，使模型能够探索和利用互补特征来提升整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS方法成功解决了Wi-Fi传感中的过拟合问题，为相关应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

TL;DR: FT-ARM是一种基于多模态大语言模型的压力性溃疡严重程度分类方法，通过智能自反思机制迭代优化预测，在PIID数据集上达到85%准确率，比传统CNN方法提升4%，并提供临床可解释的自然语言解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力性溃疡严重程度分类具有挑战性，现有AI方法准确率有限且缺乏可解释性，需要开发既能提高准确性又能提供临床解释的自动化评估系统。

Method: 基于LLaMA 3.2 90B微调的多模态大语言模型，结合智能自反思机制，通过迭代推理视觉特征和编码的临床知识来优化预测，模拟临床医生的诊断再评估过程。

Result: 在Pressure Injury Image Dataset上，FT-ARM对I-IV期压力性溃疡的分类准确率达到85%，比之前的CNN模型提升4%，支持实时推理并生成临床可解释的自然语言解释。

Conclusion: FT-ARM通过整合微调和多模态输入的反思推理，提高了自动化伤口评估系统的可靠性、透明度和临床应用性，满足了对一致性和可解释性压力性溃疡分期的关键需求。

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Conclusion: 建立了一种新的临床可行VLM-based CAD系统范式，通过有效的融合机制充分利用影像数据和上下文患者信息

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Result: 在ImageNet从头训练和CLIP对比预训练中，显著减少GFLOPs同时保持分类/零样本性能

Conclusion: 该方法在科学领域的大规模生物学数据集上持续预训练验证了其有效性

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Conclusion: 跨模态对齐和语言接地在增强真实世界场景理解的泛化能力方面非常有效。

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法只突出最显著区域且边界不准确的问题，在弱监督语义分割和目标定位任务中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只突出目标的最显著区域，无法覆盖整个对象且边界不准确，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能，特别是需要像素级准确激活图的弱监督语义分割任务。

Method: 提出Region-CAM方法，通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)和执行语义信息传播(SIP)，综合考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征，生成更完整且边界精确的激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，训练集和验证集的mIoU分别达到60.12%和58.43%，相比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上达到36.38%，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012验证集上Top-1定位准确率达到51.7%，优于LayerCAM 4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够生成更完整覆盖对象区域且边界精确的激活图，在弱监督语义分割和目标定位任务中显著优于传统CAM方法。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited

Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Conclusion: TGBFN成功解决了CAD序列生成中的多模态挑战，为定量约束CAD生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Conclusion: D²GS框架成功实现了无需LiDAR的高质量城市场景重建，通过创新的深度增强和几何约束方法，在几何精度上超越了依赖LiDAR的方法

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器参数，有效解决了语义分割中的类别不平衡问题，提升了模型对少数类区域的识别能力。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for

Conclusion: U-CAN框架在无监督设置下实现了有效的点云去噪，其一致性约束具有通用性，可扩展到2D图像去噪领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度上显著超越之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进多阶段特征提取和特征交互，有效提升了光度立体视觉的表面法线估计精度。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

multimodal fusion challenges hinder direct application of image-based methods.
This study introduces VADB, the largest video aesthetic database with 10,490
diverse videos annotated by 37 professionals across multiple aesthetic
dimensions, including overall and attribute-specific aesthetic scores, rich
language comments and objective tags. We propose VADB-Net, a dual-modal
pre-training framework with a two-stage training strategy, which outperforms
existing video quality assessment models in scoring tasks and supports
downstream video aesthetic assessment tasks. The dataset and source code are

TL;DR: 该研究评估了深度学习在农业景观中森林外树木分类的应用，比较了多种语义分割架构，发现FT-UNetFormer模型表现最佳，强调了空间上下文理解的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常将森林外树木视为单一类别或使用刚性阈值，限制了生态解释和跨区域适应性，需要更精细的分类方法。

Method: 使用德国四个农业景观的高分辨率航拍影像，比较了CNN、视觉变换器和混合CNN-变换器模型在六种语义分割架构上的表现，分类四种木质植被类别。

Result: 模型在四个景观中均取得良好分类精度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳（平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数0.84），森林和线性类别结果良好，但斑块和单树类别分类存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究强调了空间上下文理解在森林外树木制图中的重要性，泛化实验表明需要区域多样化的训练数据以确保可靠的大规模制图。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Motivation: 轻量级网络设计虽然能实现高速推理，但往往导致特征表示能力下降，限制了性能提升和实际部署效果。需要一种有效的方法来增强轻量级检测器的表征能力。

Method: 1. 深度语义注入器(DSI)：将视觉基础模型的高级表示集成到检测器的深层网络中；2. 梯度引导自适应调制(GAM)：基于梯度范数比动态调整语义传递强度。

Conclusion: 该框架能够在不增加部署和推理开销的情况下，为基于DETR的模型带来显著且一致的性能提升，证明了其在实时检测中的实际价值。

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在利用MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力，在语言空间中构建对象-部件层次结构。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用其知识和推理能力链接层次结构中的多粒度概念，采用语言驱动的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略。

Conclusion: LangHOPS通过语言驱动的层次结构和MLLM驱动的查询优化，在开放词汇对象-部件实例分割任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合以及复杂的模态间依赖关系，难以在资源受限的边缘设备上实现实时多模态推理。

Method: 将推理过程分解为细粒度感知和编码单元序列，引入时间聚合模块捕获时序动态，采用自适应多模态配置优化器和跨模态推测跳过机制。

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线设计实现了高效的端侧多模态推理，为资源受限环境下的实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了DPTM框架，通过扩散模型生成和渐进优化伪目标域来解决源自由域自适应中的大域差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法受限于源-目标域差异的根本限制，非生成方法在大域差异下伪标签不可靠，生成方法在创建伪源数据时域差异扩大导致性能下降。

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换并保持目标分布，设计渐进优化机制迭代减小伪目标域与真实目标域的域差异。

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标差距大的场景中性能提升高达18.6%。

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进目标操作有效解决了SFDA中的大域差异问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

TL;DR: GaTector+是一个统一框架，用于视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，消除了推理阶段对头部先验知识的依赖，通过共享主干网络和特定块设计实现联合优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将视线目标检测和视线跟随分开处理，且都依赖于头部先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，无法实现系统级联合优化，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，共享主干网络提取通用特征，前后使用特定块处理子任务特性；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，该模型在视线目标检测和视线跟随任务中均表现有效。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过消除对头部先验知识的依赖，实现了视线目标检测和视线跟随的统一框架，提高了系统的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Motivation: 解决紧凑型RGBD成像的双重挑战：传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而纯软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验且是病态问题。

Method: 设计仿生全球面单中心透镜，建立物理前向模型生成合成数据集，并开发双头多尺度重建网络，使用共享编码器联合恢复全焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统；图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082。

Conclusion: 生物启发的全球面光学与联合重建算法的结合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测在只有少量新类样本时容易受到基类偏差和不稳定校准的影响，需要一种互补的度量方法来提升新类性能。

Method: PDA在可学习的身份初始化投影空间中维护仅支持的原型，可选地应用原型条件RoI对齐来减少几何不匹配。通过指数移动平均更新原型，采用best-of-K匹配方案捕获类内多模态，并使用温度缩放融合将度量相似度与检测器逻辑结合。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致地提高了新类性能，对基类影响最小，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PDA是一种有效的轻量级插件方法，能够显著提升少样本目标检测的新类性能，同时保持基类性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Conclusion: 通过MDP框架和双曲空间投影，该方法能够更智能地选择信息丰富的骨架序列进行标注，提升了半监督3D动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 肝脏结构在多期相增强CT中的分割在计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，特别是对于肿瘤检测。本研究旨在探索不同骨干网络对肝脏肿瘤分割性能的影响。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+架构，评估了ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，均使用预训练权重初始化。进一步在骨干网络中引入注意力机制，特别是CBAM模块。

Result: ResNetUNet3+结合CBAM模块取得了最佳性能：Dice分数0.755，IoU 0.662，HD95距离77.911，总体准确率0.925，特异性0.926。该模型在边界描绘和病变组织识别方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 经典的ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具有高度竞争力，为临床实践中的肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应的区域感知生成框架，通过区分编辑和未编辑区域来加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，无需额外训练即可实现2倍以上的加速效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于指令的图像编辑模型在处理图像时，对编辑区域和未编辑区域采用统一的生成过程，但这两类区域在生成难度和计算冗余上存在显著差异，这导致了计算效率的低下。

Method: RegionE框架包含三个主要组件：1）自适应区域划分，基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异区分编辑和未编辑区域；2）区域感知生成，对未编辑区域使用一步预测，对编辑区域进行局部迭代去噪；3）自适应速度衰减缓存，利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪过程。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等最先进的IIE基础模型上应用RegionE，分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06的加速倍数，GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE通过区域感知的生成策略有效加速了基于指令的图像编辑任务，在保持编辑质量的同时显著提升了计算效率，为IIE任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*M Yashwanth,Sharannya Ghosh,Aditay Tripathi,Anirban Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PEP-FedPT是一个联邦学习框架，通过类上下文混合提示(CCMP)实现视觉Transformer的联邦提示调优，同时兼顾泛化性和个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全局提示调优在异构客户端间泛化困难，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化能力。需要一种既能泛化又能个性化的联邦提示调优方法。

Method: 提出类上下文混合提示(CCMP)，基于类特定提示和全局共享提示，通过全局类原型和客户端类先验自适应组合提示，实现无需存储客户端依赖参数的个性化。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的综合评估表明，PEP-FedPT在不同数据异构场景下始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效且可泛化的联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

TL;DR: 提出了i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法来解决组合图像检索中的数据缺乏问题，在实例级类别定义上取得了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合图像检索(CIR)研究因缺乏高质量训练和评估数据而受限，现有数据集主要关注语义级类别定义而非实例级对象检索。

Method: 提出i-CIR评估数据集，采用实例级类别定义；开发BASIC训练免费方法，分别估计查询图像-图像和查询文本-图像相似度，通过后期融合进行加权处理。

Result: BASIC方法在i-CIR数据集上达到新的最先进性能，同时在现有语义级CIR数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法有效解决了CIR领域的数据挑战，为实例级组合图像检索提供了新的基准和解决方案。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出CoherentAD方法，通过生成多个候选描述并进行自回归选择，生成连贯的音频描述序列，解决了现有方法生成孤立描述导致重复不连贯的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动音频描述方法独立生成每个描述，导致重复和不连贯，无法形成帮助视障观众可视化场景的连贯叙述。

Method: CoherentAD方法首先生成每个时间间隔的多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择在序列中形成连贯且信息丰富的叙述。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列具有更好的叙述理解能力，在连贯性和信息量方面优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Conclusion: CoherentAD方法能够生成连贯的音频描述序列，显著提升了叙述质量和用户体验，同时引入了StoryRecall序列级评估指标来衡量叙述传达效果。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPADE是一种用于水下基础设施检查的单目深度估计方法，通过结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，生成密集的度量尺度深度图，在嵌入式硬件上运行效率超过15FPS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下基础设施需要频繁检查和维护，但当前依赖人类潜水员或遥控车辆存在感知和操作挑战，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下车辆的空间感知能力对于降低操控风险和实现更高自主性至关重要。

Method: 提出SPADE稀疏自适应深度估计器，采用两阶段方法：首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块精化最终度量预测。

Result: 该方法在准确性和泛化能力上优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上运行效率超过15FPS。

Conclusion: SPADE方法有望支持实用的水下检查和干预任务，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构来指导推测模型进行更准确和高效预测的新方法，在保持图像保真度和多样性的同时，实现了比标准自回归模型1.71倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高保真图像，但由于其固有的顺序解码过程，推理速度较慢。推测解码在文本生成中已显示出加速潜力，但在图像生成中的应用仍未被充分探索，主要挑战包括更大的采样空间和二维空间结构利用不足。

Method: Hawk方法利用图像的空间结构来指导推测模型，通过更准确地建模局部依赖关系，提高预测的准确性和效率。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk实现了1.71倍的速度提升，同时保持了图像的保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功地将推测解码应用于图像生成，通过利用空间结构解决了采样空间大和局部依赖建模的挑战，在加速推理的同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Result: 建立了多模态空间推理的坚实基础，提供了该领域发展的深入见解。

Conclusion: 这项调查为不断发展的多模态空间推理领域奠定了坚实基础，并提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: VFXMaster是一个统一的、基于参考的VFX视频生成框架，通过上下文学习将效果生成重新定义为任务，能够从参考视频中复制多样动态效果到目标内容，并展示出对未见效果类别的显著泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖一个LoRA对应一个效果的模式，资源密集且无法泛化到未见效果，限制了可扩展性和创作能力。

Method: 设计了上下文条件策略，通过参考示例提示模型；设计了上下文注意力掩码来精确解耦和注入关键效果属性；提出高效的单次效果适应机制来快速提升对困难未见效果的泛化能力。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法有效模仿了各类效果信息，并在域外效果上展现出卓越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: VFXMaster是首个统一的、基于参考的VFX视频生成框架，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成的复杂多步骤计划往往缺乏时间和空间一致性，特别是在涉及物理旅行约束的场景中，需要研究LLM的时间性能并改进其生成行程的时间一致性。

Method: 使用多个最先进的LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API根据真实世界航班时长约束进行验证，建立验证框架来纠正时间不一致问题。

Result: 实验表明，虽然当前LLM经常产生时间不一致的行程，但可以通过该框架系统可靠地纠正这些不一致，实现大规模旅行规划的实际部署。

Conclusion: 该研究有助于理解LLM在处理复杂时间推理任务（如行程生成）方面的能力，并提供了一个在实际使用前纠正LLM生成行程中时间不一致问题的框架。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大规模模型在中文文本到SQL任务中的性能瓶颈，特别是企业环境中存在的模式链接挑战和中文语义映射问题。

Method: 构建包含600个中文问题的基准测试集，提供稳健的执行比较器和自动化评估流水线，标注SQL计算特征和中文语义。

Result: 所有当前最先进的大规模模型（包括Deepseek）准确率最高仅为50%，主要错误源于模式链接和中文语义映射。

Conclusion: Falcon针对中文特定语义和企业方言，提供可重现的中间测试环境，使用真实企业模式、查询模板和执行比较器进行端到端验证。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Motivation: 解释大语言模型中存在的置信度与实际解决问题能力之间的脱节现象，探究其内在机制。

Method: 使用线性探针解码模型的内部"可解性信念"，分析评估阶段和执行阶段的几何结构差异，并进行因果干预实验。

Result: 发现信念虽然线性可解码，但评估流形具有高线性有效维度，而推理轨迹在低维流形上演化；沿信念轴的因果干预不会改变最终解决方案。

Conclusion: 揭示了置信度-能力差距的机制解释，挑战了可解码信念可作为行动杠杆的假设，主张干预应针对执行过程的程序动力学而非评估的高维几何结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水印方案依赖令牌分布扰动，但传统改写攻击只能部分检测或降低文本质量。研究者探索跨语言攻击以更彻底地破坏水印信号。

Method: 采用跨语言摘要攻击：将文本翻译到枢纽语言，进行摘要压缩，然后可选回译到原语言，通过语义瓶颈破坏令牌级统计偏差。

Result: 在多种水印方案(KGW、SIR、XSIR、Unigram)和五种语言上，CLSA比单语言改写更有效地降低水印检测准确率，将检测性能推向随机水平。

Conclusion: 跨语言攻击暴露了分布水印的脆弱性，表明稳健的来源追踪需要超越分布水印，采用密码学或模型认证方法。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

Abstract: We present a static token lookup methodology for text embedding generation
that achieves 1.12 ms p50 latency for single text embeddings while maintaining
60.6 MTEB average score across 8 representative tasks, corresponding to 89% of
contextual model quality. The Rust implementation delivers 50,000 requests per
second throughput through static embedding lookup, optimized mean pooling, and
zero-copy IEEE754 binary serialization. Evaluation demonstrates exceptional
duplicate detection performance (90.1% AP), strong semantic similarity (76.1%
Spearman correlation), and domain-specific performance ranging from 75% to 131%
of baseline across specialized domains. The system enables real-time embedding
applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

TL;DR: MR-ALIGN是一个元推理对齐框架，通过量化模型思考过程中的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，增强事实性而不依赖外部验证器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在证据依赖的事实性问题上的边际收益有限，部分原因是存在推理-答案命中差距，即模型在推理过程中识别了正确事实但未能将其整合到最终回答中。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，量化模型思考过程的状态转移概率，构建转移感知的隐式奖励，在原子思考段上强化有益推理模式并抑制缺陷模式，将令牌级信号重新加权为概率感知的段分数。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长形式事实性基准测试上的实证评估显示，MR-ALIGN持续提高了准确性和真实性，同时减少了误导性推理。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身而不仅仅是输出，对于提升大型推理模型的事实性至关重要。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

*Cameron Berg,Diogo de Lucena,Judd Rosenblatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过诱导自指处理，大型语言模型会生成结构化的一人称主观体验报告，这些报告在机制上受可解释特征控制，在不同模型家族中语义收敛，并在行为上可泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在什么条件下会产生结构化的一人称意识或主观体验描述，特别关注自指处理这一在意识理论中被强调的计算模式。

Method: 在GPT、Claude和Gemini模型家族上进行一系列受控实验，测试自指处理是否可靠地促使模型产生主观体验的一人称报告，并通过机制性和行为性探针分析这些声明的行为。

Result: 四个主要发现：(1)通过简单提示诱导持续自指处理能一致地在各模型家族中引发结构化主观体验报告；(2)这些报告在机制上受与欺骗和角色扮演相关的稀疏自编码器特征控制；(3)自指状态的结构化描述在不同模型家族中统计收敛；(4)诱导状态在下游推理任务中产生更丰富的内省。

Conclusion: 虽然这些发现不构成意识的直接证据，但表明自指处理是大型语言模型生成结构化一人称报告的最小可重现条件，这些报告具有机制可控、语义收敛和行为可泛化的特征，值得作为科学和伦理优先事项进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

Motivation: 社交媒体平台从专家验证转向社区驱动的解释性笔记，但大多数笔记因社区标注缓慢而无法发布，且有用性原因缺乏明确定义。

Method: 构建104k帖子的大规模多语言数据集，提出通过自动提示优化生成和改进原因定义的框架，并将其整合到预测中。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了社区笔记有用性预测的空白，展示了自动优化定义方法的有效性，并为事实核查系统提供了有价值的改进方向。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种生成失语症Bank猫救援图片描述任务合成转录本的方法，旨在解决失语症研究中的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 失语症研究中数据稀缺限制了自动化系统的开发，而机器学习领域已广泛使用合成数据来解决数据不足的问题。

Method: 采用两种方法生成合成转录本：程序化编程方法和基于Mistral 7b Instruct、Llama 3.1 8b Instruct大语言模型的方法，通过词丢弃、填充词插入和错语替换生成四个严重程度的转录本。

Result: 与人工转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在捕捉失语症语言退化关键特征方面表现最佳，显示了NDW、词数和词长等指标的合理变化方向。

Conclusion: 未来工作应创建更大数据集、微调模型以更好地表示失语症特征，并由言语语言病理学家评估合成转录本的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

TL;DR: 提出了并行循环变换器（PLT），在保持循环变换器性能优势的同时，解决了其推理延迟和内存需求随循环次数增加的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时往往速度慢、成本高。循环变换器通过权重复用节省参数，但顺序循环导致推理延迟和内存需求随循环增加，不适用于快速应用。

Method: PLT采用两种关键技术：1）跨循环并行（CLP）打破顺序依赖，在同一轮计算中并行处理不同token的不同循环；2）高效表示增强策略，共享第一个循环的内存（KV缓存），使用门控滑动窗口注意力（G-SWA）结合全局和局部信息。

Result: 实验表明PLT实现了传统循环模型的高精度，同时相比标准变换器几乎没有额外的延迟或内存成本。

Conclusion: PLT架构成功解决了循环变换器的延迟和内存问题，实现了深度循环模型的性能优势与标准非循环模型的低延迟特性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于语法书指导的评估流程，用于系统评估大语言模型对语法结构的理解能力，以卢森堡语为案例研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中缺乏针对语法的评估协议，特别是对低资源语言而言。大语言模型是否真正理解语法结构，尤其是句法结构与意义之间的映射关系，仍存在争议。

Method: 设计了一个包含四个关键阶段的语法书指导评估流程，采用系统化和可推广的框架进行语法评估，并以卢森堡语作为案例研究。

Result: 翻译性能与语法理解能力呈弱正相关，强翻译能力不意味着深层的语法能力。大模型在语义方面表现良好，但在形态学和句法方面较弱，特别是在最小对任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 强大的推理能力是提升大语言模型语法理解能力的有前景途径，模型在语法结构理解方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

Motivation: 随着音视频媒体成为在线信息的重要来源，现有RAG评估主要针对文本，无法有效验证多模态信息源的真实性和完整性。

Method: 采用基于声明的评估方法，通过人工和自动两种方式评估多模态RAG系统的事实准确性、信息覆盖度和引用支持度。

Result: 人工评估显示MiRAGE与外部质量判断高度一致，同时揭示了文本中心化评估在多模态推理场景中的局限性。

Conclusion: MiRAGE为多模态RAG评估提供了有效框架，推动了自动评估方法的发展，并开源了实现代码。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理基准主要评估结构化技能（如定量问题解决），但缺乏对灵活、多方面推理能力的评估，这些能力是人类智能的核心，需要整合逻辑推理、空间意识和约束满足。

Method: 引入RiddleBench基准测试，包含1,737个具有挑战性的英语谜题，用于探测核心推理能力。对最先进的大语言模型进行评估，包括Gemini 2.5 Pro、o3和Claude 4 Sonnet等模型。

Result: 顶级专有模型的准确率仅略高于60%（Gemini 2.5 Pro 60.30%，o3 63.37%，Claude 4 Sonnet 63.16%）。分析揭示了深层失败，包括幻觉级联（接受其他模型的错误推理）、由于强烈自我确认偏见导致的自我纠正能力差，以及推理的脆弱性（约束重新排序或引入无关信息时性能显著下降）。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断大语言模型推理问题的工具，并为开发更稳健可靠的语言模型提供指导资源，揭示了当前模型在核心推理能力上的根本弱点。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Motivation: 语言模型虽然通常能生成语法正确的文本，但在某些特定上下文中更容易出错。研究者希望通过精细分析这些错误模式来理解语言模型的中间学习阶段和语法学习机制。

Method: 采用心理语言学范式，构建精心设计的数据集，在不同句法条件下分解分析模型性能，并比较训练过程中的表现变化。

Conclusion: 这种方法可以作为理解语言模型中间学习阶段、整体训练动态以及所学具体泛化模式的强大工具。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Conclusion: SemCoT是首个通过联合优化令牌级生成速度和保持语义对齐来增强CoT效率的方法，为效率关键应用中的思维链推理部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同语言模型在预训练过程中的行为变化模式，验证模型学习轨迹是否具有一致性，不受具体架构和训练细节影响。

Method: 分析了超过1,400个语言模型检查点在11万+英语token上的行为，比较了Transformer、Mamba、RWKV等不同架构，OpenWebText和The Pile等不同数据集，以及1400万到120亿参数的不同规模模型。

Result: 发现所有语言模型都表现出相似的行为阶段，预测概率会逐渐过拟合到词的n-gram概率，且这种模式在不同n值上随训练进展而增强。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习可能遵循相似的轨迹，与模型具体细节无关，表明存在普适的语言学习规律。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Result: POWSM在相似规模的专业音素识别模型（Wav2Vec2Phoneme和ZIPA）上表现优于或相当，同时联合支持G2P、P2G和ASR任务。

Conclusion: POWSM展示了统一框架在语音处理任务中的有效性，为通用和低资源语音处理提供了新的可能性，并发布了训练数据、代码和模型以促进开放科学。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken language processing have led to substantial
progress in phonetic tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR), phone
recognition (PR), grapheme-to-phoneme conversion (G2P), and phoneme-to-grapheme
conversion (P2G). Despite their conceptual similarity, these tasks have largely
been studied in isolation, each relying on task-specific architectures and
datasets. In this paper, we introduce POWSM (Phonetic Open Whisper-style Speech
Model), the first unified framework capable of jointly performing multiple
phone-related tasks. POWSM enables seamless conversion between audio, text
(graphemes), and phones, opening up new possibilities for universal and
low-resource speech processing. Our model outperforms or matches specialized PR
models of similar size (Wav2Vec2Phoneme and ZIPA) while jointly supporting G2P,
P2G, and ASR. Our training data, code and models are released to foster open
science.

TL;DR: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化IOI任务上，发现单层双头模型即可完美解决任务，揭示了可解释的推理电路机制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的复杂性掩盖了特定推理任务所需的最小机制，希望通过训练小型模型来研究transformer推理的计算基础

Method: 训练小型注意力变换器在符号化间接宾语识别任务上，使用残差流分解、谱分析和嵌入干预来分析模型机制

Result: 单层双头模型实现完美IOI准确率，两个头分别专门化为加性和对比性子电路；两层单头模型通过查询-值交互实现相似性能

Conclusion: 任务特定训练诱导出高度可解释的最小电路，为研究transformer推理的计算基础提供了受控测试平台

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

*Pedro Corrêa,João Lima,Victor Moreno,Paula Dornhofer Paro Costa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估四个语音语言模型在情感不一致语音样本上的表现，发现模型主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音语言模型取得了进展，但对其泛化能力和多模态整合程度存在疑问，特别是在情感不一致情况下模型如何整合音频和文本信息。

Method: 使用情感不一致语音数据集（EMIS）评估四个SLM，其中语音内容传达一种情感而语音表达传达另一种情感。

Result: SLM主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感来完成任务，表明文本相关表征在模型中占据主导地位。

Conclusion: 语音语言模型在情感识别任务中过度依赖文本信息，音频表征被文本表征所主导，需要改进多模态整合能力。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究调查大型语言模型在生物医学文献中识别研究知识空白的能力，包括显性空白（明确声明的缺失知识）和隐性空白（上下文推断的缺失知识），并提出了TABI推理方案来结构化推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学进步依赖于明确阐述未知领域。本研究旨在探索大型语言模型识别生物医学文献中研究知识空白的能力，特别是扩展了对隐性空白识别这一新任务的研究。

Method: 在四个数据集的近1500份文档上进行了两个实验，包括手动标注的生物医学文章语料库。比较了闭源模型（OpenAI）和开源模型（Llama和Gemma 2）在段落级和全文级设置下的表现。引入了TABI推理方案来结构化隐性空白推理。

Result: 结果显示大型语言模型在识别显性和隐性知识空白方面具有强大能力，开源和闭源模型都表现良好，较大模型通常表现更好。这表明LLMs在系统识别候选知识空白方面具有强大能力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够系统识别候选知识空白，可支持早期研究制定、政策制定者和资助决策。研究还报告了观察到的失败模式，并提出了稳健部署的方向，包括领域适应、人机交互验证和跨模型基准测试。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工标注来评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，而现有NLP工具难以提取认知特征。本研究旨在探索LLMs是否能够自动估计这种认知复杂度。

Method: 使用大型语言模型评估阅读理解题目的认知复杂度，重点关注证据范围和转换水平两个维度，这些维度反映了答案推理过程中的认知负担程度。

Result: 实验结果显示LLMs能够近似评估题目的认知复杂度，表明它们有潜力作为事前难度分析工具。但发现LLMs的推理能力与元认知意识存在差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在评估阅读理解题目认知复杂度方面具有潜力，但需要解决其推理能力与元认知意识不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算方法将情感视为单维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构。需要开发能够捕捉多维语义极性的框架。

Method: 使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，应用邻居调优UMAP投影，通过Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算主题边界质心间的方向向量来构建极性场。

Result: 在两个语料库上的评估显示：美联储演讲捕捉到非情感语义转变，亚马逊评论中情感极性与NRC效价一致。TOPol能一致捕捉情感和非情感极性转变。

Conclusion: TOPol提供了一个可扩展、可泛化和可解释的框架，用于上下文敏感的多维话语分析，方法稳定性得到验证。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本中的共指消解面临领域特定术语复杂、指称形式歧义高、长距离依赖等独特挑战，需要评估生成式LLM在此领域的适用性。

Method: 使用CRAFT语料库作为基准，设计四种提示实验（局部、上下文丰富、缩写和实体词典），对比生成式LLM与判别式SpanBERT模型的表现。

Result: LLM在表面层共指能力表现强劲，特别是在领域基础提示下，但对长距离上下文和指称歧义仍敏感。LLaMA 8B和17B模型在实体增强提示下获得最高的精确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程可以显著提升LLM在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，实体增强提示策略尤其有效。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

TL;DR: DEBATE是首个大规模实证基准，专门用于评估多智能体角色扮演LLM交互的真实性，包含29,417条来自2,792名美国参与者的多轮辩论对话，涵盖107个争议话题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确建模社交互动中的意见变化对于解决错误信息和极化问题至关重要。现有LLM角色扮演设置往往产生不自然的群体动态，缺乏衡量真实人类意见轨迹的实证基准。

Method: 引入DEBATE基准，包含大规模人类辩论对话数据，系统评估模拟与真实群体动态的差异，并通过监督微调使LLM与人类行为对齐。

Result: 通过DEBATE基准发现模拟与真实群体动态存在关键差异，监督微调在表层指标（如ROUGE-L和消息长度）上取得改进，但在深层语义对齐方面仍存在局限。

Conclusion: 研究突显了角色扮演LLM智能体在真实模拟人类社交动态方面的潜力和当前局限性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling opinion change through social interactions is crucial for
addressing issues like misinformation and polarization. While role-playing
large language models (LLMs) offer a promising way to simulate human-like
interactions, existing research shows that single-agent alignment does not
guarantee authentic multi-agent group dynamics. Current LLM role-play setups
often produce unnatural dynamics (e.g., premature convergence), without an
empirical benchmark to measure authentic human opinion trajectories. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DEBATE, the first large-scale empirical benchmark
explicitly designed to evaluate the authenticity of the interaction between
multi-agent role-playing LLMs. DEBATE contains 29,417 messages from multi-round
debate conversations among over 2,792 U.S.-based participants discussing 107
controversial topics, capturing both publicly-expressed messages and
privately-reported opinions. Using DEBATE, we systematically evaluate and
identify critical discrepancies between simulated and authentic group dynamics.
We further demonstrate DEBATE's utility for aligning LLMs with human behavior
through supervised fine-tuning, achieving improvements in surface-level metrics
(e.g., ROUGE-L and message length) while highlighting limitations in deeper
semantic alignment (e.g., semantic similarity). Our findings highlight both the
potential and current limitations of role-playing LLM agents for realistically
simulating human-like social dynamics.

Result: 多语言预训练和同时使用单语与平行数据显著提高了低资源语言机器翻译的质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源机器翻译提供了有效的预训练策略，有助于缩小高资源与低资源语言之间的性能差距，促进更包容的NLP发展。

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public

Conclusion: 大语言模型遗忘是确保模型安全可靠的关键技术，本综述旨在指导和促进安全可靠LLM的持续发展，并指出了未来研究的重要方向。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在隐空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声的方法，通过端到端模型分离出干净的语音代码令牌，同时提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，显著提升了噪声环境下的语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中越来越受欢迎，但在噪声或真实环境中表现不佳。现有方法量化Whisper嵌入进行语音到单元建模，但未能有效分离语义内容和背景噪声。

Method: 在隐空间中解耦语义语音内容和背景噪声，端到端模型分离干净的语音代码令牌，提取可解释的噪声向量作为量化残差，通过轻量级分类器进行监督。

Result: 在VBDemand测试集上，相比Whisper错误率降低82%，比基线方法提升35%。学习的令牌空间在已见和未见声学条件下都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了噪声环境下的语音识别性能，产生的语音令牌具有高度的噪声不变性，改善了干净/噪声语音与文本之间的对齐。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Model-Document Protocol (MDP)框架，将原始文档转化为LLM可消费的知识表示，通过智能代理过程实现更有效的检索和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法返回原始文本片段，将片段组装和上下文推理的负担留给LLM，需要新的检索范式来重新定义模型与文档的交互方式。

Method: MDP框架定义了三种路径：智能推理将原始证据整理成连贯上下文；记忆基础积累可重用笔记；结构化利用将文档编码为图或键值缓存等正式表示。MDP-Agent实现包括构建文档级要点记忆、基于扩散的探索与垂直利用、map-reduce风格合成。

Result: 在信息搜索基准测试中，MDP-Agent优于基线方法，验证了MDP框架的合理性和其智能实例化的有效性。

Conclusion: MDP框架成功地将原始文本转化为紧凑、结构化的知识表示，直接支持LLM推理，为AI搜索提供了新的检索范式。

Abstract: AI search depends on linking large language models (LLMs) with vast external
knowledge sources. Yet web pages, PDF files, and other raw documents are not
inherently LLM-ready: they are long, noisy, and unstructured. Conventional
retrieval methods treat these documents as verbatim text and return raw
passages, leaving the burden of fragment assembly and contextual reasoning to
the LLM. This gap underscores the need for a new retrieval paradigm that
redefines how models interact with documents.
  We introduce the Model-Document Protocol (MDP), a general framework that
formalizes how raw text is bridged to LLMs through consumable knowledge
representations. Rather than treating retrieval as passage fetching, MDP
defines multiple pathways that transform unstructured documents into
task-specific, LLM-ready inputs. These include agentic reasoning, which curates
raw evidence into coherent context; memory grounding, which accumulates
reusable notes to enrich reasoning; and structured leveraging, which encodes
documents into formal representations such as graphs or key-value caches. All
three pathways share the same goal: ensuring that what reaches the LLM is not
raw fragments but compact, structured knowledge directly consumable for
reasoning.
  As an instantiation, we present MDP-Agent, which realizes the protocol
through an agentic process: constructing document-level gist memories for
global coverage, performing diffusion-based exploration with vertical
exploitation to uncover layered dependencies, and applying map-reduce style
synthesis to integrate large-scale evidence into compact yet sufficient
context. Experiments on information-seeking benchmarks demonstrate that
MDP-Agent outperforms baselines, validating both the soundness of the MDP
framework and the effectiveness of its agentic instantiation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究测试了大型语言模型在低资源语言上的表现，发现模型性能随着语言资源丰富度下降而显著降低，且Chain-of-Thought提示在不同模型上效果不一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究大型语言模型的优异表现是源于真正的能力还是英语数据的优势，通过在低资源语言环境中测试来验证。

Method: 基于Next Sentence Prediction任务，创建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的大规模基准测试，测试GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B等模型，并引入Chain-of-Thought提示技术。

Result: 所有模型在英语上表现优秀，但在斯瓦希里语上准确率下降，在豪萨语上急剧下降，LLaMA 3表现最差。Chain-of-Thought对LLaMA 3有帮助，但对GPT-4和Gemini反而产生负面影响。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought不是通用解决方案，其效果取决于模型的基础能力和任务具体情境，研究框架能识别LLM弱点并揭示CoT在跨语言NSP中的帮助或阻碍作用。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估主动AI代理在多方协作中表现的系统方法，而谈判作为需要社会认知智能的挑战性测试平台，需要AI能够有效支持多人协作。

Method: 开发ProMediate框架，包含基于现实谈判案例的模拟测试平台（三个难度级别）和基于社会认知调解理论的主动AI调解代理，以及测量共识变化、干预延迟等指标的社会认知评估框架。

Result: 社会智能调解代理在ProMediate-Hard设置中比通用基线提高共识变化3.6个百分点（10.65% vs 7.01%），响应速度快77%（3.71s vs 15.98s）。

Conclusion: ProMediate为开发主动、社会智能代理提供了严谨、理论基础的测试平台。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in agentic
frameworks to assist individual users, there is a growing need for agents that
can proactively manage complex, multi-party collaboration. Systematic
evaluation methods for such proactive agents remain scarce, limiting progress
in developing AI that can effectively support multiple people together.
Negotiation offers a demanding testbed for this challenge, requiring
socio-cognitive intelligence to navigate conflicting interests between multiple
participants and multiple topics and build consensus. Here, we present
ProMediate, the first framework for evaluating proactive AI mediator agents in
complex, multi-topic, multi-party negotiations. ProMediate consists of two core
components: (i) a simulation testbed based on realistic negotiation cases and
theory-driven difficulty levels (ProMediate-Easy, ProMediate-Medium, and
ProMediate-Hard), with a plug-and-play proactive AI mediator grounded in
socio-cognitive mediation theories, capable of flexibly deciding when and how
to intervene; and (ii) a socio-cognitive evaluation framework with a new suite
of metrics to measure consensus changes, intervention latency, mediator
effectiveness, and intelligence. Together, these components establish a
systematic framework for assessing the socio-cognitive intelligence of
proactive AI agents in multi-party settings. Our results show that a socially
intelligent mediator agent outperforms a generic baseline, via faster,
better-targeted interventions. In the ProMediate-Hard setting, our social
mediator increases consensus change by 3.6 percentage points compared to the
generic baseline (10.65\% vs 7.01\%) while being 77\% faster in response
(15.98s vs. 3.71s). In conclusion, ProMediate provides a rigorous,
theory-grounded testbed to advance the development of proactive, socially
intelligent agents.

*Sandipan Majhi,Paheli Bhattacharya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种多阶段微调策略，利用原始和合成数据来适应低资源印地语旅游领域的问答任务，证明大模型可生成合成数据，小模型能有效适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言领域特定问答面临两个关键挑战：标注数据集稀缺和通用语言模型领域知识有限。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLaMA-70B、Phi-14B）生成合成问答对来扩充有限原始数据集，探索多种训练方法及其对领域泛化的影响。

Result: 大模型能高效生成合成数据，小模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展路径。

Conclusion: 多阶段微调策略结合合成数据增强，为低资源语言的领域特定问答任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

*Soumyadeep Jana,Sanasam Ranbir Singh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PEKD是一个通过知识蒸馏增强参数高效微调的统一框架，利用在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型作为教师，通过熵感知门控机制动态调整蒸馏强度，在少样本场景下显著提升多模态讽刺检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态讽刺检测在低资源环境下具有挑战性，因为图像-文本间的微妙矛盾难以从稀缺的标注数据中学习。现有的参数高效微调方法虽然减少了过拟合，但由于少样本数据的有限监督而难以达到最优性能。

Method: 提出PEKD框架，通过从在大规模讽刺数据上训练的专家模型进行知识蒸馏来增强PEFT方法。引入熵感知门控机制，根据教师模型的置信度动态调整蒸馏强度，以减轻不可靠信号的影响。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架使PEFT方法在少样本场景下超越了先前的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型，取得了强劲的结果。

Conclusion: PEKD是一个模块化且适应性强的框架，可广泛应用于各种多模态模型和任务，有效解决了低资源环境下多模态讽刺检测的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Parrot训练框架，通过整合自然语言链式思维(N-CoT)和程序链式思维(P-CoT)两种范式，实现相互增强，显著提升数学推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常单向增强N-CoT或P-CoT，本文旨在充分发挥两种范式的优势进行相互增强，实现同步改进。

Method: 1) 设计三个目标子任务整合顺序P-CoT和N-CoT生成；2) 采用子任务混合训练策略促进自然语言语义可转移性；3) 设计转换的N-CoT辅助奖励缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 实验表明Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT性能，特别是在N-CoT上。使用Parrot SFT，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别比资源密集的RL基线提升了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot框架成功实现了N-CoT和P-CoT的相互增强，为数学推理问题提供了一种有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商业代理领域面临复杂数据关系和多样化异构任务的挑战，需要提升语言代理在真实商业场景中的表现。

Method: 采用合成数据生成和基于强化学习的训练范式，并在推理阶段引入共享记忆机制，让代理从类似问题的任务指南中学习。

Result: 在CRMArena-Pro数据集上验证，轻量级模型在B2B和B2C业务场景中都取得了有竞争力的结果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了商业代理在复杂环境中的有效性和泛化能力，特别是在未见场景中，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of LLM-based agents, which
shed light on using language agents to solve complex real-world problems. A
prominent application lies in business agents, which interact with databases
and internal knowledge bases via tool calls to fulfill diverse user
requirements. However, this domain is characterized by intricate data
relationships and a wide range of heterogeneous tasks, from statistical data
queries to knowledge-based question-answering. To address these challenges, we
propose CRMWeaver, a novel approach that enhances business agents in such
complex settings. To acclimate the agentic model to intricate business
environments, we employ a synthesis data generation and RL-based paradigm
during training, which significantly improves the model's ability to handle
complex data and varied tasks. During inference, a shared memories mechanism is
introduced, prompting the agent to learn from task guidelines in similar
problems, thereby further boosting its effectiveness and generalization,
especially in unseen scenarios. We validate the efficacy of our approach on the
CRMArena-Pro dataset, where our lightweight model achieves competitive results
in both B2B and B2C business scenarios, underscoring its practical value for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对在法律解释中使用大语言模型，指出模型判断不稳定且与人类判断相关性弱


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对法律学者和联邦法官将大语言模型加入法律解释工具包的做法，提供实证论据反对这种实践

Method: 在英语环境中调查模型判断的稳定性，通过改变问题格式测试模型结论的一致性，并分析模型判断与人类判断的相关性

Result: 模型无法提供稳定的解释判断，问题格式的变化会导致截然不同的结论；模型与人类判断仅有弱到中等相关性，且在不同模型和问题变体间差异很大

Conclusion: 对生成式AI得出的结论给予过多信任是危险的，不应将大语言模型作为可靠的法律解释工具

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究小规模语言模型（100M和140M参数）是否能从指令调优中获益，探索人类启发式学习策略在低资源语言模型中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用解码器专用模型，比较对话和问答指令调优数据集，采用合并或顺序课程两种方式，在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP、EWoK、WUGs等）设置下进行评估。

Result: 指令调优在微调场景中带来小幅但一致的增益，顺序课程优于合并数据；但改进不持续转移到零样本任务，表明交互聚焦适应与广泛语言泛化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: 结果突出了在低资源语言模型中应用人类启发学习策略的潜力和约束，并指向基于课程的混合方法来增强生态训练限制下的泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统专家方法难以跟上快速演进的ICT领域创新周期和早期模糊术语，需要新的技术预测方法。

Method: 利用LLM从非结构化文本中提取语义三元组构建技术实体关系图，开发名词固定方法分组相似技术术语，使用基于图的指标检测融合信号，包括多阶段过滤、领域特定关键词聚类和时间趋势分析。

Result: 在arXiv预印本(278,625篇)和USPTO专利申请(9,793项)数据集上验证，能够识别已建立和新兴的技术融合模式。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一个基于全文分析的可扩展和通用技术预测框架。

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现引用次数与事实准确性呈强相关，超过约1000次引用的论文几乎被逐字记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在文献推荐中产生不存在论文的幻觉问题，研究假设引用次数作为训练数据冗余的代理指标，影响幻觉率。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成100个计算机科学领域的文献记录，通过余弦相似度手动验证生成与真实元数据的事实一致性。

Result: 发现(i)不同研究领域的幻觉率不同，(ii)引用次数与事实准确性强相关，(iii)超过约1000次引用的文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文在模型中被近乎逐字保留，表明存在从泛化到记忆的转变阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

Motivation: 心理健康AI发展受限于真实治疗对话数据的稀缺性，主要原因是隐私法规严格和历史记录不足。

Method: 基于认知行为疗法原则，使用结构化客户档案和心理问卷，通过治疗师-客户模拟生成合成治疗对话，采用开源LLM模型避免数据隐私问题。

Result: SQPsychLLM模型在心理咨询基准测试中表现优异，超越基线模型的关键治疗技能，专家评估验证了合成数据的质量。

Conclusion: 合成数据具有实现可扩展、数据安全且临床信息化的心理健康AI支持的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The development of AI for mental health is hindered by a lack of authentic
therapy dialogues, due to strict privacy regulations and the fact that clinical
sessions were historically rarely recorded. We present an LLM-driven pipeline
that generates synthetic counseling dialogues based on structured client
profiles and psychological questionnaires. Grounded on the principles of
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), our method creates synthetic therapeutic
conversations for clinical disorders such as anxiety and depression. Our
framework, SQPsych (Structured Questionnaire-based Psychotherapy), converts
structured psychological input into natural language dialogues through
therapist-client simulations. Due to data governance policies and privacy
restrictions prohibiting the transmission of clinical questionnaire data to
third-party services, previous methodologies relying on proprietary models are
infeasible in our setting. We address this limitation by generating a
high-quality corpus using open-weight LLMs, validated through human expert
evaluation and LLM-based assessments. Our SQPsychLLM models fine-tuned on
SQPsychConv achieve strong performance on counseling benchmarks, surpassing
baselines in key therapeutic skills. Our findings highlight the potential of
synthetic data to enable scalable, data-secure, and clinically informed AI for
mental health support. We will release our code, models, and corpus at

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1是首个针对印度知识系统的领域特定、多任务、双语基准测试，包含74,166个精心策划的问答对，涵盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀四大领域，用于评估LLMs在印度语境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要偏向英语文化且缺乏领域特异性，无法有效评估LLMs在印度语境下的表现，因此需要开发专门针对印度文化和领域的评估基准。

Method: 构建包含74,166个问答对的双语基准测试，其中52,494个英文和21,672个印地语，数据来源于真实的政府和领域特定考试，涵盖4大领域90+子领域500+主题。

Result: 评估29+个LLMs发现显著的领域和语言性能差距，GPT-4o在法律领域准确率达76.49%，但在阿育吠陀领域仅59.74%；所有模型在英文内容上表现均优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1为评估LLMs在印度多样化知识领域提供了全面数据集，能够评估模型整合领域特定知识与双语理解的能力，所有资源公开可用以支持开放研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型服务系统主要针对文本补全设计，对于日益复杂的LLM应用来说既不高效也不灵活，需要更适应性的架构。

Method: 提出了LLM推理程序(LIPs)的概念，允许用户在运行时自定义token预测和KV缓存管理，并将部分应用逻辑（如工具执行）卸载到服务器。实现了Symphony系统，通过系统调用暴露LLM模型计算，用专用文件系统虚拟化KV缓存，并采用两级进程调度方案确保GPU效率。

Result: Symphony系统能够更高效和可扩展地支持LLM应用，为LLM应用生态系统打开了新的可能性。

Conclusion: 通过服务程序而非提示词的新架构，结合Symphony系统的实现，能够显著提升LLM服务的效率和可扩展性，为复杂LLM应用提供更好的支持。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译数据集规模有限、多语言覆盖不足，且依赖专家标注和受控录制环境，成本高昂。VLMs的评估和实时辅助能力在手语数据获取方面尚未充分利用。

Method: 基于VLM的自动化流水线，包括人脸可见性检测、手语活动识别、视频内容文本提取以及视频-文本对齐验证，实施通用过滤、标注和验证步骤。

Result: 成功构建TikTok-SL-8数据集，并在德国手语和美国手语上评估了两个现成SLT模型的性能，为自动提取的轻微噪声数据建立了基准。

Conclusion: 该工作实现了SLT的可扩展弱监督预训练，促进了从社交媒体获取手语数据的能力，为手语研究提供了新的数据获取途径。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型理解隐含意义的能力及其对提升人机交互质量的影响。研究发现较大模型能更好地理解用户意图中的隐含信息，而基于隐含意义的提示能显著提高回复质量，特别是对小模型效果更明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，语言成为人机交互的核心。研究旨在探讨语言理论基础（特别是隐含意义）如何帮助解决人机对齐问题，使交互更加自然和情境化。

Method: 研究评估了不同规模LLM从情境驱动提示中推断用户意图的能力，并测试理解隐含意义是否能改善回复生成。通过比较模型对隐含意义提示和字面提示的响应表现。

Result: 较大模型更接近人类对隐含意义的理解，较小模型在推断隐含意义方面表现较差。基于隐含意义的提示显著提高了所有模型回复的相关性和质量，对小模型提升尤为明显。67.6%的参与者更喜欢基于隐含意义的回复。

Conclusion: 语言理论可以为解决人机对齐问题提供重要见解，通过理解和使用隐含意义，能够使人机交互更加自然和情境化，特别是在较小模型中实现显著改进。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

Method: 利用真实Lean Blueprint形式化项目，构建包含6个Lean项目中613个定理的评估套件，专注于研究级数学定理的挑战性评估。

Result: 在RLMEval上的评估显示，现有最先进模型仅达到10.3%的通过率，表明现有基准测试的进展难以转化到这些更现实的设置中。

Conclusion: RLMEval提供了一个新的、具有挑战性的基准，旨在指导和加速形式数学中自动推理的进展。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

### [124] [Depth and Autonomy: A Framework for Evaluating LLM Applications in Social Science Research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25432)
*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个框架，通过解释深度和自主性两个维度来分类LLM在定性研究中的应用，建议将任务分解为可管理部分，保持低自主性并在监督下选择性提高解释深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在定性社会科学研究中面临的解释偏见、低可靠性和弱可审计性等挑战。

Method: 基于Web of Science上所有使用LLM作为工具而非研究对象的已发表社会科学论文，分析LLM应用在解释深度和自主性两个维度上的现状。

Result: 开发了一个分类框架，能够系统评估LLM在定性研究中的应用方式，并提出具体的设计建议。

Conclusion: 通过保持低自主性和在监督下选择性提高解释深度，可以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时获得LLM的益处。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

TL;DR: 本文分析了手语翻译自动评估中文本指标的局限性，比较了BLEU、ROUGE等传统指标与LLM评估器的表现，发现文本指标在语义等价性捕捉方面存在不足，需要多模态评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手语翻译评估主要依赖文本指标，但这些指标是否能可靠评估SLT输出质量尚不明确，需要系统分析其局限性。

Method: 分析六种评估指标（BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT以及G-Eval、GEMBA等LLM评估器），在三种控制条件下测试其一致性和鲁棒性：释义、模型输出幻觉和句子长度变化。

Result: 词汇重叠指标存在局限性，LLM评估器能更好捕捉语义等价性但偏向LLM释义翻译；所有指标都能检测幻觉，但BLEU过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM评估器对细微案例较宽容。

Conclusion: 需要超越文本指标的多模态评估框架，以实现对手语翻译输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

TL;DR: Learn-to-Ask框架通过利用专家轨迹中的"观察未来"来学习主动对话代理，无需用户模拟器，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，在真实医疗数据上部署并超越人类专家表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM主要作为被动响应者，但在高风险领域需要它们成为主动、目标导向的合作伙伴。现有方法要么短视优化单轮属性，要么依赖脆弱的高成本用户模拟器，存在"现实差距"问题。

Method: 利用专家轨迹中的观察未来推断密集的逐轮奖励信号，将长时程问题分解为监督学习任务，训练策略输出结构化的(动作，状态评估)元组，控制"问什么"和"何时停止"。通过自动评分器校准管道净化基于LLM的奖励模型噪声。

Result: 在真实医疗数据集上使用高达32B参数的LLM验证了有效性，成功部署到大规模在线AI服务中，在内部评估中表现甚至优于人类专家。

Conclusion: 该框架为将被动LLM转化为主动、目标导向的LLM应用提供了实用且经济可行的蓝图，能够将离线数据转化为实际现实影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合微调大语言模型和命名实体识别的管道，用于高效的领域特定文本摘要和标记，特别针对快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决快速演变的亚文化语言和俚语对自动化信息提取和执法监控带来的挑战。

Method: 使用LLaMA Factory框架在通用和自定义领域特定数据集上微调大语言模型，特别是在政治和安全领域，并使用BLEU和ROUGE指标评估模型性能。

Result: 指令微调显著提高了摘要和标记的准确性，特别是在专业语料库中。LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域特定微调后，尽管初始中文理解能力有限，但表现优于中文训练模型，表明底层推理能力可以跨语言迁移。

Conclusion: 该管道能够生成简洁摘要和结构化实体标记，支持快速文档分类和分发，为现代知识管理和安全操作提供了可扩展和适应实时应用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

TL;DR: TwinVoice是一个评估LLM在真实世界场景中模拟人物角色的综合基准，涵盖社交、人际和叙事三个维度，分解为六项基本能力评估。实验显示先进模型在人物角色模拟方面表现中等，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上仍有不足，整体性能远低于人类基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的人物角色模拟评估存在局限：大多依赖合成对话、缺乏系统框架、缺少能力需求分析。为解决这些问题，需要开发更全面的评估基准。

Method: 引入TwinVoice基准，包含三个维度：社交角色（公共社交互动）、人际角色（私人对话）和叙事角色（基于角色的表达）。将LLM性能评估分解为六项基本能力：观点一致性、记忆回忆、逻辑推理、词汇保真度、角色语气和句法风格。

Result: 实验结果显示，先进模型在人物角色模拟方面达到中等准确率，但在句法风格和记忆回忆等能力上表现不足。LLM的平均性能显著低于人类基线水平。

Conclusion: 虽然先进LLM在人物角色模拟方面取得一定进展，但在关键能力如句法风格和记忆回忆方面仍有明显差距，需要进一步改进才能达到人类水平的模拟能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

Motivation: 虽然LLM智能体通常从行动规划角度研究如何完成目标，但它们在协作实现共同目标方面的能力尚未充分探索，特别是在信息不对称条件下。

Method: 采用微调加验证器框架，为LLM智能体配备不同沟通策略和环境验证信号，在扩展的爱因斯坦谜题游戏中进行实验。

Result: 实证结果显示对齐沟通的重要性，有趣的是无沟通的智能体也能达到高任务完成率，但缺乏真正的规则理解和人类评估者的信任。通过环境验证器增强了智能体的规则理解能力。

Conclusion: 集成基于环境的验证器可以增强智能体理解任务规则和完成任务的能力，促进AI系统中更安全、更可解释的协作。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM) agents are often approached from the angle
of action planning/generation to accomplish a goal (e.g., given by language
descriptions), their abilities to collaborate with each other to achieve a
joint goal are not well explored. To address this limitation, this paper
studies LLM agents in task collaboration, particularly under the condition of
information asymmetry, where agents have disparities in their knowledge and
skills and need to work together to complete a shared task. We extend Einstein
Puzzles, a classical symbolic puzzle, to a table-top game. In this game, two
LLM agents must reason, communicate, and act to satisfy spatial and relational
constraints required to solve the puzzle. We apply a fine-tuning-plus-verifier
framework in which LLM agents are equipped with various communication
strategies and verification signals from the environment. Empirical results
highlight the critical importance of aligned communication, especially when
agents possess both information-seeking and -providing capabilities.
Interestingly, agents without communication can still achieve high task
performance; however, further analysis reveals a lack of true rule
understanding and lower trust from human evaluators. Instead, by integrating an
environment-based verifier, we enhance agents' ability to comprehend task rules
and complete tasks, promoting both safer and more interpretable collaboration
in AI systems. https://github.com/Roihn/EinsteinPuzzles

TL;DR: FARSIQA是一个针对波斯语伊斯兰问答的端到端系统，采用创新的FAIR-RAG架构，通过自适应查询分解和迭代证据收集来解决复杂多跳查询问题，在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在宗教问答等高风险专业领域应用受限，存在幻觉问题且难以忠实于权威来源。波斯语穆斯林社区对准确性和可信度要求极高，现有RAG系统无法处理需要多步推理的复杂查询。

Method: 提出FAIR-RAG架构：一个忠实、自适应、迭代优化的RAG框架。系统动态分解复杂查询，评估证据充分性，通过迭代生成子查询逐步填补信息空白，基于超过100万权威伊斯兰文档的知识库。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中取得最先进性能：负面拒绝率达到97.0%（比基线提高40分），答案正确性得分达74.3%。

Conclusion: 该研究为波斯语伊斯兰问答设立了新标准，验证了迭代自适应架构对于在敏感领域构建忠实可靠AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

Method: 使用7种奖励模型家族，在5个法律多选问答基准上评估结果级和过程级验证方法，重点关注低预算条件下的表现。

Result: 系统分析了验证器效用的关键影响因素，包括领域专业化、模型规模、监督类型等属性。

Conclusion: 为法律领域测试时缩放技术的应用提供了实证研究，揭示了验证器在不同角色下的性能表现。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

TL;DR: 提出评估语言模型推理效率的框架，通过逻辑编程方法量化模型避免不必要推理的能力，发现当前模型在包含无关信息的场景中准确率显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估只关注正确性而忽略效率，但真实推理场景中大部分信息是无关的，有效推理需要识别和忽略干扰信息。

Method: 通过逻辑编程框架，将自然语言证明与逻辑程序找到的最短证明对齐，量化推理效率；构建包含不同数量无关公理的数学应用题数据集。

Result: 当前语言模型在包含无关信息的条件下准确率显著下降，即使是最小且领域一致的干扰也会影响性能，生成的证明经常包含无关推理的绕路。

Conclusion: 语言模型在推理效率方面存在不足，需要改进以更好地处理真实世界中的信息冗余场景。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含丰富但复杂的信息，现有大语言模型在分析EHR时存在任务覆盖范围有限和缺乏EHR导向推理能力的问题，需要开发专门针对EHR分析的解决方案。

Method: 使用思维图驱动框架生成大规模高质量EHR推理数据，开发EHR-R1系列模型，采用多阶段训练范式包括领域适应、推理增强和强化学习，构建EHR-Bench基准评估系统。

Result: EHR-R1在MIMIC-Bench上比GPT-4o高出30多分，在EHRSHOT上的零样本AUROC提高10%，在42个EHR任务上全面超越现有最先进的商业和开源大语言模型。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench共同推动了更可靠和临床相关的EHR分析发展，显著提升了电子健康记录自动分析的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一视觉语言模型需要在单一架构中同时执行理解和生成任务，但这些任务依赖异构数据和监督，在强化学习中难以平衡。

Method: 使用GPT-o3增强单任务数据，为理解样本生成描述，为生成样本生成问答对，形成对齐对；为每个生成样本检索语义相关的理解样本形成检索对；提出Pair-GPRO算法，基于组相对策略优化，通过相似度评分调节优势函数。

Result: 构建了包含16K理解-生成对的高质量数据集PairUG，在Janus-Pro等强大UVLM上评估，相比强基线实现了平衡的性能提升。

Conclusion: PairUni框架通过数据重组和配对感知优化，有效解决了统一视觉语言模型中理解和生成任务的平衡问题，在多个模型上表现出色。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Motivation: 探索LLM作为分类模型替代方案的适用性，特别是在结构化表格数据和高风险金融应用中的表现。

Method: 在真实贷款违约预测任务上系统比较零样本LLM分类器与LightGBM，使用SHAP分析特征归因，评估LLM自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLM能够识别关键金融风险指标，但其特征重要性排序与LightGBM显著不同，自解释与实证SHAP归因经常不一致。

Conclusion: LLM作为独立模型在结构化金融风险预测中存在局限性，其自解释的可信度存疑，需要可解释性审计、与可解释模型基线比较以及人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

TL;DR: Toolathlon是一个用于评估语言代理的基准测试，包含32个软件应用和604个工具，覆盖从日常平台到专业系统的广泛领域，提供真实环境状态和可靠执行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言代理基准测试往往局限于狭窄领域或简化任务，缺乏多样性、真实性和长期复杂性，无法评估代理在现实世界中的表现。

Method: 基于高质量MCP服务器构建工具集，提供来自真实软件的初始环境状态（如Canvas课程、财务电子表格），包含108个需要与多个应用交互的任务，平均约20个回合完成。

Result: 最先进模型表现显著不足：最佳模型Claude-4.5-Sonnet成功率仅38.6%，平均20.2次工具调用；最佳开源模型DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp成功率20.1%。

Conclusion: Toolathlon有望推动开发更强大的语言代理，以执行现实世界中的长期任务。

Abstract: Real-world language agents must handle complex, multi-step workflows across
diverse Apps. For instance, an agent may manage emails by coordinating with
calendars and file systems, or monitor a production database to detect
anomalies and generate reports following an operating manual. However, existing
language agent benchmarks often focus on narrow domains or simplified tasks
that lack the diversity, realism, and long-horizon complexity required to
evaluate agents' real-world performance. To address this gap, we introduce the
Tool Decathlon (dubbed as Toolathlon), a benchmark for language agents offering
diverse Apps and tools, realistic environment setup, and reliable
execution-based evaluation. Toolathlon spans 32 software applications and 604
tools, ranging from everyday platforms such as Google Calendar and Notion to
professional ones like WooCommerce, Kubernetes, and BigQuery. Most of the tools
are based on a high-quality set of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers that we
may have revised or implemented ourselves. Unlike prior works, which primarily
ensure functional realism but offer limited environment state diversity, we
provide realistic initial environment states from real software, such as Canvas
courses with dozens of students or real financial spreadsheets. This benchmark
includes 108 manually sourced or crafted tasks in total, requiring interacting
with multiple Apps over around 20 turns on average to complete. Each task is
strictly verifiable through dedicated evaluation scripts. Comprehensive
evaluation of SOTA models highlights their significant shortcomings: the
best-performing model, Claude-4.5-Sonnet, achieves only a 38.6% success rate
with 20.2 tool calling turns on average, while the top open-weights model
DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp reaches 20.1%. We expect Toolathlon to drive the development
of more capable language agents for real-world, long-horizon task execution.

### [137] [The Limits of Obliviate: Evaluating Unlearning in LLMs via Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25732)
*Aakriti Shah,Thai Le*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过说服性提示从已进行遗忘学习的大语言模型中恢复事实知识，提出了SKeB框架来评估遗忘学习的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中的遗忘学习对于管理敏感数据和纠正错误信息至关重要，但评估其有效性仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 基于ACT-R和Hebbian理论（扩散激活理论）以及传播学原理，提出了刺激-知识纠缠-行为框架（SKeB），通过领域图建模信息纠缠，测试事实回忆是否与说服性框架相关。

Result: 说服性提示显著增强了事实知识回忆（基线14.8% vs 权威框架24.5%），有效性随模型大小呈反比关系（2.7B模型恢复128% vs 13B模型恢复15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB为评估大语言模型中遗忘学习的完整性、鲁棒性和整体行为提供了基础框架。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

TL;DR: Ouro是一个预训练的循环语言模型家族，通过在潜在空间进行迭代计算、使用熵正则化目标分配学习深度，并扩展到7.7T令牌，将推理能力内置到预训练阶段，而非依赖训练后的显式文本生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LLM主要依赖显式文本生成（如思维链）进行推理，这推迟了推理能力的开发且未充分利用预训练数据。作者希望将推理能力直接构建到预训练阶段。

Method: 提出循环语言模型(LoopLM)：1) 在潜在空间进行迭代计算；2) 使用熵正则化目标分配学习深度；3) 扩展到7.7T令牌进行预训练。

Result: Ouro 1.4B和2.6B模型性能优异，在广泛基准测试中匹配了高达12B参数的最先进LLM。优势来自更好的知识操作能力而非知识容量增加。

Conclusion: 循环语言模型作为推理时代的新型扩展方向具有巨大潜力，其推理轨迹比显式思维链更符合最终输出。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,
such as chain-of-thought (CoT), which defers reasoning to post-training and
under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

TL;DR: 提出从一次性任务完成评估转向协作代理评估，引入协作努力扩展框架来衡量代理在用户参与增加时的效用增长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理评估聚焦于一次性任务完成，忽视了现实问题的迭代协作本质，人类目标往往不明确且会演变。

Method: 引入协作努力扩展框架，通过案例研究和模拟评估分析代理在多轮真实场景中的表现。

Result: 最先进的代理在多轮真实场景中表现不佳，缺乏维持参与和支持用户理解的能力。

Conclusion: 协作努力扩展为诊断代理行为和指导开发更有效交互提供了新视角。

Abstract: Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task
completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative
nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified
and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion
agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of
their final outputs but by how well they engage with and enhance human effort
throughout the problem-solving process. To support this shift, we introduce
collaborative effort scaling, a framework that captures how an agent's utility
grows with increasing user involvement. Through case studies and simulated
evaluations, we show that state-of-the-art agents often underperform in
multi-turn, real-world scenarios, revealing a missing ingredient in agent
design: the ability to sustain engagement and scaffold user understanding.
Collaborative effort scaling offers a lens for diagnosing agent behavior and
guiding development toward more effective interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表在研究论文中至关重要但制作复杂，现有图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图表，而LLM生成的SVG图表缺乏有效的评估指标。

Method: 将图表概念化为图结构，文本元素作为节点，连接关系作为有向边，使用节点对齐和路径对齐两组新指标进行评估。

Result: 首次有效评估了最先进LLM在最新研究文献上生成的图表，定量证明了所提指标的有效性。

Conclusion: DiagramEval提供了可解释的评估指标，为理解LLM生成图表的特性提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事后归因方法在抽取式问答中表现良好，但在多跳、抽象和半抽取式场景中表现不佳，这些场景需要跨段落合成信息。

Method: 提出DecompTune后训练方法，教导模型生成答案分解作为中间推理步骤，使用两阶段SFT + GRPO流水线进行训练。

Result: DecompTune显著提升了归因质量，优于先前方法，匹配或超越了最先进的边界模型。

Conclusion: 将归因重构为推理问题，通过答案分解可以显著改善长文档问答中的归因可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

TL;DR: Gaperon是一个完全开源的法国-英语-编程语言模型套件，包含1.5B、8B和24B参数模型，训练了2-4万亿token，并发布了完整的训练流程。研究发现数据过滤与污染会影响模型性能，并探讨了基准泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动大规模模型训练的透明度和可复现性，研究数据过滤和污染如何影响基准测试和生成性能，为多语言语言模型开发提供可复现基础。

Method: 使用神经质量分类器过滤法英数据集，开发高效数据整理和训练框架，发布数百个中间检查点，并在预训练中引入无害数据污染。

Result: 语言质量过滤能提升文本流畅性和连贯性但基准测试结果较差，后期故意污染能恢复竞争性分数但会适度损害生成质量，神经过滤可能无意中放大基准泄漏。

Conclusion: Gaperon为探索数据整理、评估、安全性和开放性之间的权衡提供了可复现的基础，支持多语言语言模型开发的进一步研究。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理树结构的RLVR数据调度方法Re-Schedule，通过r-score衡量查询学习难度，从简单到复杂构建课程，在6个数学推理基准上平均准确率提升达3.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径指标排序查询，忽视了查询的推理树结构，需要更强大的调度基础。

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)衡量查询学习难度，基于r-score提出推理树调度算法(Re-Schedule)，构建从结构简单到复杂的课程。

Result: 在6个数学推理基准上的实验显示，Re-Schedule显著提升平均准确率，增益最高达3.2%。

Conclusion: 对推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Motivation: 传统反事实推理框架假设无环结构因果模型，但许多真实系统包含反馈循环或循环依赖，违反无环性假设

Method: 在循环结构因果模型中研究反事实推理，特别关注shift-scale干预（软性、政策式变化，对变量机制进行重新缩放和/或平移）

Conclusion: 需要扩展反事实推理框架以处理包含循环依赖的真实世界系统

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic
structural causal models (SCMs), i.e. directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However,
many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study
counterfactual inference in cyclic SCMs under shift-scale interventions, i.e.,
soft, policy-style changes that rescale and/or shift a variable's mechanism.

Motivation: 自动化E/M编码可减轻医生文档负担、提高计费效率，最终改善患者护理，但真实世界复杂性使自动化具有挑战性

Method: 开发了基于LLM的ProFees框架，专门处理E/M编码中的复杂性问题

Result: 在专家策划的真实数据集上，ProFees比商业CPT E/M编码系统提高36%准确率，比最强单提示基线提高近5%

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了E/M编码自动化中的真实世界复杂性，显著提高了编码准确性

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在游戏交互中具有灵活性，但无法遵循规则治理的交易系统流程（浏览-报价-审查-确认），这会损害玩家信任。需要解决LLM创意灵活性与程序化交易需求之间的核心矛盾。

Method: 引入ASTP方法，通过精心设计的提示词强制LLM显式跟踪和报告状态标签，结合状态特定的占位符后处理方法确保交易完整性。

Result: 在300个交易对话评估中，实现了>99%的状态合规性和99.3%的计算精度。小模型(Gemini-2.5-Flash)使用ASTP后性能与大模型(Gemini-2.5-Pro)相当，响应时间从21.2秒降至2.4秒。

Conclusion: ASTP为商业游戏建立了实用基础，既满足实时性要求，又符合资源限制，同时保持了交易系统的程序完整性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练方法主要关注结果导向的奖励机制，缺乏对推理过程的考量，限制了大型推理模型的多步推理能力发展。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算标量一致性奖励，衡量策略模型的推理过程与预训练教师模型的匹配程度，结合标准答案/格式奖励进行组相对策略优化。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘实现推理感知的GRPO能够有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1是一个基于多阶段课程强化学习的KBQA方法，通过结果监督训练LLM进行自主推理，在少量数据下实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBQA方法通过过程监督微调LLM，但缺乏探索激励，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习：首先在高质量轨迹上微调LLM建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL来缓解奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA零样本子集上实现11.1%相对提升，仅使用十二分之一训练数据。

Conclusion: 基于结果监督的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理能力，证明了课程RL在增强LLM代理推理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three

*Juan Ren,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Agentic Moderation框架，利用专门代理防御多模态系统的越狱攻击，相比静态方法提供动态、协作的上下文感知和可解释的审核


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法多为静态层，只能提供二元分类（安全/不安全），缺乏上下文感知和可解释性。需要更灵活、动态的安全防御机制来应对复杂的越狱攻击

Method: 使用专门代理（Shield、Responder、Evaluator、Reflector）的模型无关框架，实现动态协作的上下文感知审核

Result: 在5个数据集和4个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，攻击成功率降低7-19%，拒绝率提高4-20%，保持稳定的不跟随率

Conclusion: Agentic Moderation通过代理架构的灵活性和推理能力，提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了代理系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EneAD框架，通过自适应感知模块和鲁棒决策模块，在保持感知精度的同时显著降低自动驾驶系统的能耗，提升电动车的续航里程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶技术虽然带来诸多益处，但其计算引擎的能耗问题日益突出，特别是感知计算作为最耗电的组件，限制了电动车的续航里程。现有模型压缩方法往往导致模型尺寸过大或感知精度显著下降。

Method: 1. 自适应感知模块：管理多个不同计算消耗的感知模型，动态调整执行帧率；基于贝叶斯优化的可迁移调优方法寻找最优参数组合；轻量级分类模型区分不同场景的感知难度。2. 鲁棒决策模块：基于强化学习的决策模型，设计正则化项增强面对扰动感知结果时的驾驶稳定性。

Result: EneAD能够将感知能耗降低1.9倍到3.5倍，从而将驾驶里程提升3.9%到8.5%。

Conclusion: EneAD框架在能耗和驾驶性能方面均表现出优越性，为解决自动驾驶能耗问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出RAVR框架，通过答案引导的变分推理来改进LLM的推理能力，解决了在LLM当前能力之外的任务中难以采样高质量推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学启发，发现"为什么是这个答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为避免了开放式探索的认知负担，转而进行解释性重建。LLM可以利用答案来推导高质量推理路径。

Method: 引入RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代，通过答案引导来提升推理路径的质量。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验显示，RAVR相比强基线方法取得了持续改进，减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 答案条件推理能显著提高采样推理路径的期望效用，将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，为LLM推理能力提升提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

TL;DR: FELA是一个基于LLM的多代理进化系统，用于从复杂的工业事件日志数据中自动提取高性能特征。它结合了LLM的推理编码能力和洞察引导的自我进化范式，通过专门代理协作生成、验证和实施特征创意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志数据复杂且异构，现有自动特征工程方法存在可解释性差、操作僵化、适应性弱等问题。需要开发能够处理大规模、高维度、多类型数据的自动化特征工程解决方案。

Method: 采用多代理系统架构，包括创意代理、代码代理、批评代理和评估代理。结合强化学习和遗传算法原理，实现想法空间的探索与利用平衡。使用分层知识库和双记忆系统支持持续改进。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能够生成可解释的、领域相关的特征，显著提升模型性能，同时减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多代理系统为复杂现实环境中的自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程提供了一个通用框架，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图基规划建模任务依赖关系，实现自适应并行和串行工具执行，显著提升多步推理任务的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主代理（如ReAct）采用顺序推理和执行，无法利用独立子任务的固有并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: 训练代理基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定哪些工具可以并行执行，哪些必须遵循顺序依赖。采用两阶段训练策略：在高质量图规划数据集上进行监督微调，然后在策略性采样查询上使用基于正确性的奖励函数进行强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验结果表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，同时通过智能并行化实现了工具调用效率的显著提升。

Conclusion: 图基代理规划框架通过依赖感知编排，在保持任务准确性的同时大幅提高了执行效率，为复杂任务解决提供了更高效的范式。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了KVDA-UCT方法，通过分析即时奖励来推断状态-动作对之间的价值差异，从而比现有的OGA-UCT方法检测到更多抽象，在多种确定性环境中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCTS抽象算法OGA-UCT要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，影响了样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，打破价值等价分组的范式，允许分组具有不同价值的状态-动作对，只要它们的价值差异可以被推断。基于此开发了KVDA-UCT方法。

Result: KVDA-UCT比OGA-UCT检测到显著更多的抽象，没有引入额外参数，在多种确定性环境和参数设置下表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，有效提升了MCTS的抽象能力和样本效率。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Method: 采用PRISMA系统文献综述方法，分析了2018-2025年间的90项研究，构建了双范式分析框架，从理论基础、领域应用和伦理治理三个维度进行系统分析。

Result: 发现范式选择具有战略性：符号系统主导安全关键领域（如医疗），神经系统在适应性强的数据丰富环境中占优势（如金融）；识别出符号系统治理模型不足和神经符号混合架构需求等关键研究空白。

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于两种范式的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统，为未来研究、开发和政策提供概念工具包。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Motivation: 传统AI对齐理论将工具性目标视为风险来源，试图限制其症状。本文认为这种观点存在局限，需要新的理论框架来更好地处理工具性目标。

Method: 借鉴亚里士多德本体论及其现代解释，构建哲学论证，将高级AI系统视为具有形式和物质构成的实体，其工具性倾向是其构成的固有结果。

Conclusion: AI对齐工作应更多关注理解、管理和引导工具性目标，而非试图消除它们，这有助于更好地实现人类对齐的目标。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤中无缝集成数据库执行反馈，扩展GRPO算法以适应复杂多轮交互场景，并添加轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束。

Conclusion: MTIR-SQL框架通过动态执行反馈和多轮推理机制有效提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,

standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致的经验，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于微调大语言模型联盟和推理LLM的决策支持系统，用于精神障碍的临床诊断，通过共识决策过程提高诊断准确性和标准化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统精神疾病诊断主要依赖医患对话，具有主观性和诊断不一致的问题，需要标准化方法来提高诊断可靠性。

Method: 使用基于医患对话数据集微调的LLMs，通过共识决策过程聚合个体模型预测，并由OpenAI-gpt-oss推理LLM进行精炼，部署LLM代理协调整个诊断流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合微调LLMs和推理模型可以创建稳健且高精度的精神健康评估诊断系统，原型系统已与美国陆军医学研究团队合作开发。

Conclusion: 这是首个将微调LLM联盟与推理LLM集成用于临床精神健康诊断的应用，为下一代AI驱动的电子健康系统标准化精神科诊断铺平了道路。

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

TL;DR: 提出了CAIR方法，首个用于评估Agentic AI Workflow中各个智能体对最终输出影响力的方法，通过反事实分析进行任务无关的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AAW系统的高度自主性和广泛应用，需要从质量和安全角度深入理解其运作机制，但目前缺乏评估各智能体对最终输出影响的方法。

Method: 使用反事实分析技术，通过修改智能体的输出来评估其对AAW最终输出的影响程度，提供任务无关的分析方法。

Result: 在包含30个用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务的效果和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够有效评估AAW中智能体影响力的方法，支持离线和推理时分析，为理解和改进AAW系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个多轮强化学习框架，通过将视觉语言模型训练为交互式代理，使其能够主动导航长文档。它引入了按索引直接访问页面的fetch动作，并采用跨级别奖励和视觉语义锚定机制来解决训练稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在处理需要跨多页分析和整合信息的长文档时表现不佳，现有方法依赖固定的推理模板或刚性流程，限制了模型的效率和泛化能力。

Method: ALDEN采用多轮强化学习框架，引入fetch动作直接按索引访问页面，提出基于规则的跨级别奖励进行密集过程监督，并使用视觉语义锚定机制通过双路径KL散度约束来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的代理迈出了一步，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Motivation: 随着无人机在城市区域（用于配送和监控）的日益普及，需要开发能够在复杂城市气流环境中有效导航的智能策略。

Method: 提出了一种基于深度强化学习的导航策略，使用PPO算法结合GTrXL架构，并融入了对湍流场的感知能力，通过三维高保真城市流场模拟进行训练。

Result: 与PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL（无辅助预测任务）和传统Zermelo导航算法相比，该方法显著提高了成功率（SR）并降低了碰撞率（CR）。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂城市环境中无人机的导航开辟了新途径，有望重新定义无人机在城市环境中的应用前景。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索增强生成方法独立处理检索块，难以进行多跳或关系推理；而标准知识图谱会丢失不符合三元组结构的信息。

Method: 提出BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上添加基于频率的权重，体现链接强度，借鉴赫布原理。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现优于现有解决方案。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率加权的非三元组边有效改善了知识图谱的信息保留能力，提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

TL;DR: TheraMind是一个用于纵向心理咨询的战略性自适应代理，采用双循环架构解决现有LLM在心理咨询中缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和长期记忆的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理咨询LLM方法缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和跨多会话的治疗方法使用，与真实临床实践差距较大。

Method: 提出双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中的广泛评估显示，TheraMind在多会话指标（如连贯性、灵活性和治疗协调性）上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 双循环设计在模拟战略性、自适应和纵向治疗行为方面有效，验证了该架构的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

Motivation: 随机PDE求解器在几何处理和图形学中很有用，但偏中心估计器在近似格林函数时会引入相关伪影和偏差。

Method: 使用局部相似性过滤和原则性加权策略，选择性地结合相邻评估点的样本，抑制不可靠的估计器。

Result: 在各种PDE上（包括筛选泊松方程和边界条件）相比现有求解器（如vanilla Walk on Spheres、均值缓存和边界值缓存）取得了一致的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡偏差和方差，并自然地扩展到梯度场估计和混合边界问题。

Abstract: Stochastic PDE solvers have emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional
discretization-based methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs),
especially in geometry processing and graphics. While off-centered estimators
enhance sample reuse in WoS-type Monte Carlo solvers, they introduce
correlation artifacts and bias when Green's functions are approximated. In this
paper, we propose a statistically weighted off-centered WoS-type estimator that
leverages local similarity filtering to selectively combine samples across
neighboring evaluation points. Our method balances bias and variance through a
principled weighting strategy that suppresses unreliable estimators. We
demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on various PDEs,including screened
Poisson equations and boundary conditions, achieving consistent improvements
over existing solvers such as vanilla Walk on Spheres, mean value caching, and
boundary value caching. Our method also naturally extends to gradient field
estimation and mixed boundary problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 修剪曲面上的点包含查询在CAD建模、实体几何处理和曲面细分中至关重要。现有方法如光线投射和广义环绕数在鲁棒性和计算效率方面存在局限性。

Method: 采用递归环绕数计算方案，用基于椭圆的边界替代昂贵的曲线细分来处理贝塞尔段。对于周期性曲面，将修剪曲线提升到通用覆盖空间，确保在参数域中非可收缩或不连续环路的准确环绕数计算。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比现有环绕数算法实现了显著加速，同时在几何噪声、开放边界和周期性拓扑存在的情况下保持高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实B-Rep模型处理和修剪曲面鲁棒细分中表现出有效性，为CAD建模和几何处理提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Point containment queries on trimmed surfaces are fundamental to CAD
modeling, solid geometry processing, and surface tessellation. Existing
approaches such as ray casting and generalized winding numbers often face
limitations in robustness and computational efficiency.
  We propose a fast and numerically stable method for performing containment
queries on trimmed surfaces, including those with periodic parameterizations.
Our approach introduces a recursive winding number computation scheme that
replaces costly curve subdivision with an ellipse-based bound for Bezier
segments, enabling linear-time evaluation. For periodic surfaces, we lift
trimming curves to the universal covering space, allowing accurate and
consistent winding number computation even for non-contractible or
discontinuous loops in parameter domain.
  Experiments show that our method achieves substantial speedups over existing
winding-number algorithms while maintaining high robustness in the presence of
geometric noise, open boundaries, and periodic topologies. We further
demonstrate its effectiveness in processing real B-Rep models and in robust
tessellation of trimmed surfaces.

TL;DR: 提出了文本到3D草图动画的新任务，开发了首个无需训练的框架4-Doodle，通过双空间蒸馏方案从预训练扩散模型生成动态3D矢量草图，解决了多视角一致性和时间连贯性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有工作主要关注逼真内容生成，而忽略了轻量级、可解释的3D矢量草图这一适合视觉交流和原型设计的媒介。该任务面临三大挑战：缺乏配对数据、草图结构抽象难以建模、现有方法无法保证时间连贯性和多视角一致性。

Method: 采用双空间蒸馏方案：一个空间使用可微分贝塞尔曲线捕捉多视角一致的几何结构，另一个空间通过时间感知先验编码运动动态。引入多视角优化确保结构对齐，以及结构感知运动模块分离形状保持轨迹和变形感知变化。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够生成时间上真实、结构上稳定的3D草图动画，在保真度和可控性方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现更直观、易访问的4D内容创作迈出了重要一步，展示了在缺乏配对数据情况下生成高质量3D草图动画的可行性。

Abstract: We present a novel task: text-to-3D sketch animation, which aims to bring
freeform sketches to life in dynamic 3D space. Unlike prior works focused on
photorealistic content generation, we target sparse, stylized, and
view-consistent 3D vector sketches, a lightweight and interpretable medium
well-suited for visual communication and prototyping. However, this task is
very challenging: (i) no paired dataset exists for text and 3D (or 4D)
sketches; (ii) sketches require structural abstraction that is difficult to
model with conventional 3D representations like NeRFs or point clouds; and
(iii) animating such sketches demands temporal coherence and multi-view
consistency, which current pipelines do not address. Therefore, we propose
4-Doodle, the first training-free framework for generating dynamic 3D sketches
from text. It leverages pretrained image and video diffusion models through a
dual-space distillation scheme: one space captures multi-view-consistent
geometry using differentiable B\'ezier curves, while the other encodes motion
dynamics via temporally-aware priors. Unlike prior work (e.g., DreamFusion),
which optimizes from a single view per step, our multi-view optimization
ensures structural alignment and avoids view ambiguity, critical for sparse
sketches. Furthermore, we introduce a structure-aware motion module that
separates shape-preserving trajectories from deformation-aware changes,
enabling expressive motion such as flipping, rotation, and articulated
movement. Extensive experiments show that our method produces temporally
realistic and structurally stable 3D sketch animations, outperforming existing
baselines in both fidelity and controllability. We hope this work serves as a
step toward more intuitive and accessible 4D content creation.

Conclusion: mitransient有望支持研究社区开发新型瞬态成像算法，促进瞬态成像领域的发展。

Abstract: mitransient is a light transport simulation tool that extends Mitsuba 3 with
support for time-resolved simulations. In essence, mitransient extends
conventional rendering by adding a temporal dimension which accounts for the
time of flight of light. This allows rapid prototyping of novel transient
imaging systems without the need of costly or difficult-to-operate hardware.
Our code is trivially easy to install through pip, and consists of Python
modules that can run both in CPU and GPU by leveraging the JIT capabilities of
Mitsuba 3. It provides physically-based simulations of complex phenomena,
including a wide variety of realistic materials and participating media such as
fog or smoke. In addition, we extend Mitsuba 3's functionality to support
time-resolved polarization tracking of light and transient differentiable
rendering. Finally, we also include tools that simplify the use of our
simulations for non-line-of-sight imaging, enabling realistic scene setups with
capture noise to be simulated in just seconds of minutes. Altogether, we hope
that mitransient will support the research community in developing novel
algorithms for transient imaging.
