### [1] [Multimodal AI for Body Fat Estimation: Computer Vision and Anthropometry with DEXA Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17576)
*Rayan Aldajani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了使用AI模型通过正面身体图像和基本人体测量数据作为低成本体脂率估算替代方案的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追踪体脂率对有效体重管理至关重要，但金标准方法如DEXA扫描对大多数人来说仍然昂贵且难以获得。

Method: 开发了两种方法：(1)基于ResNet的图像模型和(2)使用人体测量数据的回归模型。数据集包含535个样本，包括253个人体测量数据和282张从Reddit获取的图像。

Result: 基于图像的模型实现了4.44%的均方根误差和0.807的决定系数，表明AI模型可以提供可访问的低成本体脂估算。

Conclusion: AI辅助模型能够提供可访问且低成本的体脂估算，支持未来健康和健身领域的消费者应用。

Abstract: Tracking body fat percentage is essential for effective weight management, yet gold-standard methods such as DEXA scans remain expensive and inaccessible for most people. This study evaluates the feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) models as low-cost alternatives using frontal body images and basic anthropometric data. The dataset consists of 535 samples: 253 cases with recorded anthropometric measurements (weight, height, neck, ankle, and wrist) and 282 images obtained via web scraping from Reddit posts with self-reported body fat percentages, including some reported as DEXA-derived by the original posters. Because no public datasets exist for computer-vision-based body fat estimation, this dataset was compiled specifically for this study. Two approaches were developed: (1) ResNet-based image models and (2) regression models using anthropometric measurements. A multimodal fusion framework is also outlined for future expansion once paired datasets become available. The image-based model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 4.44% and a Coefficient of Determination (R^2) of 0.807. These findings demonstrate that AI-assisted models can offer accessible and low-cost body fat estimates, supporting future consumer applications in health and fitness.

### [2] [Reconstruction-Driven Multimodal Representation Learning for Automated Media Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17596)
*Yassir Benhammou,Suman Kalyan,Sujay Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态自动编码器(MMAE)，通过联合重构损失学习跨文本、音频和视觉数据的统一表示，用于广播内容的元数据提取和语义聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统通常只处理单一模态，限制了其对广播材料中复杂跨模态关系的理解，需要开发能够统一处理多模态内容的方法。

Method: 使用多模态自动编码器(MMAE)，在LUMA数据集上训练，通过最小化跨模态的联合重构损失来学习模态不变的语义结构。

Result: 在聚类和对齐指标(Silhouette、ARI、NMI)上相比线性基线有显著提升，表明基于重构的多模态嵌入可作为可扩展元数据生成和跨模态检索的基础。

Conclusion: 重构驱动的多模态学习有潜力提升现代广播工作流中的自动化、可搜索性和内容管理效率。

Abstract: Broadcast and media organizations increasingly rely on artificial intelligence to automate the labor-intensive processes of content indexing, tagging, and metadata generation. However, existing AI systems typically operate on a single modality-such as video, audio, or text-limiting their understanding of complex, cross-modal relationships in broadcast material. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Autoencoder (MMAE) that learns unified representations across text, audio, and visual data, enabling end-to-end automation of metadata extraction and semantic clustering. The model is trained on the recently introduced LUMA dataset, a fully aligned benchmark of multimodal triplets representative of real-world media content. By minimizing joint reconstruction losses across modalities, the MMAE discovers modality-invariant semantic structures without relying on large paired or contrastive datasets. We demonstrate significant improvements in clustering and alignment metrics (Silhouette, ARI, NMI) compared to linear baselines, indicating that reconstruction-based multimodal embeddings can serve as a foundation for scalable metadata generation and cross-modal retrieval in broadcast archives. These results highlight the potential of reconstruction-driven multimodal learning to enhance automation, searchability, and content management efficiency in modern broadcast workflows.

Abstract: Wildfire risk prediction remains a critical yet challenging task due to the complex interactions among fuel conditions, meteorology, topography, and human activity. Despite growing interest in data-driven approaches, publicly available benchmark datasets that support long-term temporal modeling, large-scale spatial coverage, and multimodal drivers remain scarce. To address this gap, we present a 25-year, daily-resolution wildfire dataset covering 240 million hectares across British Columbia and surrounding regions. The dataset includes 38 covariates, encompassing active fire detections, weather variables, fuel conditions, terrain features, and anthropogenic factors. Using this benchmark, we evaluate a diverse set of time-series forecasting models, including CNN-based, linear-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based architectures. We also investigate effectiveness of position embedding and the relative importance of different fire-driving factors. The dataset and the corresponding code can be found at https://github.com/SynUW/mmFire

### [4] [Novel View Synthesis from A Few Glimpses via Test-Time Natural Video Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17932)
*Yan Xu,Yixing Wang,Stella X. Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

Result: 在LLFF、DTU、DL3DV和MipNeRF-360数据集上，该方法在极端稀疏条件下显著优于强3D-GS基线。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从稀疏输入生成连贯、高保真的渲染结果，无需任何场景特定训练或微调。

Abstract: Given just a few glimpses of a scene, can you imagine the movie playing out as the camera glides through it? That's the lens we take on \emph{sparse-input novel view synthesis}, not only as filling spatial gaps between widely spaced views, but also as \emph{completing a natural video} unfolding through space.
  We recast the task as \emph{test-time natural video completion}, using powerful priors from \emph{pretrained video diffusion models} to hallucinate plausible in-between views. Our \emph{zero-shot, generation-guided} framework produces pseudo views at novel camera poses, modulated by an \emph{uncertainty-aware mechanism} for spatial coherence. These synthesized frames densify supervision for \emph{3D Gaussian Splatting} (3D-GS) for scene reconstruction, especially in under-observed regions. An iterative feedback loop lets 3D geometry and 2D view synthesis inform each other, improving both the scene reconstruction and the generated views.
  The result is coherent, high-fidelity renderings from sparse inputs \emph{without any scene-specific training or fine-tuning}. On LLFF, DTU, DL3DV, and MipNeRF-360, our method significantly outperforms strong 3D-GS baselines under extreme sparsity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了透视畸变对多模态大语言模型（如Gemini-1.5-pro）在文档数据提取任务中性能的影响，发现结构识别准确率会显著下降，但可通过简单的旋转校正来改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的文档图像通常不仅存在平面内旋转，还存在透视畸变，这些扰动可能影响多模态LLMs在OCR任务中的数据提取准确性。

Method: 通过观察典型文档图像畸变，发现大多数近似遵循等腰梯形变换，将独立参数从8个减少到2个（旋转角度和畸变比例），然后在合成生成的样本文档上提取特定实体。

Result: 文档畸变显著降低了结构识别准确率（与阅读顺序正确性相关），而字符识别准确率相对稳定。简单的旋转校正可以改善结构识别性能。

Conclusion: 透视畸变对多模态LLMs在OCR任务中的结构识别性能有显著负面影响，但通过简单的旋转校正可以缓解这一问题，这对多模态LLMs在OCR任务中的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for data extraction from documents is essential to intelligent informatics, such as digitizing medical records and recognizing road signs. Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs) can solve this task and have shown remarkable performance. Recently, it has been noticed that the accuracy of data extraction by multi-modal LLMs can be affected when in-plane rotations are present in the documents. However, real-world document images are usually not only in-plane rotated but also perspectively distorted. This study investigates the impacts of such perturbations on the data extraction accuracy for the state-of-the-art model, Gemini-1.5-pro. Because perspective distortions have a high degree of freedom, designing experiments in the same manner as single-parametric rotations is difficult. We observed typical distortions of document images and showed that most of them approximately follow an isosceles-trapezoidal transformation, which allows us to evaluate distortions with a small number of parameters. We were able to reduce the number of independent parameters from eight to two, i.e. rotation angle and distortion ratio. Then, specific entities were extracted from synthetically generated sample documents with varying these parameters. As the performance of LLMs, we evaluated not only a character-recognition accuracy but also a structure-recognition accuracy. Whereas the former represents the classical indicators for optical character recognition, the latter is related to the correctness of reading order. In particular, the structure-recognition accuracy was found to be significantly degraded by document distortion. In addition, we found that this accuracy can be improved by a simple rotational correction. This insight will contribute to the practical use of multi-modal LLMs for OCR tasks.

### [6] [MimiCAT: Mimic with Correspondence-Aware Cascade-Transformer for Category-Free 3D Pose Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18370)
*Zenghao Chai,Chen Tang,Yongkang Wong,Xulei Yang,Mohan Kankanhalli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MimiCAT模型，用于实现类别无关的3D姿态迁移，能够将不同结构角色（如人形到四足动物）的姿态进行迁移，解决了现有方法局限于相似结构角色的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D姿态迁移方法主要局限于相似结构的角色之间，无法泛化到类别无关的设置（如将人形姿态迁移到四足动物）。主要挑战在于不同角色类型之间的结构和变换多样性，导致区域不匹配和迁移质量差。

Method: 构建了百万规模的跨数百个不同角色的姿态数据集；提出MimiCAT级联transformer模型，利用语义关键点标签学习软对应关系，实现灵活的多对多匹配；将姿态迁移表述为条件生成过程，首先通过软对应匹配将源变换投影到目标，然后使用形状条件表示进行细化。

Result: 广泛的定性和定量实验表明，MimiCAT能够在不同角色之间迁移合理的姿态，显著优于先前局限于狭窄类别迁移的方法。

Conclusion: MimiCAT通过软对应学习和条件生成方法，成功实现了类别无关的3D姿态迁移，突破了现有方法的结构限制，为跨类别姿态迁移提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D pose transfer aims to transfer the pose-style of a source mesh to a target character while preserving both the target's geometry and the source's pose characteristic. Existing methods are largely restricted to characters with similar structures and fail to generalize to category-free settings (e.g., transferring a humanoid's pose to a quadruped). The key challenge lies in the structural and transformation diversity inherent in distinct character types, which often leads to mismatched regions and poor transfer quality. To address these issues, we first construct a million-scale pose dataset across hundreds of distinct characters. We further propose MimiCAT, a cascade-transformer model designed for category-free 3D pose transfer. Instead of relying on strict one-to-one correspondence mappings, MimiCAT leverages semantic keypoint labels to learn a novel soft correspondence that enables flexible many-to-many matching across characters. The pose transfer is then formulated as a conditional generation process, in which the source transformations are first projected onto the target through soft correspondence matching and subsequently refined using shape-conditioned representations. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that MimiCAT transfers plausible poses across different characters, significantly outperforming prior methods that are limited to narrow category transfer (e.g., humanoid-to-humanoid).

Abstract: Accurate 3D ground truth estimation is critical for applications such as autonomous navigation, surveillance, and robotics. This paper introduces a novel method that uses an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) to fuse 2D bounding box or pose keypoint ground truth annotations from multiple calibrated cameras into accurate 3D ground truth. By leveraging human-annotated ground-truth 2D, our proposed method, a multi-camera single-object tracking algorithm, transforms 2D image coordinates into robust 3D world coordinates through homography-based projection and UKF-based fusion. Our proposed algorithm processes multi-view data to estimate object positions and shapes while effectively handling challenges such as occlusion. We evaluate our method on the CMC, Wildtrack, and Panoptic datasets, demonstrating high accuracy in 3D localization compared to the available 3D ground truth. Unlike existing approaches that provide only ground-plane information, our method also outputs the full 3D shape of each object. Additionally, the algorithm offers a scalable and fully automatic solution for multi-camera systems using only 2D image annotations.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a leading method for novel view synthesis, offering superior training efficiency and real-time inference compared to NeRF approaches, while still delivering high-quality reconstructions. Beyond view synthesis, this 3D representation has also been explored for editing tasks. Many existing methods leverage 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view datasets for training, but they often suffer from limitations such as view inconsistencies, lack of fine-grained control, and high computational demand. In this work, we focus specifically on the editing task of recoloring. We introduce a user-friendly pipeline that enables precise selection and recoloring of regions within a pre-trained Gaussian Splatting scene. To demonstrate the real-time performance of our method, we also present an interactive tool that allows users to experiment with the pipeline in practice.

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效增强低光照交通场景的可见度，保持结构完整性，并提高下游感知任务的可靠性，无需配对的真实图像进行训练。

Abstract: Enhancing low-light traffic images is crucial for reliable perception in autonomous driving, intelligent transportation, and urban surveillance systems. Nighttime and dimly lit traffic scenes often suffer from poor visibility due to low illumination, noise, motion blur, non-uniform lighting, and glare from vehicle headlights or street lamps, which hinder tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. To address these challenges, we propose a fully unsupervised multi-stage deep learning framework for low-light traffic image enhancement. The model decomposes images into illumination and reflectance components, progressively refined by three specialized modules: (1) Illumination Adaptation, for global and local brightness correction; (2) Reflectance Restoration, for noise suppression and structural detail recovery using spatial-channel attention; and (3) Over-Exposure Compensation, for reconstructing saturated regions and balancing scene luminance. The network is trained using self-supervised reconstruction, reflectance smoothness, perceptual consistency, and domain-aware regularization losses, eliminating the need for paired ground-truth images. Experiments on general and traffic-specific datasets demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE) and qualitative visual quality. Our approach enhances visibility, preserves structure, and improves downstream perception reliability in real-world low-light traffic scenarios.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a leading approach for high-quality novel view synthesis, with numerous variants extending its applicability to a broad spectrum of 3D and 4D scene reconstruction tasks. Despite its success, the representational capacity of 3DGS remains limited by the use of 3D Gaussian kernels to model local variations. Recent works have proposed to augment 3DGS with additional per-primitive capacity, such as per-splat textures, to enhance its expressiveness. However, these per-splat texture approaches primarily target dense novel view synthesis with a reduced number of Gaussian primitives, and their effectiveness tends to diminish when applied to more general reconstruction scenarios. In this paper, we aim to achieve concrete performance improvement over state-of-the-art 3DGS variants across a wide range of reconstruction tasks, including novel view synthesis, geometry and dynamic reconstruction, under both sparse and dense input settings. To this end, we introduce Neural Texture Splatting (NTS). At the core of our approach is a global neural field (represented as a hybrid of a tri-plane and a neural decoder) that predicts local appearance and geometric fields for each primitive. By leveraging this shared global representation that models local texture fields across primitives, we significantly reduce model size and facilitate efficient global information exchange, demonstrating strong generalization across tasks. Furthermore, our neural modeling of local texture fields introduces expressive view- and time-dependent effects, a critical aspect that existing methods fail to account for. Extensive experiments show that Neural Texture Splatting consistently improves models and achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HSMix是一种用于医学语义分割的局部图像编辑数据增强方法，通过硬混合和软混合技术结合两个源图像的同质区域来生成增强图像，同时保留局部语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割常因标注成本高或罕见疾病导致数据稀缺和过拟合问题。现有自监督和半监督学习方法复杂，而数据增强是更简单直接的解决方案，但局部图像编辑增强技术在分割任务中的有效性尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出HSMix方法：1）硬增强：结合两个源图像的同质区域（超像素）创建增强图像；2）软混合：基于局部聚合的像素级显著性系数调整亮度；3）对源图像的ground-truth分割掩码执行相同的混合操作生成对应的增强掩码。

Result: 广泛实验证明了该方法在各种医学分割任务中的有效性，能够充分利用先验轮廓和显著性信息，在保留局部语义信息的同时丰富增强空间的多样性。

Conclusion: HSMix是一种即插即用、模型无关的解决方案，适用于多种医学成像模态，能有效缓解医学图像分割中的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotation or the rarity of some diseases, medical image segmentation is often limited by data scarcity and the resulting overfitting problem. Self-supervised learning and semi-supervised learning can mitigate the data scarcity challenge to some extent. However, both of these paradigms are complex and require either hand-crafted pretexts or well-defined pseudo-labels. In contrast, data augmentation represents a relatively simple and straightforward approach to addressing data scarcity issues. It has led to significant improvements in image recognition tasks. However, the effectiveness of local image editing augmentation techniques in the context of segmentation has been less explored. We propose HSMix, a novel approach to local image editing data augmentation involving hard and soft mixing for medical semantic segmentation. In our approach, a hard-augmented image is created by combining homogeneous regions (superpixels) from two source images. A soft mixing method further adjusts the brightness of these composed regions with brightness mixing based on locally aggregated pixel-wise saliency coefficients. The ground-truth segmentation masks of the two source images undergo the same mixing operations to generate the associated masks for the augmented images. Our method fully exploits both the prior contour and saliency information, thus preserving local semantic information in the augmented images while enriching the augmentation space with more diversity. Our method is a plug-and-play solution that is model agnostic and applicable to a range of medical imaging modalities. Extensive experimental evidence has demonstrated its effectiveness in a variety of medical segmentation tasks. The source code is available in https://github.com/DanielaPlusPlus/HSMix.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting can exploit frustum culling and level-of-detail strategies to accelerate rendering of scenes containing a large number of primitives. However, the semi-transparent nature of Gaussians prevents the application of another highly effective technique: occlusion culling. We address this limitation by proposing a novel method to learn the viewpoint-dependent visibility function of all Gaussians in a trained model using a small, shared MLP across instances of an asset in a scene. By querying it for Gaussians within the viewing frustum prior to rasterization, our method can discard occluded primitives during rendering. Leveraging Tensor Cores for efficient computation, we integrate these neural queries directly into a novel instanced software rasterizer. Our approach outperforms the current state of the art for composed scenes in terms of VRAM usage and image quality, utilizing a combination of our instanced rasterizer and occlusion culling MLP, and exhibits complementary properties to existing LoD techniques.

Abstract: Integrating multiple personalized concepts into a single image has recently become a significant area of focus within Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. However, existing methods often underperform on complex multi-object scenes due to unintended alterations in both personalized and non-personalized regions. This not only fails to preserve the intended prompt structure but also disrupts interactions among regions, leading to semantic inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce plug-and-play multi-concept adaptive blending for high-fidelity text-to-image synthesis (PnP-MIX), an innovative, tuning-free approach designed to seamlessly embed multiple personalized concepts into a single generated image. Our method leverages guided appearance attention to faithfully reflect the intended appearance of each personalized concept. To further enhance compositional fidelity, we present a mask-guided noise mixing strategy that preserves the integrity of non-personalized regions such as the background or unrelated objects while enabling the precise integration of personalized objects. Finally, to mitigate concept leakage, i.e., the inadvertent leakage of personalized concept features into other regions, we propose background dilution++, a novel strategy that effectively reduces such leakage and promotes accurate localization of features within personalized regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PnP-MIX consistently surpasses existing methodologies in both single- and multi-concept personalization scenarios, underscoring its robustness and superior performance without additional model tuning.

Conclusion: 通过增强视频内容的基础理解，FIQ框架有效提升了VQA模型的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Conventional VQA approaches primarily rely on question-answer (Q&A) pairs to learn the spatio-temporal dynamics of video content. However, most existing annotations are event-centric, which restricts the model's ability to capture the comprehensive context of a scene. The lack of fundamental information such as object categories, spatial configurations, and descriptive visual attributes prevents the model from forming a complete understanding of the environment, ultimately limiting its generalization and reasoning capability. In this paper, we introduce Foundational Question Generation for Video Question Answering via an Embedding-Integrated Approach (FIQ), a framework designed to enhance the reasoning capability of VQA models by improving their foundational comprehension of video content. FIQ generates Q&A pairs from descriptive information extracted directly from videos, thereby enriching the dataset with core scene-level attributes. These generated pairs help the model develop a more holistic understanding of the video, leading to improved generalizability and reasoning performance. In addition, we propose a VQ-CAlign module that aligns task-specific question embeddings with corresponding visual features, preserving essential contextual cues and enhancing adaptability to downstream tasks. Experimental results on the SUTD-TrafficQA dataset demonstrate that FIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing baseline approaches.

*Qinghao Meng,Junbo Yin,Jianbing Shen,Yunde Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出角点对齐回归方法，将3D目标检测的预测目标从中心点转移到角点，解决LiDAR点云中中心点稀疏导致的不稳定问题，并支持弱监督学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云存在前表面偏向性，导致物体中心经常落在BEV视图的稀疏或空区域，造成边界框预测不准确。

Method: 设计角点感知检测头，利用角点之间的几何约束和图像2D框，从角点标注中恢复3D边界框的部分参数，实现弱监督学习。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，相比基于中心的方法AP提升3.5%，仅使用BEV角点点击即可达到全监督准确率的83%。

Conclusion: 角点感知回归策略有效解决了中心对齐回归的不稳定性问题，同时支持弱监督学习，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Center-aligned regression remains dominant in LiDAR-based 3D object detection, yet it suffers from fundamental instability: object centers often fall in sparse or empty regions of the bird's-eye-view (BEV) due to the front-surface-biased nature of LiDAR point clouds, leading to noisy and inaccurate bounding box predictions. To circumvent this limitation, we revisit bounding box representation and propose corner-aligned regression, which shifts the prediction target from unstable centers to geometrically informative corners that reside in dense, observable regions. Leveraging the inherent geometric constraints among corners and image 2D boxes, partial parameters of 3D bounding boxes can be recovered from corner annotations, enabling a weakly supervised paradigm without requiring complete 3D labels. We design a simple yet effective corner-aware detection head that can be plugged into existing detectors. Experiments on KITTI show our method improves performance by 3.5% AP over center-based baseline, and achieves 83% of fully supervised accuracy using only BEV corner clicks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our corner-aware regression strategy.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了BNN中深度卷积二值化的挑战，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了性能，为轻量级神经网络的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in model compression have highlighted the potential of low-bit precision techniques, with Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) attracting attention for their extreme efficiency. However, extreme quantization in BNNs limits representational capacity and destabilizes training, posing significant challenges for lightweight architectures with depth-wise convolutions. To address this, we propose a 1.58-bit convolution to enhance expressiveness and a pre-BN residual connection to stabilize optimization by improving the Hessian condition number. These innovations enable, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful binarization of depth-wise convolutions in BNNs. Our method achieves 33M OPs on ImageNet with MobileNet V1, establishing a new state-of-the-art in BNNs by outperforming prior methods with comparable OPs. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods across various datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, Tiny ImageNet, and Oxford Flowers 102, with accuracy improvements of up to 9.3 percentage points.

TL;DR: 提出了一种加速基于分数的扩散模型的新框架，通过将标准稳定扩散模型转换为Fokker-Planck公式，并采用跨矩阵Krylov投影方法来利用矩阵间的数学相似性，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准稳定扩散模型在转换为Fokker-Planck公式后需要为每张图像求解大型线性系统，在涉及大量图像训练时会导致高昂的计算成本，因此需要开发高效的求解方法。

Method: 将稳定扩散模型转换为Fokker-Planck公式，提出跨矩阵Krylov投影方法，利用从"种子"矩阵构建的共享子空间来快速求解后续"目标"矩阵。

Result: 实验显示该方法比标准稀疏求解器减少15.8%至43.7%的时间，在去噪任务中比DDPM基线快达115倍，在固定计算预算下能生成高质量图像而DDPM无法生成可识别内容。

Conclusion: 该方法是在资源受限环境下实现高效生成的实际可行方法，通过数学相似性利用显著提升了扩散模型的效率。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate score-based diffusion models. It first converts the standard stable diffusion model into the Fokker-Planck formulation which results in solving large linear systems for each image. For training involving many images, it can lead to a high computational cost. The core innovation is a cross-matrix Krylov projection method that exploits mathematical similarities between matrices, using a shared subspace built from ``seed" matrices to rapidly solve for subsequent ``target" matrices. Our experiments show that this technique achieves a 15.8\% to 43.7\% time reduction over standard sparse solvers. Additionally, we compare our method against DDPM baselines in denoising tasks, showing a speedup of up to 115$\times$. Furthermore, under a fixed computational budget, our model is able to produce high-quality images while DDPM fails to generate recognizable content, illustrating our approach is a practical method for efficient generation in resource-limited settings.

Conclusion: UPMI通过在元特征空间进行概率插值，有效解决了小样本多模态影像诊断问题，显著提升了小儿胰腺炎的诊断性能

Abstract: Pediatric pancreatitis is a progressive and debilitating inflammatory condition, including acute pancreatitis and chronic pancreatitis, that presents significant clinical diagnostic challenges. Machine learning-based methods also face diagnostic challenges due to limited sample availability and multimodal imaging complexity. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Upstream Probabilistic Meta-Imputation (UPMI), a light-weight augmentation strategy that operates upstream of a meta-learner in a low-dimensional meta-feature space rather than in image space. Modality-specific logistic regressions (T1W and T2W MRI radiomics) produce probability outputs that are transformed into a 7-dimensional meta-feature vector. Class-conditional Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are then fit within each cross-validation fold to sample synthetic meta-features that, combined with real meta-features, train a Random Forest (RF) meta-classifier. On 67 pediatric subjects with paired T1W/T2W MRIs, UPMI achieves a mean AUC of 0.908 $\pm$ 0.072, a $\sim$5% relative gain over a real-only baseline (AUC 0.864 $\pm$ 0.061).

Method: 提出基于可区分性和活跃度的典型集精炼方法，将激活修正为通道感知的典型集，并引入偏度精炼来缓解典型集估计中的分布偏差，最后使用修正后的激活计算能量得分进行OOD检测。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K和CIFAR-100基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，并在不同骨干网络和得分函数上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过通道感知的典型集精炼和偏度校正，有效改进了OOD检测性能，证明了其在缓解分布偏差和提升检测准确性方面的有效性。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is a critical capability for ensuring the safe deployment of machine learning models in open-world environments, where unexpected or anomalous inputs can compromise model reliability and performance. Activation-based methods play a fundamental role in OOD detection by mitigating anomalous activations and enhancing the separation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD data. However, existing methods apply activation rectification while often overlooking channel's intrinsic characteristics and distributional skewness, which results in inaccurate typical set estimation. This discrepancy can lead to the improper inclusion of anomalous activations across channels. To address this limitation, we propose a typical set refinement method based on discriminability and activity, which rectifies activations into a channel-aware typical set. Furthermore, we introduce a skewness-based refinement to mitigate distributional bias in typical set estimation. Finally, we leverage the rectified activations to compute the energy score for OOD detection. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K and CIFAR-100 benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and generalizes effectively across backbones and score functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少测试在具体环境中的接地、部分可观察性和事后验证能力，而现实世界中的物理控制界面交互需要常识推理、物理推理以及时空因果预测。

Method: 通过迭代发布创建SWITCH基准测试，第一版SWITCH-Basic包含351个任务，涵盖98种真实设备，使用第一人称RGB视频输入评估五个互补能力。

Result: 商业和开源LMM在单步交互中表现不一致，过度依赖文本线索而未能充分利用视觉或视频证据，高聚合分数可能掩盖这些失败。

Conclusion: SWITCH提供了数据、代码和保留集，支持可重复评估和社区贡献，以推动更具挑战性的基准测试迭代和训练数据集的创建。

Abstract: Autonomous intelligence requires not only perception and reasoning, but critically, effective interaction with the existing world and its infrastructure. Everyday environments are rich in tangible control interfaces (TCIs), e.g., light switches, appliance panels, and embedded GUIs, that demand commonsense and physics reasoning, but also causal prediction and outcome verification in time and space (e.g., delayed heating, remote lights). Moreover, failures here have potential safety implications, yet current benchmarks rarely test grounding, partial observability (video), or post-hoc verification in situated settings. We introduce SWITCH (Semantic World Interface Tasks for Control and Handling), an embodied, task-driven benchmark created through iterative releases to probe these gaps. Its first iteration, SWITCH-Basic, evaluates five complementary abilities:task-aware VQA, semantic UI grounding, action generation, state-transition prediction, and result verification, under egocentric RGB video input and device diversity. Across 351 tasks spanning 98 real devices and appliances, commercial and open LMMMs exhibit inconsistent performance even on single-step interactions, often over-relying on textual cues and under-using visual or video evidence (and high aggregate scores can mask such failures). SWITCH provides data, code, and held-out splits to enable reproducible evaluation and community contributions toward more challenging future iterations of the benchmark and the creation of training datasets.

Conclusion: MedPEFT-CL框架通过参数高效的持续学习方法，有效解决了医学视觉语言分割中的灾难性遗忘问题，为临床部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language segmentation models suffer from catastrophic forgetting when adapting to new anatomical structures, requiring complete retraining that limits their clinical deployment. Although continual learning approaches have been studied for various applications, targeted research on continual learning approaches specifically designed for medical vision-language tasks remains underexplored. We propose MedPEFT-CL, a parameter-efficient continual learning framework that addresses both efficient learning of new tasks and preservation of previous knowledge through a dual-phase architecture based on CLIPSeg. Our dual-phase architecture features an adaptive learning phase that employs semantic similarity-based adapter allocation and parameter-efficient fine-tuning for medical tasks through prompt similarity analysis, and a knowledge consolidation phase employing bi-directional Fisher-memory coordination. This creates a reinforcing cycle: consolidation directs replay priorities while new tasks provide challenging samples that improve retention strategies. Our key contributions are: (1) a semantic-driven adapter allocation mechanism that enables efficient learning of new medical tasks, (2) a bi-modal LoRA adaptation that significantly reduces trainable parameters while maintaining cross-modal learning, and (3) bidirectional Fisher-memory coordination that prevents catastrophic forgetting from previous medical tasks. Extensive experiments across diverse medical datasets demonstrate superior forgetting mitigation and performance retention with minimal parameter overhead, making the framework effective for continual learning in medical vision-language scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了VMRMOT框架，通过引入运动模态来增强视觉模态与语言参考之间的对齐，解决RMOT中静态参考无法捕捉对象运动动态变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RMOT基准仅描述对象的外观、相对位置和初始运动状态，这种静态调节无法捕捉对象运动的动态变化（如速度变化和运动方向转变），导致静态参考与动态视觉模态之间的时间差异，限制了多模态跟踪性能。

Method: 提出VMRMOT框架：1）从对象动态行为中提取运动感知描述，利用MLLMs的强大时序推理能力提取运动特征作为运动模态；2）设计视觉-运动-参考对齐模块分层对齐视觉查询与运动和参考线索；3）开发运动引导预测头探索运动模态以增强预测头性能。

Result: 在多个RMOT基准上的广泛实验表明，VMRMOT优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: VMRMOT是首个在RMOT任务中采用MLLMs进行视觉-参考对齐的方法，通过整合运动模态有效解决了静态参考与动态视觉之间的不对齐问题。

Abstract: Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) extends conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) by introducing natural language references for multi-modal fusion tracking. RMOT benchmarks only describe the object's appearance, relative positions, and initial motion states. This so-called static regulation fails to capture dynamic changes of the object motion, including velocity changes and motion direction shifts. This limitation not only causes a temporal discrepancy between static references and dynamic vision modality but also constrains multi-modal tracking performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Vision-Motion-Reference aligned RMOT framework, named VMRMOT. It integrates a motion modality extracted from object dynamics to enhance the alignment between vision modality and language references through multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we introduce motion-aware descriptions derived from object dynamic behaviors and, leveraging the powerful temporal-reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, extract motion features as the motion modality. We further design a Vision-Motion-Reference Alignment (VMRA) module to hierarchically align visual queries with motion and reference cues, enhancing their cross-modal consistency. In addition, a Motion-Guided Prediction Head (MGPH) is developed to explore motion modality to enhance the performance of the prediction head. To the best of our knowledge, VMRMOT is the first approach to employ MLLMs in the RMOT task for vision-reference alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple RMOT benchmarks demonstrate that VMRMOT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型和视觉语言模型如何表示和计算数值信息，特别是在计数任务中的工作机制。

Method: 使用重复文本和视觉项目的受控实验，通过因果干预和激活修补分析模型行为，并开发了CountScope工具进行机制可解释性分析。

Result: 发现单个token或视觉特征编码潜在位置计数信息，数值表示在层级中逐步出现，识别出内部计数器机制，视觉模型中数值信息出现在视觉嵌入中并随空间构成变化。

Conclusion: 计数在LLM和LVLM中表现为结构化的层级过程，受到文本分隔符等结构线索的影响，视觉编码器的特性也塑造了LVLM中的计数模式。

Abstract: This paper examines how large language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) represent and compute numerical information in counting tasks. We use controlled experiments with repeated textual and visual items and analyze model behavior through causal mediation and activation patching. To this end, we design a specialized tool, CountScope, for mechanistic interpretability of numerical content. Results show that individual tokens or visual features encode latent positional count information that can be extracted and transferred across contexts. Layerwise analyses reveal a progressive emergence of numerical representations, with lower layers encoding small counts and higher layers representing larger ones. We identify an internal counter mechanism that updates with each item, stored mainly in the final token or region and transferable between contexts. In LVLMs, numerical information also appears in visual embeddings, shifting between background and foreground regions depending on spatial composition. Models rely on structural cues such as separators in text, which act as shortcuts for tracking item counts and influence the accuracy of numerical predictions. Overall, counting emerges as a structured, layerwise process in LLMs and follows the same general pattern in LVLMs, shaped by the properties of the vision encoder.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在回答图像视觉属性查询时常常依赖训练中学到的固有偏见，特别是在需要关注图像特定区域的计数任务中，这些偏见会被放大。

Method: 构建合成基准数据集和评估框架，使用开源VLM分析注意力分配如何随输入参数变化，并实施基于注意力的干预来调节不同层的视觉标记焦点。

Result: 实验表明VLM计数性能仍然具有挑战性，特别是在高视觉或语言复杂度条件下，但某些注意力干预可以在计数性能上带来适度提升。

Conclusion: 虽然VLM在复杂条件下的计数任务表现仍不理想，但注意力干预策略为改善其性能提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent research suggests that Vision Language Models (VLMs) often rely on inherent biases learned during training when responding to queries about visual properties of images. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly specific questions that require them to focus on particular areas of the image in tasks such as counting. We build upon this research by developing a synthetic benchmark dataset and evaluation framework to systematically determine how counting performance varies as image and prompt properties change. Using open-source VLMs, we then analyze how attention allocation fluctuates with varying input parameters (e.g. number of objects in the image, objects color, background color, objects texture, background texture, and prompt specificity). We further implement attention-based interventions to modulate focus on visual tokens at different layers and evaluate their impact on counting performance across a range of visual conditions. Our experiments reveal that while VLM counting performance remains challenging, especially under high visual or linguistic complexity, certain attention interventions can lead to modest gains in counting performance.

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，XCA是实时心脏介入的金标准。血管分割有助于下游定量评估，但由于成像协议和患者差异导致的域偏移，以及标注数据缺乏，使得单源域泛化成为必要解决方案。

Method: 提出AngioDG方法，采用通道正则化策略：识别早期特征通道对任务特定指标的贡献，然后重新加权通道以校准和放大域不变特征，同时减弱域特定特征。

Result: 在6个X射线血管造影数据集上评估，相比其他方法取得了最佳的外域分布性能，同时保持了稳定的域内测试性能。

Conclusion: AngioDG方法通过通道正则化有效解决了XCA血管分割中的单源域泛化问题，提高了模型在未见域上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, with X-ray Coronary Angiography (XCA) as the gold standard during real-time cardiac interventions. Segmentation of coronary vessels from XCA can facilitate downstream quantitative assessments, such as measurement of the stenosis severity and enhancing clinical decision-making. However, developing generalizable vessel segmentation models for XCA is challenging due to variations in imaging protocols and patient demographics that cause domain shifts. These limitations are exacerbated by the lack of annotated datasets, making Single-source Domain Generalization (SDG) a necessary solution for achieving generalization. Existing SDG methods are largely augmentation-based, which may not guarantee the mitigation of overfitting to augmented or synthetic domains. We propose a novel approach, ``AngioDG", to bridge this gap by channel regularization strategy to promote generalization. Our method identifies the contributions of early feature channels to task-specific metrics for DG, facilitating interpretability, and then reweights channels to calibrate and amplify domain-invariant features while attenuating domain-specific ones. We evaluate AngioDG on 6 x-ray angiography datasets for coronary vessels segmentation, achieving the best out-of-distribution performance among the compared methods, while maintaining consistent in-domain test performance.

TL;DR: VLMs在卒中康复视频分析中表现有限：剂量估计与无视觉信息的基线相当，损伤评分无法可靠预测，但通过优化提示和后期处理，可在无任务特定训练的情况下实现高层活动分类、动作检测和轻度受损患者的剂量估算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在数字健康领域的应用潜力，特别是解决卒中康复中的两个核心挑战：从视频中自动量化康复剂量和损伤程度。

Method: 将康复剂量和损伤量化问题构建为运动识别任务，使用VLMs处理，在29名健康对照和51名卒中幸存者队列上评估，采用优化提示和后期处理策略。

Result: 当前VLMs缺乏精细运动理解能力：剂量估计与排除视觉信息的基线相当，损伤评分无法可靠预测；但能分类高层活动、检测动作和抓握，对轻度受损和健康参与者的剂量计数误差在25%以内。

Conclusion: VLMs在数据驱动的卒中康复和临床视频分析中既存在当前局限性，也展现出未来应用前景，需要进一步改进精细运动理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of computer-vision tasks, sparking interest in their potential for digital health applications. Here, we apply VLMs to two fundamental challenges in data-driven stroke rehabilitation: automatic quantification of rehabilitation dose and impairment from videos. We formulate these problems as motion-identification tasks, which can be addressed using VLMs. We evaluate our proposed framework on a cohort of 29 healthy controls and 51 stroke survivors. Our results show that current VLMs lack the fine-grained motion understanding required for precise quantification: dose estimates are comparable to a baseline that excludes visual information, and impairment scores cannot be reliably predicted. Nevertheless, several findings suggest future promise. With optimized prompting and post-processing, VLMs can classify high-level activities from a few frames, detect motion and grasp with moderate accuracy, and approximate dose counts within 25% of ground truth for mildly impaired and healthy participants, all without task-specific training or finetuning. These results highlight both the current limitations and emerging opportunities of VLMs for data-driven stroke rehabilitation and broader clinical video analysis.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven remarkably effective for eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its potential in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remains largely untapped, hindered by the absence of large-scale datasets that capture the rich, spatially grounded reasoning intrinsic to visual understanding. Existing visual-CoT resources are typically small, domain-specific, or lack the human-like stepwise structure necessary for compositional visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisReason, a large-scale dataset designed to advance visual Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VisReason comprises 489K annotated examples spanning four diverse domains, each featuring multi-round, human-like rationales that guide MLLMs through interpretable visual reasoning steps. Building upon this, we curate VisReason-Pro, a 165K subset produced with a stronger expert-level GPT annotator, enriched with detailed reasoning traces and 3D spatial grounding via depth-informed annotations. Fine-tuning the state-of-the-art Qwen2.5-VL model on VisReason and VisReason-Pro yields substantial improvements in step-by-step visual reasoning accuracy, interpretability, and cross-benchmark generalization. These results demonstrate that VisReason equips MLLMs with more systematic and generalizable reasoning capabilities. We envision VisReason as a cornerstone for cultivating human-like visual reasoning, paving the way toward the next generation of multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Scientific archives now contain hundreds of petabytes of data across genomics, ecology, climate, and molecular biology that could reveal undiscovered patterns if systematically analyzed at scale. Large-scale, weakly-supervised datasets in language and vision have driven the development of foundation models whose internal representations encode structure (patterns, co-occurrences and statistical regularities) beyond their training objectives. Most existing methods extract structure only for pre-specified targets; they excel at confirmation but do not support open-ended discovery of unknown patterns. We ask whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) can enable open-ended feature discovery from foundation model representations. We evaluate this question in controlled rediscovery studies, where the learned SAE features are tested for alignment with semantic concepts on a standard segmentation benchmark and compared against strong label-free alternatives on concept-alignment metrics. Applied to ecological imagery, the same procedure surfaces fine-grained anatomical structure without access to segmentation or part labels, providing a scientific case study with ground-truth validation. While our experiments focus on vision with an ecology case study, the method is domain-agnostic and applicable to models in other sciences (e.g., proteins, genomics, weather). Our results indicate that sparse decomposition provides a practical instrument for exploring what scientific foundation models have learned, an important prerequisite for moving from confirmation to genuine discovery.

Motivation: 随着照片级真实感3D面部化身的广泛采用，特别是使用高效3D高斯溅射表示的系统，带来了在线身份盗用的新风险。现有方法主要针对2D图像，缺乏对动态3D化身的鲁棒、视角一致的身份保护。

Method: AEGIS通过预训练的人脸验证网络引导，对高斯颜色系数施加对抗性扰动，确保在多视角下的一致保护，无需重新训练或修改化身的几何结构。

Result: AEGIS实现了完全去识别化，将人脸检索和验证准确率降至0%，同时保持高感知质量（SSIM = 0.9555，PSNR = 35.52 dB），并保留了年龄、种族、性别和情感等关键面部属性。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了强大的隐私保护能力，同时产生最小的视觉失真，为3D高斯化身提供了有效的身份保护解决方案。

Abstract: The growing adoption of photorealistic 3D facial avatars, particularly those utilizing efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, introduces new risks of online identity theft, especially in systems that rely on biometric authentication. While effective adversarial masking methods have been developed for 2D images, a significant gap remains in achieving robust, viewpoint-consistent identity protection for dynamic 3D avatars. To address this, we present AEGIS, the first privacy-preserving identity masking framework for 3D Gaussian Avatars that maintains the subject's perceived characteristics. Our method aims to conceal identity-related facial features while preserving the avatar's perceptual realism and functional integrity. AEGIS applies adversarial perturbations to the Gaussian color coefficients, guided by a pre-trained face verification network, ensuring consistent protection across multiple viewpoints without retraining or modifying the avatar's geometry. AEGIS achieves complete de-identification, reducing face retrieval and verification accuracy to 0%, while maintaining high perceptual quality (SSIM = 0.9555, PSNR = 35.52 dB). It also preserves key facial attributes such as age, race, gender, and emotion, demonstrating strong privacy protection with minimal visual distortion.

Conclusion: SPIDER框架通过整合2D和3D特征匹配方法，有效解决了跨域图像匹配中的挑战，特别是在大视角变化下的细粒度几何细节匹配问题。

Abstract: Reliable image correspondences form the foundation of vision-based spatial perception, enabling recovery of 3D structure and camera poses. However, unconstrained feature matching across domains such as aerial, indoor, and outdoor scenes remains challenging due to large variations in appearance, scale and viewpoint. Feature matching has been conventionally formulated as a 2D-to-2D problem; however, recent 3D foundation models provides spatial feature matching properties based on two-view geometry. While powerful, we observe that these spatially coherent matches often concentrate on dominant planar regions, e.g., walls or ground surfaces, while being less sensitive to fine-grained geometric details, particularly under large viewpoint changes. To better understand these trade-offs, we first perform linear probe experiments to evaluate the performance of various vision foundation models for image matching. Building on these insights, we introduce SPIDER, a universal feature matching framework that integrates a shared feature extraction backbone with two specialized network heads for estimating both 2D-based and 3D-based correspondences from coarse to fine. Finally, we introduce an image-matching evaluation benchmark that focuses on unconstrained scenarios with large baselines. SPIDER significantly outperforms SoTA methods, demonstrating its strong ability as a universal image-matching method.

Motivation: 现有方法需要大量高质量像素标注和语言监督，成本高昂且泛化能力有限，需要解决在分布偏移下的脆弱性能问题。

Method: 1) 条件视觉指令编码对象间空间和上下文关系；2) 基于多模态LLM在语义等价查询中输出一致性的噪声伪标签过滤；3) 标注和伪标注样本间的token级对比对齐增强特征一致性。

Conclusion: CORA框架能够在最小监督下实现鲁棒的推理分割，显著优于现有基线方法。

Abstract: Reasoning segmentation seeks pixel-accurate masks for targets referenced by complex, often implicit instructions, requiring context-dependent reasoning over the scene. Recent multimodal language models have advanced instruction following segmentation, yet generalization remains limited. The key bottleneck is the high cost of curating diverse, high-quality pixel annotations paired with rich linguistic supervision leading to brittle performance under distribution shift. Therefore, we present CORA, a semi-supervised reasoning segmentation framework that jointly learns from limited labeled data and a large corpus of unlabeled images. CORA introduces three main components: 1) conditional visual instructions that encode spatial and contextual relationships between objects; 2) a noisy pseudo-label filter based on the consistency of Multimodal LLM's outputs across semantically equivalent queries; and 3) a token-level contrastive alignment between labeled and pseudo-labeled samples to enhance feature consistency. These components enable CORA to perform robust reasoning segmentation with minimal supervision, outperforming existing baselines under constrained annotation settings. CORA achieves state-of-the-art results, requiring as few as 100 labeled images on Cityscapes, a benchmark dataset for urban scene understanding, surpassing the baseline by $+2.3\%$. Similarly, CORA improves performance by $+2.4\%$ with only 180 labeled images on PanNuke, a histopathology dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像虽然能捕获丰富的光谱信息用于材料识别，但光谱混合常常掩盖纯材料特征，需要开发能够处理这种混合并保持物理可解释性的方法。

Method: LDVAE-T模型结合Transformer架构和狄利克雷先验，将材料视为捆绑端元，解码器为每个端元和每个补丁预测均值光谱和结构化协方差，编码器通过Transformer获取狄利克雷分布的丰度。

Result: 在Samson、Jasper Ridge和HYDICE Urban三个基准数据集上，LDVAE-T在丰度估计（RMSE）和端元提取（SAD）方面均优于现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: LDVAE-T通过结合Transformer的全局建模能力和狄利克雷先验的物理约束，成功实现了高光谱解混，能够表示内在材料变异性同时保持物理可解释性。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images capture rich spectral information that enables per-pixel material identification; however, spectral mixing often obscures pure material signatures. To address this challenge, we propose the Latent Dirichlet Transformer Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE-T) for hyperspectral unmixing. Our model combines the global context modeling capabilities of transformer architectures with physically meaningful constraints imposed by a Dirichlet prior in the latent space. This prior naturally enforces the sum-to-one and non-negativity conditions essential for abundance estimation, thereby improving the quality of predicted mixing ratios. A key contribution of LDVAE-T is its treatment of materials as bundled endmembers, rather than relying on fixed ground truth spectra. In the proposed method our decoder predicts, for each endmember and each patch, a mean spectrum together with a structured (segmentwise) covariance that captures correlated spectral variability. Reconstructions are formed by mixing these learned bundles with Dirichlet-distributed abundances garnered from a transformer encoder, allowing the model to represent intrinsic material variability while preserving physical interpretability. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, Samson, Jasper Ridge, and HYDICE Urban and show that LDVAE-T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in abundance estimation and endmember extraction, as measured by root mean squared error and spectral angle distance, respectively.

Conclusion: ViT在卫星图像深度伪造检测中表现出优越性能，未来工作将扩展到多光谱和SAR模态，并集成频域分析以进一步加强检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models such as StyleGAN2 and Stable Diffusion poses a growing threat to the authenticity of satellite imagery, which is increasingly vital for reliable analysis and decision-making across scientific and security domains. While deepfake detection has been extensively studied in facial contexts, satellite imagery presents distinct challenges, including terrain-level inconsistencies and structural artifacts. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive comparison between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) for detecting AI-generated satellite images. Using a curated dataset of over 130,000 labeled RGB images from the DM-AER and FSI datasets, we show that ViTs significantly outperform CNNs in both accuracy (95.11 percent vs. 87.02 percent) and overall robustness, owing to their ability to model long-range dependencies and global semantic structures. We further enhance model transparency using architecture-specific interpretability methods, including Grad-CAM for CNNs and Chefer's attention attribution for ViTs, revealing distinct detection behaviors and validating model trustworthiness. Our results highlight the ViT's superior performance in detecting structural inconsistencies and repetitive textural patterns characteristic of synthetic imagery. Future work will extend this research to multispectral and SAR modalities and integrate frequency-domain analysis to further strengthen detection capabilities and safeguard satellite imagery integrity in high-stakes applications.

Motivation: 虽然当前世界模型能生成高度逼真的视频，但它们在机器人路径规划方面的能力尚不明确且缺乏量化评估。需要专门的基准来评估世界模型在真实环境中向语义目标进行无地图路径规划的能力。

Method: 创建Target-Bench基准，包含450个机器人收集的视频序列，覆盖45个语义类别，带有SLAM生成的真实轨迹。通过从生成视频中恢复相机运动，使用五个互补指标来量化目标到达能力、轨迹精度和方向一致性。评估了Sora 2、Veo 3.1和Wan系列等最先进模型。

Result: 最佳现成模型(Wan2.2-Flash)仅获得0.299总分，显示当前世界模型在机器人规划任务中存在显著局限性。通过在数据集上微调一个开源的50亿参数模型，仅使用325个场景就达到0.345总分，比基础版本(0.066)提升超过400%，比最佳现成模型高出15%。

Abstract: While recent world models generate highly realistic videos, their ability to perform robot path planning remains unclear and unquantified. We introduce Target-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate world models on mapless path planning toward semantic targets in real-world environments. Target-Bench provides 450 robot-collected video sequences spanning 45 semantic categories with SLAM-based ground truth trajectories. Our evaluation pipeline recovers camera motion from generated videos and measures planning performance using five complementary metrics that quantify target-reaching capability, trajectory accuracy, and directional consistency. We evaluate state-of-the-art models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, and the Wan series. The best off-the-shelf model (Wan2.2-Flash) achieves only 0.299 overall score, revealing significant limitations in current world models for robotic planning tasks. We show that fine-tuning an open-source 5B-parameter model on only 325 scenarios from our dataset achieves 0.345 overall score -- an improvement of more than 400% over its base version (0.066) and 15% higher than the best off-the-shelf model.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) rely on effective multimodal alignment between pre-trained vision encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate visual and textual information. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of attention patterns in efficient VLMs, revealing that concatenation-based architectures frequently fail to distinguish between semantically matching and non-matching image-text pairs. This is a key factor for object hallucination in these models. To address this, we introduce Attention-Guided Efficient Vision-Language Models (AGE-VLM), a novel framework that enhances visual grounding through interleaved cross-attention layers to instill vision capabilities in pretrained small language models. This enforces in VLM the ability "look" at the correct image regions by leveraging spatial knowledge distilled from the Segment Anything Model (SAM), significantly reducing hallucination. We validate our approach across different vision-centric benchmarks where our method is better or comparable to prior work on efficient VLMs. Our findings provide valuable insights for future research aimed at achieving enhanced visual and linguistic understanding in VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代医学中放射学工作量激增但人力资源不足，现有医学模型处理3D医学图像时存在限制：将体积CT和MRI处理为低保真2D切片、丢弃关键灰度对比信息、缺乏反映真实临床实践的评价框架。

Method: 开发Pillar-0放射学基础模型，在大量CT和MRI数据上预训练；创建RATE框架，使用LLM以近乎完美的准确率提取366个放射学发现的结构化标签。

Result: Pillar-0在内部测试集上平均AUROC达到86.4-90.1，比MedGemma、MedImageInsight等模型高出7.8-15.8 AUROC点，在87.2%的任务中排名第一；在外部验证中同样优于所有基线模型；在肺癌风险预测和脑出血检测等任务中也表现出色。

Conclusion: Pillar-0和RATE共同提供了一个开放、临床严谨的基础，用于构建高性能放射学系统，使之前因计算、数据和评估限制而不可行的应用成为可能。

Abstract: Radiology plays an integral role in modern medicine, yet rising imaging volumes have far outpaced workforce growth. Foundation models offer a path toward assisting with the full spectrum of radiology tasks, but existing medical models remain limited: they process volumetric CT and MRI as low-fidelity 2D slices, discard critical grayscale contrast information, and lack evaluation frameworks that reflect real clinical practice. We introduce Pillar-0, a radiology foundation model pretrained on 42,990 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 86,411 chest CTs, 14,348 head CTs, and 11,543 breast MRIs from a large academic center, together with RATE, a scalable framework that extracts structured labels for 366 radiologic findings with near-perfect accuracy using LLMs. Across internal test sets of 14,230 abdomen-pelvis CTs, 10,646 chest CTs, 4,906 head CTs, and 1,585 breast MRIs, Pillar-0 establishes a new performance frontier, achieving mean AUROCs of 86.4, 88.0, 90.1, and 82.9, outperforming MedGemma (Google), MedImageInsight (Microsoft), Lingshu (Alibaba), and Merlin (Stanford) by 7.8-15.8 AUROC points and ranking best in 87.2\% (319/366) tasks. Pillar-0 similarly outperforms all baselines in an external validation on the Stanford Abdominal CT dataset, including Merlin (82.2 vs 80.6 AUROC). Pillar-0 extends to tasks beyond its pretraining, such as long-horizon lung cancer risk prediction, where it improves upon the state-of-the-art Sybil by 3.0 C-index points on NLST, and generalizes with gains of 5.9 (MGH) and 1.9 (CGMH). In brain hemorrhage detection, Pillar-0 obtained a >95 AUROC when using only 1/20th of the data of the next most sample efficient baseline. Pillar-0 and RATE together provide an open, clinically rigorous foundation for building high-performance radiology systems, enabling applications that were previously infeasible due to computational, data, and evaluation constraints.

TL;DR: PL-Stitch是一个自监督学习框架，通过利用视频帧的固有时间顺序作为监督信号，解决现有方法对程序性活动时序结构缺乏感知的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在静态图像和短视频上表现良好，但忽略了程序性活动（如手术操作）具有特定时间顺序的结构化特性。实验表明，当前方法对正向和反向时间序列产生的特征高度相似，证明其表示对程序性顺序是盲目的。

Method: 提出PL-Stitch框架，基于Plackett-Luce模型集成两个概率目标：主要PL目标训练模型按时间顺序对采样帧进行排序，学习全局工作流程进展；次要目标通过时空拼图损失捕捉细粒度的跨帧对象相关性。

Result: 在五个手术和烹饪基准测试中持续实现卓越性能，特别是在手术阶段识别（如Cholec80上k-NN准确率提升11.4个百分点）和烹饪动作分割（如Breakfast上线性探测准确率提升5.7个百分点）方面取得显著增益。

Conclusion: PL-Stitch通过利用程序性视频的时间顺序作为监督信号，有效提升了程序性视频表示学习的效果，证明了时间顺序感知在程序性活动理解中的重要性。

Abstract: Procedural activities, ranging from routine cooking to complex surgical operations, are highly structured as a set of actions conducted in a specific temporal order. Despite their success on static images and short clips, current self-supervised learning methods often overlook the procedural nature that underpins such activities. We expose the lack of procedural awareness in current SSL methods with a motivating experiment: models pretrained on forward and time-reversed sequences produce highly similar features, confirming that their representations are blind to the underlying procedural order. To address this shortcoming, we propose PL-Stitch, a self-supervised framework that harnesses the inherent temporal order of video frames as a powerful supervisory signal. Our approach integrates two novel probabilistic objectives based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model. The primary PL objective trains the model to sort sampled frames chronologically, compelling it to learn the global workflow progression. The secondary objective, a spatio-temporal jigsaw loss, complements the learning by capturing fine-grained, cross-frame object correlations. Our approach consistently achieves superior performance across five surgical and cooking benchmarks. Specifically, PL-Stitch yields significant gains in surgical phase recognition (e.g., +11.4 pp k-NN accuracy on Cholec80) and cooking action segmentation (e.g., +5.7 pp linear probing accuracy on Breakfast), demonstrating its effectiveness for procedural video representation learning.

Method: 将DiffusionDet的2D边界框扩散过程提升到3D雷达空间，利用噪声3D边界框指导显式的跨视角雷达特征关联，并结合人与地面接触的先验知识减少扩散参数。

Result: 在两个公开室内雷达数据集上，HIBER数据集AP提升4.22，MMVR数据集AP提升11.02，超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: REXO通过3D边界框扩散和显式特征关联有效解决了多视角雷达感知中的特征匹配问题，显著提升了检测精度。

Abstract: Multi-view indoor radar perception has drawn attention due to its cost-effectiveness and low privacy risks. Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配模型能有效表示复杂分布，但在有限采样预算下估计其输出的函数期望具有挑战性。独立采样通常产生高方差估计，特别是当罕见但高影响结果主导期望时。

Method: 引入重要性加权的非独立同分布采样框架，联合抽取多个样本覆盖分布的多样化重要区域；提出基于分数的正则化机制，使用分数函数确保样本在高密度区域内分散；开发了学习残差速度场的方法来估计非独立同分布样本的重要性权重。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重要性加权的非独立同分布采样框架，显著改善了流匹配模型在有限采样预算下的期望估计准确性，为可靠表征模型输出提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Flow-matching models effectively represent complex distributions, yet estimating expectations of functions of their outputs remains challenging under limited sampling budgets. Independent sampling often yields high-variance estimates, especially when rare but with high-impact outcomes dominate the expectation. We propose an importance-weighted non-IID sampling framework that jointly draws multiple samples to cover diverse, salient regions of a flow's distribution while maintaining unbiased estimation via estimated importance weights. To balance diversity and quality, we introduce a score-based regularization for the diversity mechanism, which uses the score function, i.e., the gradient of the log probability, to ensure samples are pushed apart within high-density regions of the data manifold, mitigating off-manifold drift. We further develop the first approach for importance weighting of non-IID flow samples by learning a residual velocity field that reproduces the marginal distribution of the non-IID samples. Empirically, our method produces diverse, high-quality samples and accurate estimates of both importance weights and expectations, advancing the reliable characterization of flow-matching model outputs. Our code will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出Quality-Aware Loss (QAL)作为Chamfer Distance和Earth Mover's Distance的替代方案，通过解耦召回率和精确度来改进3D体积学习的训练目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D体积学习训练目标（CD和EMD）无法平衡召回率和精确度，导致薄结构和欠表示区域被忽略，影响3D视觉任务的性能。

Method: QAL结合了覆盖加权的最近邻项和未覆盖真实值吸引项，将召回率和精确度显式解耦为可调组件。

Result: 在多样化流程中，QAL平均比CD提升4.3个百分点，比最佳替代方案提升2.8个百分点，能可靠恢复薄结构和欠表示区域，并在GraspNet评估中获得更高的抓取分数。

Conclusion: QAL为稳健的3D视觉和安全关键机器人流程提供了原则性、可解释且实用的训练目标。

Abstract: Volumetric learning underpins many 3D vision tasks such as completion, reconstruction, and mesh generation, yet training objectives still rely on Chamfer Distance (CD) or Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), which fail to balance recall and precision. We propose Quality-Aware Loss (QAL), a drop-in replacement for CD/EMD that combines a coverage-weighted nearest-neighbor term with an uncovered-ground-truth attraction term, explicitly decoupling recall and precision into tunable components.
  Across diverse pipelines, QAL achieves consistent coverage gains, improving by an average of +4.3 pts over CD and +2.8 pts over the best alternatives. Though modest in percentage, these improvements reliably recover thin structures and under-represented regions that CD/EMD overlook. Extensive ablations confirm stable performance across hyperparameters and across output resolutions, while full retraining on PCN and ShapeNet demonstrates generalization across datasets and backbones. Moreover, QAL-trained completions yield higher grasp scores under GraspNet evaluation, showing that improved coverage translates directly into more reliable robotic manipulation.
  QAL thus offers a principled, interpretable, and practical objective for robust 3D vision and safety-critical robotics pipelines

Abstract: Foundation models hold promise for specialized medical imaging tasks, though their effectiveness in breast imaging remains underexplored. This study leverages BiomedCLIP as a foundation model to address challenges in model generalization. BiomedCLIP was adapted for automated BI-RADS breast density classification using multi-modality mammographic data (synthesized 2D images, digital mammography, and digital breast tomosynthesis). Using 96,995 images, we compared single-modality (s2D only) and multi-modality training approaches, addressing class imbalance through weighted contrastive learning. Both approaches achieved similar accuracy (multi-modality: 0.74, single-modality: 0.73), with the multi-modality model offering broader applicability across different imaging modalities and higher AUC values consistently above 0.84 across BI-RADS categories. External validation on the RSNA and EMBED datasets showed strong generalization capabilities (AUC range: 0.80-0.93). GradCAM visualizations confirmed consistent and clinically relevant attention patterns, highlighting the models interpretability and robustness. This research underscores the potential of foundation models for breast imaging applications, paving the way for future extensions for diagnostic tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将文本引导图像编辑和视频预测视为独立任务，导致图像编辑方法忽略动作的时间展开，而视频预测模型忽视预期结果。需要统一框架来解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出ShowMe框架，选择性激活视频扩散模型的空间和时间组件，并引入结构和运动一致性奖励来提升结构保真度和时间连贯性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在指令图像和视频生成方面优于专家模型，展示了视频扩散模型作为统一动作-状态转换器的优势。

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型可以作为统一的动作-状态转换器，通过空间和时间组件的选择性激活，在图像编辑和视频预测任务中实现协同增强。

Abstract: Generating visual instructions in a given context is essential for developing interactive world simulators. While prior works address this problem through either text-guided image manipulation or video prediction, these tasks are typically treated in isolation. This separation reveals a fundamental issue: image manipulation methods overlook how actions unfold over time, while video prediction models often ignore the intended outcomes. To this end, we propose ShowMe, a unified framework that enables both tasks by selectively activating the spatial and temporal components of video diffusion models. In addition, we introduce structure and motion consistency rewards to improve structural fidelity and temporal coherence. Notably, this unification brings dual benefits: the spatial knowledge gained through video pretraining enhances contextual consistency and realism in non-rigid image edits, while the instruction-guided manipulation stage equips the model with stronger goal-oriented reasoning for video prediction. Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms expert models in both instructional image and video generation, highlighting the strength of video diffusion models as a unified action-object state transformer.

Motivation: 解决多智能体协同感知中通信带宽有限的问题，现有方法未考虑语义相关性和跨智能体冗余，需要最大化每个传输比特对感知任务的贡献。

Method: 使用正则化编码器提取语义相关稀疏特征，轻量级特征效用估计器预测特征贡献度，交换元效用图并计算最优传输策略，选择每个位置效用最高的特征。

Conclusion: JigsawComm通过语义感知的特征选择和传输策略，实现了通信高效的协同感知，随着智能体数量增加保持O(1)通信成本。

Abstract: Multi-agent cooperative perception (CP) promises to overcome the inherent occlusion and sensing-range limitations of single-agent systems (e.g., autonomous driving). However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases. On the benchmarks OPV2V and DAIR-V2X, JigsawComm reduces the total data volume by up to $>$500$\times$ while achieving matching or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量高质量数据集来精调文本到视频扩散模型以添加物理相机参数控制，但这类数据难以获取。

Method: 使用稀疏、低质量的合成数据进行精调，而非依赖真实数据。

Result: 使用简单合成数据精调不仅能实现所需控制，而且效果优于使用真实数据精调的模型。

Conclusion: 提供了一种直观和定量的框架来解释这一现象，证明了数据高效精调策略的有效性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large-scale text-to-video diffusion models to add new generative controls, such as those over physical camera parameters (e.g., shutter speed or aperture), typically requires vast, high-fidelity datasets that are difficult to acquire. In this work, we propose a data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that learns these controls from sparse, low-quality synthetic data. We show that not only does fine-tuning on such simple data enable the desired controls, it actually yields superior results to models fine-tuned on photorealistic "real" data. Beyond demonstrating these results, we provide a framework that justifies this phenomenon both intuitively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MGA-VQA通过图推理和记忆增强机制有效提升了文档视觉问答的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly understand textual semantics, spatial layout, and visual features. Current methods struggle with explicit spatial relationship modeling, inefficiency with high-resolution documents, multi-hop reasoning, and limited interpretability. We propose MGA-VQA, a multi-modal framework that integrates token-level encoding, spatial graph reasoning, memory-augmented inference, and question-guided compression. Unlike prior black-box models, MGA-VQA introduces interpretable graph-based decision pathways and structured memory access for enhanced reasoning transparency. Evaluation across six benchmarks (FUNSD, CORD, SROIE, DocVQA, STE-VQA, and RICO) demonstrates superior accuracy and efficiency, with consistent improvements in both answer prediction and spatial localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在静态3D形状方面取得了显著进展，但关节3D生成由于动作依赖的变形和有限的数据集仍然具有挑战性。

Method: ArticFlow包含两个耦合的流：(i) 将噪声传输到形状先验代码的潜在流；(ii) 在动作和形状先验条件下传输点的点流。

Result: 在MuJoCo Menagerie上，ArticFlow既能作为生成模型也能作为神经模拟器，相比特定对象模拟器和静态点云生成器的动作条件变体，实现了更高的运动学精度和更好的形状质量。

Conclusion: 动作条件流匹配是实现可控和高质量关节机制生成的实用途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have produced strong results for static 3D shapes, whereas articulated 3D generation remains challenging due to action-dependent deformations and limited datasets. We introduce ArticFlow, a two-stage flow matching framework that learns a controllable velocity field from noise to target point sets under explicit action control. ArticFlow couples (i) a latent flow that transports noise to a shape-prior code and (ii) a point flow that transports points conditioned on the action and the shape prior, enabling a single model to represent diverse articulated categories and generalize across actions. On MuJoCo Menagerie, ArticFlow functions both as a generative model and as a neural simulator: it predicts action-conditioned kinematics from a compact prior and synthesizes novel morphologies via latent interpolation. Compared with object-specific simulators and an action-conditioned variant of static point-cloud generators, ArticFlow achieves higher kinematic accuracy and better shape quality. Results show that action-conditioned flow matching is a practical route to controllable and high-quality articulated mechanism generation.

Motivation: 高分辨率视觉输入导致视觉token序列过长和推理延迟，需要减少冗余视觉token以降低计算/内存负担，同时保持性能，使MLLM能在资源受限或延迟敏感场景中部署。

Method: 提出FastMMoE框架，包含两种互补策略：(1)视觉token的专家激活减少，最小化不必要的专家计算；(2)路由感知token剪枝，利用路由概率分布的相似性识别和移除高度冗余的视觉token。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2和InternVL3.5等大规模MoE-MLLM上的实验表明，FastMMoE能减少高达55.0%的FLOPs，同时保持约95.5%的原始性能，在多个保留率下持续优于FastV和SparseVLM等密集模型剪枝基线。

Conclusion: FastMMoE为基于MoE的MLLM提供了有效的训练免费加速解决方案，通过路由分析视角显著减少计算负担，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance, but high-resolution visual inputs result in long sequences of visual tokens and substantial inference latency. Reducing redundant visual tokens is critical to ease computational/memory burdens while preserving performance, enabling MLLM deployment in resource-constrained or latency-sensitive scenarios. Current visual token pruning methods mainly rely on attention-based redundancy analysis and are tailored to dense architectures. We propose Fast Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (FastMMoE), a training-free acceleration framework for mixture-of-experts (MoE) based MLLMs, developed from a routing analysis perspective. FastMMoE combines two complementary strategies: (i) expert activation reduction for visual tokens to minimize unnecessary expert computation; and (ii) routing-aware token pruning that leverages similarity in routing probability distributions to identify and remove highly redundant visual tokens. Experiments on large-scale MoE-MLLMs such as DeepSeek-VL2 and InternVL3.5 demonstrate that FastMMoE can reduce FLOPs by up to 55.0% while retaining approximately 95.5% of the original performance, consistently outperforming dense-model pruning baselines including FastV and SparseVLM across multiple retention rates.

Method: 对一系列CLIP风格教师模型进行系统性蒸馏研究，涵盖从标准基线到大规模最先进模型的范围。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了知识蒸馏中的普遍假设，为设计参数高效的多模态模型指出了新方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across multimodal tasks, yet their substantial computational demands hinder efficient deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.

Conclusion: MINDiff在推理时有效解决个性化文本到图像模型过拟合问题，提供更好的语义控制和文本对齐，无需重新训练。

Abstract: In the personalization process of large-scale text-to-image models, overfitting often occurs when learning specific subject from a limited number of images. Existing methods, such as DreamBooth, mitigate this issue through a class-specific prior-preservation loss, which requires increased computational cost during training and limits user control during inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Mask-Integrated Negative Attention Diffusion (MINDiff). MINDiff introduces a novel concept, negative attention, which suppresses the subject's influence in masked irrelevant regions. We achieve this by modifying the cross-attention mechanism during inference. This enables semantic control and improves text alignment by reducing subject dominance in irrelevant regions. Additionally, during the inference time, users can adjust a scale parameter lambda to balance subject fidelity and text alignment. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on DreamBooth models demonstrate that MINDiff mitigates overfitting more effectively than class-specific prior-preservation loss. As our method operates entirely at inference time and does not alter the model architecture, it can be directly applied to existing DreamBooth models without re-training. Our code is available at https://github.com/seuleepy/MINDiff.

Conclusion: DAVDD通过解耦表示学习成功解决了音频-视觉数据集蒸馏中的跨模态对齐挑战，为高质量数据集压缩提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Dataset Distillation aims to compress large-scale datasets into compact subsets while preserving the performance of the original data. However, conventional Distribution Matching (DM) methods struggle to capture intrinsic cross-modal alignment. Subsequent studies have attempted to introduce cross-modal matching, but two major challenges remain: (i) independently and randomly initialized encoders lead to inconsistent modality mapping spaces, increasing training difficulty; and (ii) direct interactions between modalities tend to damage modality-specific (private) information, thereby degrading the quality of the distilled data. To address these challenges, we propose DAVDD, a pretraining-based decoupled audio-visual distillation framework. DAVDD leverages a diverse pretrained bank to obtain stable modality features and uses a lightweight decoupler bank to disentangle them into common and private representations. To effectively preserve cross-modal structure, we further introduce Common Intermodal Matching together with a Sample-Distribution Joint Alignment strategy, ensuring that shared representations are aligned both at the sample level and the global distribution level. Meanwhile, private representations are entirely isolated from cross-modal interaction, safeguarding modality-specific cues throughout distillation. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DAVDD achieves state-of-the-art results under all IPC settings, demonstrating the effectiveness of decoupled representation learning for high-quality audio-visual dataset distillation. Code will be released.

Conclusion: CUS-GS在性能和模型效率之间取得了优异平衡，为3D场景表示提供了紧凑且统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting based 3D scene representation have shown two major trends: semantics-oriented approaches that focus on high-level understanding but lack explicit 3D geometry modeling, and structure-oriented approaches that capture spatial structures yet provide limited semantic abstraction. To bridge this gap, we present CUS-GS, a compact unified structured Gaussian Splatting representation, which connects multimodal semantic features with structured 3D geometry. Specifically, we design a voxelized anchor structure that constructs a spatial scaffold, while extracting multimodal semantic features from a set of foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, SEEM). Moreover, we introduce a multimodal latent feature allocation mechanism to unify appearance, geometry, and semantics across heterogeneous feature spaces, ensuring a consistent representation across multiple foundation models. Finally, we propose a feature-aware significance evaluation strategy to dynamically guide anchor growing and pruning, effectively removing redundant or invalid anchors while maintaining semantic integrity. Extensive experiments show that CUS-GS achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods using as few as 6M parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than the closest rival at 35M - highlighting the excellent trade off between performance and model efficiency of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large-scale datasets into compact, highly informative synthetic data, significantly reducing storage and training costs. However, existing research primarily focuses on balanced datasets and struggles to perform under real-world long-tailed distributions. In this work, we emphasize the critical role of soft labels in long-tailed dataset distillation and uncover the underlying mechanisms contributing to performance degradation. Specifically, we derive an imbalance-aware generalization bound for model trained on distilled dataset. We then identify two primary sources of soft-label bias, which originate from the distillation model and the distilled images, through systematic perturbation of the data imbalance levels. To address this, we propose ADSA, an Adaptive Soft-label Alignment module that calibrates the entangled biases. This lightweight module integrates seamlessly into existing distillation pipelines and consistently improves performance. On ImageNet-1k-LT with EDC and IPC=50, ADSA improves tail-class accuracy by up to 11.8% and raises overall accuracy to 41.4%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ADSA provides a robust and generalizable solution under limited label budgets and across a range of distillation techniques.

*Youngsik Yun,Dongjun Gu,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了频率自适应锐度正则化(FASR)方法，通过改进3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)的训练目标，解决其在少样本场景下对新视角泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在大多数配置下表现出色，但在少样本场景中缺乏对新视角的泛化能力，因为它过度拟合稀疏观测数据。

Method: 将新视角合成重新定义为对未见视角的泛化问题，提出FASR方法，根据图像局部频率设置正则化权重和邻域半径来估计局部锐度。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集的各种配置下，持续改进了广泛的基线方法，防止了新视角中的浮动伪影并重建了精细细节。

Conclusion: FASR通过频率自适应锐度正则化有效提升了3DGS的泛化能力，在少样本新视角合成任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Despite 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excelling in most configurations, it lacks generalization across novel viewpoints in a few-shot scenario because it overfits to the sparse observations. We revisit 3DGS optimization from a machine learning perspective, framing novel view synthesis as a generalization problem to unseen viewpoints-an underexplored direction. We propose Frequency-Adaptive Sharpness Regularization (FASR), which reformulates the 3DGS training objective, thereby guiding 3DGS to converge toward a better generalization solution. Although Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) similarly reduces the sharpness of the loss landscape to improve generalization of classification models, directly employing it to 3DGS is suboptimal due to the discrepancy between the tasks. Specifically, it hinders reconstructing high-frequency details due to excessive regularization, while reducing its strength leads to under-penalizing sharpness. To address this, we reflect the local frequency of images to set the regularization weight and the neighborhood radius when estimating the local sharpness. It prevents floater artifacts in novel viewpoints and reconstructs fine details that SAM tends to oversmooth. Across datasets with various configurations, our method consistently improves a wide range of baselines. Code will be available at https://bbangsik13.github.io/FASR.

TL;DR: PA-FAS通过构建高质量扩展推理序列和答案混洗机制，解决了多模态人脸反欺诈中监督微调+强化学习的局限性，提升了多模态推理准确性和跨域泛化能力。

Motivation: 多模态人脸反欺诈面临复杂推理需求，但监督微调+强化学习存在两个关键问题：有限的多模态推理路径限制了互补模态的使用，以及单任务监督与多样化推理路径不匹配导致推理混淆和捷径学习。

Method: 提出PA-FAS方法：1）从有限标注构建高质量扩展推理序列，丰富推理路径并放松探索约束；2）在监督微调阶段引入答案混洗机制，强制进行全面的多模态分析而非使用表面线索。

Conclusion: PA-FAS通过增强推理路径和防止捷径学习，有效解决了多模态人脸反欺诈中的关键挑战，实现了更可靠的多模态推理和泛化性能。

Abstract: Face anti-spoofing (FAS) has recently advanced in multimodal fusion, cross-domain generalization, and interpretability. With large language models and reinforcement learning (RL), strategy-based training offers new opportunities to jointly model these aspects. However, multimodal reasoning is more complex than unimodal reasoning, requiring accurate feature representation and cross-modal verification while facing scarce, high-quality annotations, which makes direct application of RL sub-optimal. We identify two key limitations of supervised fine-tuning plus RL (SFT+RL) for multimodal FAS: (1) limited multimodal reasoning paths restrict the use of complementary modalities and shrink the exploration space after SFT, weakening the effect of RL; and (2) mismatched single-task supervision versus diverse reasoning paths causes reasoning confusion, where models may exploit shortcuts by mapping images directly to answers and ignoring the intended reasoning. To address this, we propose PA-FAS, which enhances reasoning paths by constructing high-quality extended reasoning sequences from limited annotations, enriching paths and relaxing exploration constraints. We further introduce an answer-shuffling mechanism during SFT to force comprehensive multimodal analysis instead of using superficial cues, thereby encouraging deeper reasoning and mitigating shortcut learning. PA-FAS significantly improves multimodal reasoning accuracy and cross-domain generalization, and better unifies multimodal fusion, generalization, and interpretability for trustworthy FAS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MambaTAD是一个基于状态空间模型的时序动作检测方法，通过引入对角掩码双向状态空间模块和全局特征融合头，解决了长跨度动作检测中的上下文衰减和全局建模问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统时序动作检测方法在处理长跨度动作实例时缺乏全局感知能力，而现有的结构化状态空间模型在时序动作检测中面临上下文衰减和自元素冲突的挑战。

Method: 提出MambaTAD模型，包含对角掩码双向状态空间(DMBSS)模块促进全局特征融合，以及全局特征融合头进行多粒度特征精炼，采用端到端单阶段检测方式，使用状态空间时序适配器(SSTA)降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，MambaTAD实现了优异的时序动作检测性能。

Conclusion: MambaTAD通过创新的状态空间模型设计，有效解决了长跨度动作检测的挑战，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时提升了检测精度。

Abstract: Temporal Action Detection (TAD) aims to identify and localize actions by determining their starting and ending frames within untrimmed videos. Recent Structured State-Space Models such as Mamba have demonstrated potential in TAD due to their long-range modeling capability and linear computational complexity. On the other hand, structured state-space models often face two key challenges in TAD, namely, decay of temporal context due to recursive processing and self-element conflict during global visual context modeling, which become more severe while handling long-span action instances. Additionally, traditional methods for TAD struggle with detecting long-span action instances due to a lack of global awareness and inefficient detection heads. This paper presents MambaTAD, a new state-space TAD model that introduces long-range modeling and global feature detection capabilities for accurate temporal action detection. MambaTAD comprises two novel designs that complement each other with superior TAD performance. First, it introduces a Diagonal-Masked Bidirectional State-Space (DMBSS) module which effectively facilitates global feature fusion and temporal action detection. Second, it introduces a global feature fusion head that refines the detection progressively with multi-granularity features and global awareness. In addition, MambaTAD tackles TAD in an end-to-end one-stage manner using a new state-space temporal adapter(SSTA) which reduces network parameters and computation cost with linear complexity. Extensive experiments show that MambaTAD achieves superior TAD performance consistently across multiple public benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniRSCD框架成功将多种变化检测任务集成到统一架构中，适应不同任务的输出粒度要求，实现了通用性和性能的平衡。

Abstract: In recent years, remote sensing change detection has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in resource monitoring and disaster assessment. Change detection tasks exist with different output granularities such as BCD, SCD, and BDA. However, existing methods require substantial expert knowledge to design specialized decoders that compensate for information loss during encoding across different tasks. This not only introduces uncertainty into the process of selecting optimal models for abrupt change scenarios (such as disaster outbreaks) but also limits the universality of these architectures. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, general change detection framework named UniRSCD. Building upon a state space model backbone, we introduce a frequency change prompt generator as a unified encoder. The encoder dynamically scans bitemporal global context information while integrating high-frequency details with low-frequency holistic information, thereby eliminating the need for specialized decoders for feature compensation. Subsequently, the unified decoder and prediction head establish a shared representation space through hierarchical feature interaction and task-adaptive output mapping. This integrating various tasks such as binary change detection and semantic change detection into a unified architecture, thereby accommodating the differing output granularity requirements of distinct change detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture can adapt to multiple change detection tasks and achieves leading performance on five datasets, including the binary change dataset LEVIR-CD, the semantic change dataset SECOND, and the building damage assessment dataset xBD.

TL;DR: V2X-RECT是一个针对高密度交通场景的轨迹预测框架，通过多源身份匹配、交通信号引导的交互模块和局部时空坐标编码，解决了身份切换、冗余交互和重复编码等问题，显著提升了预测精度和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在密集交通场景中，目标频繁的身份切换阻碍了跨视角关联和融合，多源信息在编码阶段产生冗余交互，传统的以车辆为中心的编码导致大量重复的历史轨迹特征编码，降低了实时推理性能。

Method: 1. 多源身份匹配和校正模块，利用多视角时空关系实现稳定一致的目标关联；2. 交通信号引导的交互模块，编码交通灯变化趋势并过滤关键交互车辆；3. 局部时空坐标编码，实现历史轨迹和地图特征的可复用，支持并行解码。

Conclusion: V2X-RECT通过增强数据关联一致性、减少冗余交互和复用历史信息，实现了更高效准确的轨迹预测，特别适用于高密度交通环境。

Abstract: V2X prediction can alleviate perception incompleteness caused by limited line of sight through fusing trajectory data from infrastructure and vehicles, which is crucial to traffic safety and efficiency. However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and video agent systems have significantly improved general video understanding. However, when applied to scientific video understanding and educating, a domain that demands external professional knowledge integration and rigorous step-wise reasoning, existing approaches often struggle. To bridge this gap, we propose SciEducator, the first iterative self-evolving multi-agent system for scientific video comprehension and education. Rooted in the classical Deming Cycle from management science, our design reformulates its Plan-Do-Study-Act philosophy into a self-evolving reasoning and feedback mechanism, which facilitates the interpretation of intricate scientific activities in videos. Moreover, SciEducator can produce multimodal educational content tailored to specific scientific processes, including textual instructions, visual guides, audio narrations, and interactive references. To support evaluation, we construct SciVBench, a benchmark consisting of 500 expert-verified and literature-grounded science QA pairs across five categories, covering physical, chemical, and everyday phenomena. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SciEducator substantially outperforms leading closed-source MLLMs (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o) and state-of-the-art video agents on the benchmark, establishing a new paradigm for the community.

Conclusion: T3S将视频冗余转化为计算优势，为长视频理解提供了可扩展的解决方案，无需模型修改或微调，与多种预训练MLLMs兼容。

Abstract: Processing long videos with multimodal large language models (MLLMs) poses a significant computational challenge, as the model's self-attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of video tokens, resulting in high computational demand and slow inference speed. Current solutions, such as rule-based sub-sampling, learned frame selector, or memory-based summarization, often introduce their own trade-offs: they compromise accuracy, necessitate additional training, or decrease inference speed. In this paper, we propose Test-Time Temporal Sampling (T3S), a training-free, plug-and-play inference wrapper that enables MLLMs to process long videos both efficiently and effectively. T3S exploits spatiotemporal redundancy by generating multiple short and diverse subsequences of video tokens at inference time, packing them within a single forward pass, and aggregating their predictions. This multi-subsequence formulation broadens visual coverage while reducing the computational cost of self-attention from $O(L^2)$ to $O(\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2L^2)$, where $\sum_{i=1}^m α_i^2 < 1$. Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that T3S improves accuracy by up to 3.1% and reduces first token delay by $2.04\times$, all with minimal integration effort. Our approach operates entirely at inference time, requires no model modifications or fine-tuning, and is compatible with a wide range of pretrained MLLMs. T3S turns video redundancy into a computational advantage, offering a scalable solution for long-video understanding. The code is available at https://github.com/kaibinwang3/T3S.

Conclusion: 该方法成功使模型聚焦于说话人相关区域，实现了更稳健的多方社交推理，无需引入可训练参数或架构改变。

Abstract: Understanding social interaction in video requires reasoning over a dynamic interplay of verbal and non-verbal cues: who is speaking, to whom, and with what gaze or gestures. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are natural candidates, simply adding visual inputs yields surprisingly inconsistent gains on social tasks. Our quantitative analysis of cross-modal attention inside state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a core failure mode: in multi-speaker scenes, visual and textual tokens lack speaker-consistent alignment, exhibiting substantially weaker cross-modal attention than in object-centric images. To address this, we propose a multimodal multi-speaker attention alignment method that can be integrated into existing MLLMs. First, we introduce dynamic cross-modal head selection to identify attention heads most responsible for grounding. Then, an adaptive social-aware attention bias, computed from existing attention patterns and speaker locations, is injected into the attention mechanism. This bias reinforces alignment between a speaker's visual representation and their utterances without introducing trainable parameters or architectural changes. We integrate our method into three distinct MLLMs (LLaVA-NeXT-Video, Qwen2.5-VL, and InternVL3) and evaluate on three benchmarks (TVQA+, MMSI, OnlineMMSI). Across four social tasks, results demonstrate that our approach improves the ability of MLLMs and achieves state-of-the-art results. Attention visualizations confirm our method successfully focuses the model on speaker-relevant regions, enabling more robust multi-party social reasoning. Our implementation and model will be available at https://github.com/ut-vision/SocialInteraction.

Conclusion: HEAL框架有效解决了源自由无监督域自适应中的关键挑战，在跨模态场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Growing demands for clinical data privacy and storage constraints have spurred advances in Source Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA). SFUDA addresses the domain shift by adapting models from the source domain to the unseen target domain without accessing source data, even when target-domain labels are unavailable. However, SFUDA faces significant challenges: the absence of source domain data and label supervision in the target domain due to source free and unsupervised settings. To address these issues, we propose HEAL, a novel SFUDA framework that integrates Hierarchical denoising, Edge-guided selection, size-Aware fusion, and Learning-free characteristic. Large-scale cross-modality experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing SFUDA approaches, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Conclusion: 该工作为推进VQualA基础LMM的发展奠定了基石。

Abstract: Developing a robust visual quality assessment (VQualA) large multi-modal model (LMM) requires achieving versatility, powerfulness, and transferability.
  However, existing VQualA LMMs typically focus on a single task and rely on full-parameter fine-tuning, which makes them prone to overfitting on specific modalities or task types, thereby limiting their generalization capacity and transferability. To address this, we propose a vision-encoder-centered generative pre-training pipeline and develop the VITAL-Series LMMs. (1) We adopt a machine-executed annotation-scrutiny paradigm, constructing over 4.5M vision-language (VL) pairs-the largest VQualA training dataset to date. (2) We employ a multi-task training workflow that simultaneously enhances the model's quantitative scoring precision and strengthens its capability for quality interpretation across both image and video modalities. (3) Building upon the vision encoder, we realize an efficient model zoo extension: the model zoo exhibits strong zero-shot performance, and each paired decoder requires only a swift warm-up using less than 1/1000 of the pre-training data to achieve performance comparable to the fully trained counterpart. Overall, our work lays a cornerstone for advancing toward the foundation LMM for VQualA.

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have recently achieved remarkable performance in retrieval tasks, yet their potential for Video-based Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification (VVI-ReID) remains largely unexplored. The primary challenges are narrowing the modality gap and leveraging spatiotemporal information in video sequences. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel cross-modality feature learning framework named X-ReID for VVI-ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Cross-modality Prototype Collaboration (CPC) to align and integrate features from different modalities, guiding the network to reduce the modality discrepancy. Then, a Multi-granularity Information Interaction (MII) is designed, incorporating short-term interactions from adjacent frames, long-term cross-frame information fusion, and cross-modality feature alignment to enhance temporal modeling and further reduce modality gaps. Finally, by integrating multi-granularity information, a robust sequence-level representation is achieved. Extensive experiments on two large-scale VVI-ReID benchmarks (i.e., HITSZ-VCM and BUPTCampus) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) is devoted to retrieving specific objects through the exploitation of complementary multi-modal image information. Existing methods mainly concentrate on the fusion of multi-modal features, yet neglecting the background interference. Besides, current multi-modal fusion methods often focus on aligning modality pairs but suffer from multi-modal consistency alignment. To address these issues, we propose a novel selective interaction and global-local alignment framework called Signal for multi-modal object ReID. Specifically, we first propose a Selective Interaction Module (SIM) to select important patch tokens with intra-modal and inter-modal information. These important patch tokens engage in the interaction with class tokens, thereby yielding more discriminative features. Then, we propose a Global Alignment Module (GAM) to simultaneously align multi-modal features by minimizing the volume of 3D polyhedra in the gramian space. Meanwhile, we propose a Local Alignment Module (LAM) to align local features in a shift-aware manner. With these modules, our proposed framework could extract more discriminative features for object ReID. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks (i.e., RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) validate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: CADTrack框架通过创新的模态交互和融合机制，显著提升了RGB-T跟踪性能，解决了模态差异带来的挑战。

Abstract: RGB-Thermal (RGBT) tracking aims to exploit visible and thermal infrared modalities for robust all-weather object tracking. However, existing RGBT trackers struggle to resolve modality discrepancies, which poses great challenges for robust feature representation. This limitation hinders effective cross-modal information propagation and fusion, which significantly reduces the tracking accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Contextual Aggregation with Deformable Alignment framework called CADTrack for RGBT Tracking. To be specific, we first deploy the Mamba-based Feature Interaction (MFI) that establishes efficient feature interaction via state space models. This interaction module can operate with linear complexity, reducing computational cost and improving feature discrimination. Then, we propose the Contextual Aggregation Module (CAM) that dynamically activates backbone layers through sparse gating based on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). This module can encode complementary contextual information from cross-layer features. Finally, we propose the Deformable Alignment Module (DAM) to integrate deformable sampling and temporal propagation, mitigating spatial misalignment and localization drift. With the above components, our CADTrack achieves robust and accurate tracking in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on five RGBT tracking benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our proposed method. The source code is released at https://github.com/IdolLab/CADTrack.

Conclusion: APR方法通过在线生成伪回放样本和协方差校准，成功解决了EFCIL中的灾难性遗忘问题，无需存储历史数据。

Abstract: Exemplar-free class-incremental learning (EFCIL) aims to retain old knowledge acquired in the previous task while learning new classes, without storing the previous images due to storage constraints or privacy concerns. In EFCIL, the plasticity-stability dilemma, learning new tasks versus catastrophic forgetting, is a significant challenge, primarily due to the unavailability of images from earlier tasks. In this paper, we introduce adversarial pseudo-replay (APR), a method that perturbs the images of the new task with adversarial attack, to synthesize the pseudo-replay images online without storing any replay samples. During the new task training, the adversarial attack is conducted on the new task images with augmented old class mean prototypes as targets, and the resulting images are used for knowledge distillation to prevent semantic drift. Moreover, we calibrate the covariance matrices to compensate for the semantic drift after each task, by learning a transfer matrix on the pseudo-replay samples. Our method reconciles stability and plasticity, achieving state-of-the-art on challenging cold-start settings of the standard EFCIL benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, yet how to effectively adapt large pretrained models to new tasks remains challenging. We revisit the reconstruction behavior of diffusion models during denoising to unveil the underlying frequency energy mechanism governing this process. Building upon this observation, we propose FeRA, a frequency driven fine tuning framework that aligns parameter updates with the intrinsic frequency energy progression of diffusion. FeRA establishes a comprehensive frequency energy framework for effective diffusion adaptation fine tuning, comprising three synergistic components: (i) a compact frequency energy indicator that characterizes the latent bandwise energy distribution, (ii) a soft frequency router that adaptively fuses multiple frequency specific adapter experts, and (iii) a frequency energy consistency regularization that stabilizes diffusion optimization and ensures coherent adaptation across bands. Routing operates in both training and inference, with inference time routing dynamically determined by the latent frequency energy. It integrates seamlessly with adapter based tuning schemes and generalizes well across diffusion backbones and resolutions. By aligning adaptation with the frequency energy mechanism, FeRA provides a simple, stable, and compatible paradigm for effective and robust diffusion model adaptation.

Motivation: 扩散变换器在视觉合成中表现出色，但在高级语义推理和长时规划方面存在困难，导致视觉幻觉和用户指令不对齐的问题，特别是在复杂场景理解、人-物交互、多阶段动作和上下文运动推理等场景中。

Method: 提出Plan-X框架，核心是语义规划器——一个可学习的多模态语言模型，从文本提示和视觉上下文中推理用户意图，并自回归生成基于文本的时空语义标记序列，作为视频扩散模型的结构化"语义草图"。

Conclusion: Plan-X有效整合了语言模型在多模态上下文推理和规划方面的优势，以及扩散模型在逼真视频合成方面的优势，实现了更高质量的语义感知视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis, yet they often struggle with high-level semantic reasoning and long-horizon planning. This limitation frequently leads to visual hallucinations and mis-alignments with user instructions, especially in scenarios involving complex scene understanding, human-object interactions, multi-stage actions, and in-context motion reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose Plan-X, a framework that explicitly enforces high-level semantic planning to instruct video generation process. At its core lies a Semantic Planner, a learnable multimodal language model that reasons over the user's intent from both text prompts and visual context, and autoregressively generates a sequence of text-grounded spatio-temporal semantic tokens. These semantic tokens, complementary to high-level text prompt guidance, serve as structured "semantic sketches" over time for the video diffusion model, which has its strength at synthesizing high-fidelity visual details. Plan-X effectively integrates the strength of language models in multimodal in-context reasoning and planning, together with the strength of diffusion models in photorealistic video synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework substantially reduces visual hallucinations and enables fine-grained, instruction-aligned video generation consistent with multimodal context.

Abstract: Accurate organ and lesion segmentation is a critical prerequisite for computer-aided diagnosis. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), constrained by their local receptive fields, often struggle to capture complex global anatomical structures. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel hybrid architecture, HyM-UNet, designed to synergize the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs with the efficient global modeling capabilities of Mamba. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Encoder that utilizes convolutional modules in the shallow stages to preserve high-frequency texture details, while introducing Visual Mamba modules in the deep stages to capture long-range semantic dependencies with linear complexity. To bridge the semantic gap between the encoder and the decoder, we propose a Mamba-Guided Fusion Skip Connection (MGF-Skip). This module leverages deep semantic features as gating signals to dynamically suppress background noise within shallow features, thereby enhancing the perception of ambiguous boundaries. We conduct extensive experiments on public benchmark dataset ISIC 2018. The results demonstrate that HyM-UNet significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice coefficient and IoU, while maintaining lower parameter counts and inference latency. This validates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method in handling medical segmentation tasks characterized by complex shapes and scale variations.

Abstract: Image deraining is crucial for vision applications but is challenged by the complex multi-scale physics of rain and its coupling with scenes. To address this challenge, a novel approach inspired by multi-stage image restoration is proposed, incorporating Point Spread Function (PSF) mechanisms to reveal the image degradation process while combining dynamic physical modeling with sequential feature fusion transfer, named SD-PSFNet. Specifically, SD-PSFNet employs a sequential restoration architecture with three cascaded stages, allowing multiple dynamic evaluations and refinements of the degradation process estimation. The network utilizes components with learned PSF mechanisms to dynamically simulate rain streak optics, enabling effective rain-background separation while progressively enhancing outputs through novel PSF components at each stage. Additionally, SD-PSFNet incorporates adaptive gated fusion for optimal cross-stage feature integration, enabling sequential refinement from coarse rain removal to fine detail restoration. Our model achieves state-of-the-art PSNR/SSIM metrics on Rain100H (33.12dB/0.9371), RealRain-1k-L (42.28dB/0.9872), and RealRain-1k-H (41.08dB/0.9838). In summary, SD-PSFNet demonstrates excellent capability in complex scenes and dense rainfall conditions, providing a new physics-aware approach to image deraining.

Conclusion: LMI-AL框架为纵向医学影像变化检测提供了一种高效的标注策略，显著降低了标注成本，代码已开源。

Abstract: Detecting changes in longitudinal medical imaging using deep learning requires a substantial amount of accurately labeled data. However, labeling these images is notably more costly and time-consuming than labeling other image types, as it requires labeling across various time points, where new lesions can be minor, and subtle changes are easily missed. Deep Active Learning (DAL) has shown promise in minimizing labeling costs by selectively querying the most informative samples, but existing studies have primarily focused on static tasks like classification and segmentation. Consequently, the conventional DAL approach cannot be directly applied to change detection tasks, which involve identifying subtle differences across multiple images. In this study, we propose a novel DAL framework, named Longitudinal Medical Imaging Active Learning (LMI-AL), tailored specifically for longitudinal medical imaging. By pairing and differencing all 2D slices from baseline and follow-up 3D images, LMI-AL iteratively selects the most informative pairs for labeling using DAL, training a deep learning model with minimal manual annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that, with less than 8% of the data labeled, LMI-AL can achieve performance comparable to models trained on fully labeled datasets. We also provide a detailed analysis of the method's performance, as guidance for future research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/HelenMa9998/Longitudinal_AL.

Conclusion: RoadBench基准测试及其发现将有助于全面推动MLLM空间理解能力的发展，基准代码、示例数据集和原始评估结果已公开。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities in general spatial understanding and reasoning. However, their fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities in complex urban scenarios have not received significant attention in the fields of both research and industry. To fill this gap, we focus primarily on road markings as a typical example of fine-grained spatial elements under urban scenarios, given the essential role of the integrated road traffic network they form within cities. Around road markings and urban traffic systems, we propose RoadBench, a systematic benchmark that comprehensively evaluates MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities using BEV and FPV image inputs. This benchmark comprises six tasks consisting of 9,121 strictly manually verified test cases. These tasks form a systematic evaluation framework that bridges understanding at local spatial scopes to global reasoning. They not only test MLLMs' capabilities in recognition, joint understanding, and reasoning but also assess their ability to integrate image information with domain knowledge. After evaluating 14 mainstream MLLMs, we confirm that RoadBench is a challenging benchmark for MLLMs while revealing significant shortcomings in existing MLLMs' fine-grained spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities within urban scenarios. In certain tasks, their performance even falls short of simple rule-based or random selection baselines. These findings, along with RoadBench itself, will contribute to the comprehensive advancement of spatial understanding capabilities for MLLMs. The benchmark code, example datasets, and raw evaluation results are available in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键挑战：1）语义原型是静态的，无法捕捉由不同物体状态引起的丰富类内视觉变化；2）标准伪框生成导致视觉区域提议（包含上下文）与以物体为中心的文本嵌入之间存在语义不匹配。

Method: 1）SESP：生成状态感知的文本描述来捕捉多样化的物体外观，产生更具区分性的原型；2）SAPP：结合上下文语义，使用软对齐机制促进上下文一致的视觉-文本表示。

Result: 通过整合SESP和SAPP，有效增强了语义原型的丰富性和视觉-文本对齐，实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的两种互补原型增强策略成功解决了弱监督开放词汇目标检测中的关键挑战，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) aims to generalize object recognition to novel categories, while Weakly Supervised OVOD (WS-OVOD) extends this by combining box-level annotations with image-level labels. Despite recent progress, two critical challenges persist in this setting. First, existing semantic prototypes, even when enriched by LLMs, are static and limited, failing to capture the rich intra-class visual variations induced by different object states (e.g., a cat's pose). Second, the standard pseudo-box generation introduces a semantic mismatch between visual region proposals (which contain context) and object-centric text embeddings. To tackle these issues, we introduce two complementary prototype enhancement strategies. To capture intra-class variations in appearance and state, we propose the State-Enhanced Semantic Prototypes (SESP), which generates state-aware textual descriptions (e.g., "a sleeping cat") to capture diverse object appearances, yielding more discriminative prototypes. Building on this, we further introduce Scene-Augmented Pseudo Prototypes (SAPP) to address the semantic mismatch. SAPP incorporates contextual semantics (e.g., "cat lying on sofa") and utilizes a soft alignment mechanism to promote contextually consistent visual-textual representations. By integrating SESP and SAPP, our method effectively enhances both the richness of semantic prototypes and the visual-textual alignment, achieving notable improvements.

Motivation: 现有超分辨率方法主要关注最终分辨率提升，但忽视了中间阶段的误差传播控制。Mamba方法虽然能表示重建过程为状态序列，但其固定线性映射器感受野窄、灵活性受限，在细粒度图像中效果不佳。

Method: 创建非线性状态预测控制模型MambaX：1）动态状态预测控制学习近似状态空间模型的非线性微分系数；2）引入状态交叉控制范式进行多模态超分辨率融合；3）采用渐进过渡学习缓解领域和模态偏移引起的异质性。

Result: 评估显示该动态频谱-状态表示模型在单图像超分辨率和多模态融合超分辨率任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: MambaX模型在任意维度和模态的光谱广义建模方面具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Image super-resolution (SR) is a critical technology for overcoming the inherent hardware limitations of sensors. However, existing approaches mainly focus on directly enhancing the final resolution, often neglecting effective control over error propagation and accumulation during intermediate stages. Recently, Mamba has emerged as a promising approach that can represent the entire reconstruction process as a state sequence with multiple nodes, allowing for intermediate intervention. Nonetheless, its fixed linear mapper is limited by a narrow receptive field and restricted flexibility, which hampers its effectiveness in fine-grained images. To address this, we created a nonlinear state predictive control model \textbf{MambaX} that maps consecutive spectral bands into a latent state space and generalizes the SR task by dynamically learning the nonlinear state parameters of control equations. Compared to existing sequence models, MambaX 1) employs dynamic state predictive control learning to approximate the nonlinear differential coefficients of state-space models; 2) introduces a novel state cross-control paradigm for multimodal SR fusion; and 3) utilizes progressive transitional learning to mitigate heterogeneity caused by domain and modality shifts. Our evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the dynamic spectrum-state representation model in both single-image SR and multimodal fusion-based SR tasks, highlighting its substantial potential to advance spectrally generalized modeling across arbitrary dimensions and modalities.

Conclusion: 该工作为事件帧混合传感器提供了首个统一的噪声模型和校准方法，显著提升了模拟数据的真实性和实用性。

Abstract: Event frame hybrid sensors integrate an Active Pixel Sensor (APS) and an Event Vision Sensor (EVS) within a single chip, combining the high dynamic range and low latency of the EVS with the rich spatial intensity information from the APS. While this tight integration offers compact, temporally precise imaging, the complex circuit architecture introduces non-trivial noise patterns that remain poorly understood and unmodeled. In this work, we present the first unified, statistics-based imaging noise model that jointly describes the noise behavior of APS and EVS pixels. Our formulation explicitly incorporates photon shot noise, dark current noise, fixed-pattern noise, and quantization noise, and links EVS noise to illumination level and dark current. Based on this formulation, we further develop a calibration pipeline to estimate noise parameters from real data and offer a detailed analysis of both APS and EVS noise behaviors. Finally, we propose HESIM, a statistically grounded simulator that generates RAW frames and events under realistic, jointly calibrated noise statistics. Experiments on two hybrid sensors validate our model across multiple imaging tasks (e.g., video frame interpolation and deblurring), demonstrating strong transfer from simulation to real data.

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have recently delivered strong text-to-image generation around 1K resolution, but we show that extending them to native 4K across diverse aspect ratios exposes a tightly coupled failure mode spanning positional encoding, VAE compression, and optimization. Tackling any of these factors in isolation leaves substantial quality on the table. We therefore take a data-model co-design view and introduce UltraFlux, a Flux-based DiT trained natively at 4K on MultiAspect-4K-1M, a 1M-image 4K corpus with controlled multi-AR coverage, bilingual captions, and rich VLM/IQA metadata for resolution- and AR-aware sampling. On the model side, UltraFlux couples (i) Resonance 2D RoPE with YaRN for training-window-, frequency-, and AR-aware positional encoding at 4K; (ii) a simple, non-adversarial VAE post-training scheme that improves 4K reconstruction fidelity; (iii) an SNR-Aware Huber Wavelet objective that rebalances gradients across timesteps and frequency bands; and (iv) a Stage-wise Aesthetic Curriculum Learning strategy that concentrates high-aesthetic supervision on high-noise steps governed by the model prior. Together, these components yield a stable, detail-preserving 4K DiT that generalizes across wide, square, and tall ARs. On the Aesthetic-Eval at 4096 benchmark and multi-AR 4K settings, UltraFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source baselines across fidelity, aesthetic, and alignment metrics, and-with a LLM prompt refiner-matches or surpasses the proprietary Seedream 4.0.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了IE-Bench基准套件和IE-Critic-R1评估方法，用于改进文本驱动图像编辑的质量评估，该评估方法通过强化学习从可验证奖励中学习，与人类感知更加一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本驱动图像编辑的评估具有挑战性，因为它同时依赖于文本和源图像，编辑后的图像与原始图像保持内在联系，而现有方法主要关注文本-图像对齐或未很好地对齐人类感知。

Method: 构建了IE-Bench基准套件，包含多样化源图像、编辑提示和不同编辑方法的结果，以及近4000个样本的人类主观评分；提出了IE-Critic-R1评估方法，利用从可验证奖励的强化学习来提供更全面和可解释的质量评估。

Conclusion: IE-Bench和IE-Critic-R1为文本驱动图像编辑提供了更好的评估基准和方法，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven image editing have been significant, yet the task of accurately evaluating these edited images continues to pose a considerable challenge. Different from the assessment of text-driven image generation, text-driven image editing is characterized by simultaneously conditioning on both text and a source image. The edited images often retain an intrinsic connection to the original image, which dynamically change with the semantics of the text. However, previous methods tend to solely focus on text-image alignment or have not well aligned with human perception. In this work, we introduce the Text-driven Image Editing Benchmark suite (IE-Bench) to enhance the assessment of text-driven edited images. IE-Bench includes a database contains diverse source images, various editing prompts and the corresponding edited results from different editing methods, and nearly 4,000 samples with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) provided by 15 human subjects. Furthermore, we introduce IE-Critic-R1, which, benefiting from Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), provides more comprehensive and explainable quality assessment for text-driven image editing that aligns with human perception. Extensive experiments demonstrate IE-Critic-R1's superior subjective-alignments on the text-driven image editing task compared with previous metrics. Related data and codes are available to the public.

*Wei Huang,Zhitong Xiong,Chenying Liu,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种分层半监督主动学习框架HSSAL，通过结合半监督学习和分层主动学习，在遥感场景分类中仅需少量标注数据即可达到接近全监督的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感领域深度学习模型性能严重依赖高质量标注数据，但大规模标注成本高昂且耗时，而大量未标注图像未被充分利用。

Method: HSSAL框架将半监督学习和分层主动学习集成在闭环迭代中：SSL通过监督学习和弱到强自训练改进特征表示和不确定性估计；HAL通过渐进聚类策略选择同时满足可扩展性、多样性和不确定性的最有信息样本。

Result: 在UCM、AID和NWPU-RESISC45三个遥感场景分类数据集上，HSSAL仅需8%、4%和2%的标注训练数据即可达到超过95%的全监督准确率，显著优于仅使用SSL或AL的基线方法。

Conclusion: HSSAL通过有效利用未标注数据的信息性，实现了卓越的标签效率，为遥感领域的数据标注成本问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models in remote sensing (RS) strongly depends on the availability of high-quality labeled data. However, collecting large-scale annotations is costly and time-consuming, while vast amounts of unlabeled imagery remain underutilized. To address this challenge, we propose a Hierarchical Semi-Supervised Active Learning (HSSAL) framework that integrates semi-supervised learning (SSL) and a novel hierarchical active learning (HAL) in a closed iterative loop. In each iteration, SSL refines the model using both labeled data through supervised learning and unlabeled data via weak-to-strong self-training, improving feature representation and uncertainty estimation. Guided by the refined representations and uncertainty cues of unlabeled samples, HAL then conducts sample querying through a progressive clustering strategy, selecting the most informative instances that jointly satisfy the criteria of scalability, diversity, and uncertainty. This hierarchical process ensures both efficiency and representativeness in sample selection. Extensive experiments on three benchmark RS scene classification datasets, including UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, demonstrate that HSSAL consistently outperforms SSL- or AL-only baselines. Remarkably, with only 8%, 4%, and 2% labeled training data on UCM, AID, and NWPU-RESISC45, respectively, HSSAL achieves over 95% of fully-supervised accuracy, highlighting its superior label efficiency through informativeness exploitation of unlabeled data. Our code will be released at https://github.com/zhu-xlab/RS-SSAL.

Abstract: Cervical adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is a critical premalignant lesion whose accurate histopathological diagnosis is challenging. Early detection is essential to prevent progression to invasive cervical adenocarcinoma. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based virtual pathology assistant capable of distinguishing AIS from normal cervical gland histology using the CAISHI dataset, which contains 2240 expert-labeled H&E images (1010 normal and 1230 AIS). All images underwent Macenko stain normalization and patch-based preprocessing to enhance morphological feature representation. An EfficientNet-B3 convolutional neural network was trained using class-balanced sampling and focal loss to address dataset imbalance and emphasize difficult examples. The final model achieved an overall accuracy of 0.7323, with an F1-score of 0.75 for the Abnormal class and 0.71 for the Normal class. Grad-CAM heatmaps demonstrated biologically interpretable activation patterns, highlighting nuclear atypia and glandular crowding consistent with AIS morphology. The trained model was deployed in a Gradio-based virtual diagnostic assistant. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of lightweight, interpretable AI systems for cervical gland pathology, with potential applications in screening workflows, education, and low-resource settings.

TL;DR: VK-Det是一个无需额外监督的视觉知识引导开放词汇目标检测框架，通过利用视觉编码器的固有区域感知能力和原型感知伪标签策略，在航空图像上实现了最先进的开放词汇检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇航空目标检测方法依赖文本监督，导致语义偏差，限制了向文本指定概念之外的词汇扩展。需要一种不依赖额外监督的方法来突破这一限制。

Method: 1. 利用视觉编码器的固有信息区域感知能力进行细粒度定位和自适应蒸馏；2. 提出原型感知伪标签策略，通过特征聚类建模类间决策边界，通过原型匹配将检测区域映射到潜在类别。

Result: 在DIOR数据集上达到30.1 mAP^N，在DOTA数据集上达到23.3 mAP^N，甚至超过了使用额外监督的方法。

Conclusion: VK-Det框架通过视觉知识引导和原型感知伪标签，有效解决了开放词汇目标检测中的语义偏差问题，在不依赖额外监督的情况下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: To identify objects beyond predefined categories, open-vocabulary aerial object detection (OVAD) leverages the zero-shot capabilities of visual-language models (VLMs) to generalize from base to novel categories. Existing approaches typically utilize self-learning mechanisms with weak text supervision to generate region-level pseudo-labels to align detectors with VLMs semantic spaces. However, text dependence induces semantic bias, restricting open-vocabulary expansion to text-specified concepts. We propose $\textbf{VK-Det}$, a $\textbf{V}$isual $\textbf{K}$nowledge-guided open-vocabulary object $\textbf{Det}$ection framework $\textit{without}$ extra supervision. First, we discover and leverage vision encoder's inherent informative region perception to attain fine-grained localization and adaptive distillation. Second, we introduce a novel prototype-aware pseudo-labeling strategy. It models inter-class decision boundaries through feature clustering and maps detection regions to latent categories via prototype matching. This enhances attention to novel objects while compensating for missing supervision. Extensive experiments show state-of-the-art performance, achieving 30.1 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DIOR and 23.3 $\mathrm{mAP}^{N}$ on DOTA, outperforming even extra supervised methods.

Conclusion: ActDistill为高效具身智能建立了一个通用范式，实现了动作导向的VLA模型效率优化。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown impressive flexibility and generalization, yet their deployment in robotic manipulation remains limited by heavy computational overhead and inference latency. In this work, we present ActDistill, a general action-guided self-derived distillation framework that transfers the action prediction capability of any existing VLA model to a lightweight counterpart. Unlike previous efficiency strategies that primarily emphasize vision-language correlations, ActDistill leverages action priors to guide knowledge transfer and model compression, achieving action-oriented efficiency for VLA models. Specifically, we employ a well-trained VLA model as the teacher and introduce a graph-structured encapsulation strategy to explicitly model the hierarchical evolution of action prediction. The student model, derived from the graph-encapsulated teacher, is further equipped with a dynamic router that adaptively selects computation paths based on action prediction demands, guided by hierarchical graph-informed supervision to ensure smooth and efficient evolution. During inference, graph-related auxiliary components are removed, allowing the student to execute only dynamically routed layers and predict high-precision actions with minimal computation and latency. Experiments on embodied benchmarks demonstrate that ActDistill achieves comparable or superior performance to full-scale VLA models while reducing computation by over 50% with up to 1.67 times speedup, thereby establishing a general paradigm toward efficient embodied intelligence.

Abstract: Background and Objective: Deep learning models have high computational needs and lack interpretability but are often the first choice for medical image classification tasks. This study addresses whether complex neural networks are essential for the simple binary classification task of malaria. We introduce the Extracted Morphological Feature Engineered (EMFE) pipeline, a transparent, reproducible, and low compute machine learning approach tailored explicitly for simple cell morphology, designed to achieve deep learning performance levels on a simple CPU only setup with the practical aim of real world deployment.
  Methods: The study used the NIH Malaria Cell Images dataset, with two features extracted from each cell image: the number of non background pixels and the number of holes within the cell. Logistic Regression and Random Forest were compared against ResNet18, DenseNet121, MobileNetV2, and EfficientNet across accuracy, model size, and CPU inference time. An ensemble model was created by combining Logistic Regression and Random Forests to achieve higher accuracy while retaining efficiency.
  Results: The single variable Logistic Regression model achieved a test accuracy of 94.80 percent with a file size of 1.2 kB and negligible inference latency (2.3 ms). The two stage ensemble improved accuracy to 97.15 percent. In contrast, the deep learning methods require 13.6 MB to 44.7 MB of storage and show significantly higher inference times (68 ms).
  Conclusion: This study shows that a compact feature engineering approach can produce clinically meaningful classification performance while offering gains in transparency, reproducibility, speed, and deployment feasibility. The proposed pipeline demonstrates that simple interpretable features paired with lightweight models can serve as a practical diagnostic solution for environments with limited computational resources.

TL;DR: SPD是一种几何原理驱动的去偏框架，通过识别和移除线性可解码偏见的整个子空间，同时重新插入中性均值分量来保持语义保真度，相比现有方法在公平性指标上平均提升18.5%。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的事后去偏方法仅替换最相关的嵌入坐标，但存在特征纠缠、跨数据集泛化差和去偏不完整三个关键问题。偏见并非局限于少数坐标，而是分布在几个线性子空间中。

Method: 提出子空间投影去偏(SPD)框架，识别并移除线性可解码偏见的整个子空间，同时重新插入中性均值分量以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在零样本分类、文本到图像检索和图像生成任务上的广泛实验验证了SPD的有效性：在四个公平性指标上平均提升18.5%，同时与最佳去偏基线相比任务性能损失最小。

Conclusion: SPD通过几何原理驱动的子空间投影方法，实现了更鲁棒的去偏效果，同时保持了任务性能，为视觉语言模型的公平性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become indispensable for multimodal reasoning, yet their representations often encode and amplify demographic biases, resulting in biased associations and misaligned predictions in downstream tasks. Such behavior undermines fairness and distorts the intended alignment between vision and language. Recent post-hoc approaches attempt to mitigate bias by replacing the most attribute-correlated embedding coordinates with neutral values. However, our systematic analysis reveals three critical failures of this coordinate-wise approach: feature entanglement, poor cross-dataset generalization, and incomplete bias removal. We find that bias is not localized to a few coordinates but is instead distributed across a few linear subspaces. To address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{S}$ubspace $\textbf{P}$rojection $\textbf{D}$ebiasing ($\textbf{SPD}$), a geometrically principled framework that identifies and removes the entire subspace of linearly decodable bias while reinserting a neutral mean component to preserve semantic fidelity. Extensive experiments across zero-shot classification, text-to-image retrieval, and image generation validate the effectiveness of SPD: our method achieves more robust debiasing with an average improvement of $18.5\%$ across four fairness metrics, while maintaining minimal loss in task performance compared to the best debiasing baseline.

Motivation: 现有方法过度强调跨模态对齐而忽视模态特异性，导致表示坍塌和多样性降低。需要同时考虑对齐和差异性来提升多模态生存分析性能。

Method: 提出Together-Then-Apart框架：Together阶段通过共享原型和不平衡最优传输对齐嵌入；Apart阶段通过模态锚点和对比正则化最大化表示多样性。

Result: 在五个TCGA基准测试中一致优于最先进方法，实现稳健、可解释且具有生物学意义的多模态生存分析。

Conclusion: TTA为多模态生存分析提供了新的理论视角，证明对齐和差异性可以联合实现，提升模型的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Integrating heterogeneous modalities such as histopathology and genomics is central to advancing survival analysis, yet most existing methods prioritize cross-modal alignment through attention-based fusion mechanisms, often at the expense of modality-specific characteristics. This overemphasis on alignment leads to representation collapse and reduced diversity. In this work, we revisit multi-modal survival analysis via the dual lens of alignment and distinctiveness, positing that preserving modality-specific structure is as vital as achieving semantic coherence. In this paper, we introduce Together-Then-Apart (TTA), a unified min-max optimization framework that simultaneously models shared and modality-specific representations. The Together stage minimizes semantic discrepancies by aligning embeddings via shared prototypes, guided by an unbalanced optimal transport objective that adaptively highlights informative tokens. The Apart stage maximizes representational diversity through modality anchors and a contrastive regularizer that preserve unique modality information and prevent feature collapse. Extensive experiments on five TCGA benchmarks show that TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Beyond empirical gains, our formulation provides a new theoretical perspective of how alignment and distinctiveness can be jointly achieved in for robust, interpretable, and biologically meaningful multi-modal survival analysis.

Method: 使用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）模型自动分析婴儿视角视频中的视觉-语言对齐，并通过人工判断验证CLIP对齐分数的有效性。

Result: 理想化的学习对齐时刻（如"看球"时球出现在儿童视野中）在儿童日常经验中相对罕见，且不同儿童之间存在对齐变异性。

Conclusion: 不频繁的对齐是早期词汇学习模型的约束条件，该方法为研究儿童多模态环境提供了新途径。

Abstract: Figuring out which objects or concepts words refer to is a central language learning challenge for young children. Most models of this process posit that children learn early object labels from co-occurrences of words and their referents that occur when someone around them talks about an object in the immediate physical environment. But how aligned in time are children's visual and linguistic experiences during everyday learning? To date, answers to this question have been limited by the need for labor-intensive manual annotations of vision-language co-occurrences. Here, we evaluate the use of contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) models to automatically characterize vision-language alignment in egocentric videos taken from the infant perspective in home environments. After validating CLIP alignment scores using human alignment judgments, we apply this metric to a large corpus of infant-perspective videos. We show that idealized aligned moments for learning (e.g., "look at the ball" with a ball present in the child's view) are relatively rare in children's everyday experiences compared to modern machine learning datasets, and highlight variability in alignment both within and across children. These findings suggest that infrequent alignment is a constraint for models describing early word learning and offer a new method for investigating children's multimodal environment.

Conclusion: VRPSR成功解决了感知超分辨率与重新压缩的联合优化问题，通过创新的编解码器模拟器和训练技术，显著提升了压缩效率，为实际应用中的图像处理流程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Perceptual image super-resolution (SR) methods restore degraded images and produce sharp outputs. In practice, those outputs are usually recompressed for storage and transmission. Ignoring recompression is suboptimal as the downstream codec might add additional artifacts to restored images. However, jointly optimizing SR and recompression is challenging, as the codecs are not differentiable and vary in configuration. In this paper, we present Versatile Recompression-Aware Perceptual Super-Resolution (VRPSR), which makes existing perceptual SR aware of versatile compression. First, we formulate compression as conditional text-to-image generation and utilize a pre-trained diffusion model to build a generalizable codec simulator. Next, we propose a set of training techniques tailored for perceptual SR, including optimizing the simulator using perceptual targets and adopting slightly compressed images as the training target. Empirically, our VRPSR saves more than 10\% bitrate based on Real-ESRGAN and S3Diff under H.264/H.265/H.266 compression. Besides, our VRPSR facilitates joint optimization of the SR and post-processing model after recompression.

Abstract: This paper introduces the retrieval-augmented framework for automatic fashion caption and hashtag generation, combining multi-garment detection, attribute reasoning, and Large Language Model (LLM) prompting. The system aims to produce visually grounded, descriptive, and stylistically interesting text for fashion imagery, overcoming the limitations of end-to-end captioners that have problems with attribute fidelity and domain generalization. The pipeline combines a YOLO-based detector for multi-garment localization, k-means clustering for dominant color extraction, and a CLIP-FAISS retrieval module for fabric and gender attribute inference based on a structured product index. These attributes, together with retrieved style examples, create a factual evidence pack that is used to guide an LLM to generate human-like captions and contextually rich hashtags. A fine-tuned BLIP model is used as a supervised baseline model for comparison. Experimental results show that the YOLO detector is able to obtain a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.71 for nine categories of garments. The RAG-LLM pipeline generates expressive attribute-aligned captions and achieves mean attribute coverage of 0.80 with full coverage at the 50% threshold in hashtag generation, whereas BLIP gives higher lexical overlap and lower generalization. The retrieval-augmented approach exhibits better factual grounding, less hallucination, and great potential for scalable deployment in various clothing domains. These results demonstrate the use of retrieval-augmented generation as an effective and interpretable paradigm for automated and visually grounded fashion content generation.

Method: 使用200个多样化文本提示和三种最先进的视频生成器生成600个视频，标注了1600多个细粒度错误，涵盖六种类型（运动、物理、提示遵循等）

Conclusion: 提出的任务为构建细粒度评估工具和更复杂的视频生成器奖励模型铺平了道路

Abstract: Current text-to-video models (T2V) can generate high-quality, temporally coherent, and visually realistic videos. Nonetheless, errors still often occur, and are more nuanced and local compared to the previous generation of T2V models. While current evaluation paradigms assess video models across diverse dimensions, they typically evaluate videos holistically without identifying when specific errors occur or describing their nature. We address this gap by introducing Spotlight, a novel task aimed at localizing and explaining video-generation errors. We generate 600 videos using 200 diverse textual prompts and three state-of-the-art video generators (Veo 3, Seedance, and LTX-2), and annotate over 1600 fine-grained errors across six types, including motion, physics, and prompt adherence. We observe that adherence and physics errors are predominant and persist across longer segments, whereas appearance-disappearance and body pose errors manifest in shorter segments. We then evaluate current VLMs on Spotlight and find that VLMs lag significantly behind humans in error identification and localization in videos. We propose inference-time strategies to probe the limits of current VLMs on our task, improving performance by nearly 2x. Our task paves a way forward to building fine-grained evaluation tools and more sophisticated reward models for video generators.

Abstract: The proliferation of videos generated by diffusion models has raised increasing concerns about information security, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection of synthetic media. Existing methods primarily focus on image-level forgery detection, leaving generic video-level forgery detection largely underexplored. To advance video forensics, we propose a consolidated multimodal detection algorithm, named MM-Det++, specifically designed for detecting diffusion-generated videos. Our approach consists of two innovative branches and a Unified Multimodal Learning (UML) module. Specifically, the Spatio-Temporal (ST) branch employs a novel Frame-Centric Vision Transformer (FC-ViT) to aggregate spatio-temporal information for detecting diffusion-generated videos, where the FC-tokens enable the capture of holistic forgery traces from each video frame. In parallel, the Multimodal (MM) branch adopts a learnable reasoning paradigm to acquire Multimodal Forgery Representation (MFR) by harnessing the powerful comprehension and reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which discerns the forgery traces from a flexible semantic perspective. To integrate multimodal representations into a coherent space, a UML module is introduced to consolidate the generalization ability of MM-Det++. In addition, we also establish a large-scale and comprehensive Diffusion Video Forensics (DVF) dataset to advance research in video forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MM-Det++ and highlight the effectiveness of unified multimodal forgery learning in detecting diffusion-generated videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCU-Bridge框架提出人类视觉内涵理解的层次结构，从基础感知到语义桥接再到抽象内涵，并构建HVCU-Bench基准进行诊断评估。实验显示模型性能随推理层级提升而下降，通过MCTS引导的数据增强可显著提升模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在基准测试中表现优异，但其处理范式与人类整合视觉信息的能力不同。模型倾向于孤立处理细节和高级概念，而评估协议也往往将低级感知与高级推理解耦，忽略了它们的语义和因果依赖关系。

Method: 提出VCU-Bridge框架，构建人类视觉内涵理解的层次结构：从基础感知→语义桥接→抽象内涵，具有从具体线索到抽象结论的明确证据-推理轨迹。基于此构建HVCU-Bench基准，并开发基于蒙特卡洛树搜索的数据生成管道进行指令调优。

Result: 实验显示模型性能随推理层级提升而一致下降。通过强化低级能力，在高级推理上获得可测量的提升，不仅在HVCU-Bench上表现更好，在通用基准测试上也有平均+2.53%的提升，特别是在MMStar上获得+7.26%的显著提升。

Conclusion: 分层思维模式对增强多模态大语言模型能力具有重要意义，通过强化低级视觉能力可以有效提升高级推理性能，证明了视觉内涵理解层次框架的有效性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmarks, their processing paradigm differs from the human ability to integrate visual information. Unlike humans who naturally bridge details and high-level concepts, models tend to treat these elements in isolation. Prevailing evaluation protocols often decouple low-level perception from high-level reasoning, overlooking their semantic and causal dependencies, which yields non-diagnostic results and obscures performance bottlenecks. We present VCU-Bridge, a framework that operationalizes a human-like hierarchy of visual connotation understanding: multi-level reasoning that advances from foundational perception through semantic bridging to abstract connotation, with an explicit evidence-to-inference trace from concrete cues to abstract conclusions. Building on this framework, we construct HVCU-Bench, a benchmark for hierarchical visual connotation understanding with explicit, level-wise diagnostics. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate a consistent decline in performance as reasoning progresses to higher levels. We further develop a data generation pipeline for instruction tuning guided by Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and show that strengthening low-level capabilities yields measurable gains at higher levels. Interestingly, it not only improves on HVCU-Bench but also brings benefits on general benchmarks (average +2.53%), especially with substantial gains on MMStar (+7.26%), demonstrating the significance of the hierarchical thinking pattern and its effectiveness in enhancing MLLM capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaPerceiver是首个在深度、宽度和token维度上实现统一自适应性的transformer架构，能够在单模型中动态调整计算资源以适应不同硬件和延迟约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代transformer架构在推理时计算分配方式固定，难以适应多样化的硬件和延迟约束。现有动态计算方法通常只关注单一维度（如减少token数量），缺乏统一的自适应能力。

Method: 提出支持深度、宽度和token维度自适应性的架构，配合高效的联合训练机制确保模型在各种配置下保持性能。

Result: 在图像分类任务中，AdaPerceiver扩展了精度-吞吐量帕累托前沿，达到85.4%准确率且吞吐量比FlexiViT-L高36%。在密集预测任务中，匹配ViT-H/14性能的同时语义分割和深度估计的编码器FLOPs减少约26倍。配备策略后可在保持ImageNet1K准确率（±0.1%）的同时减少24-33%的FLOPs。

Conclusion: AdaPerceiver通过统一的多维度自适应性，为transformer模型提供了灵活的计算资源分配能力，显著提升了模型在不同硬件约束下的部署效率。

Abstract: Modern transformer architectures achieve remarkable performance across tasks and domains but remain rigid in how they allocate computation at inference time. Real-world deployment often requires models to adapt to diverse hardware and latency constraints, yet most approaches to dynamic computation focus on a single axis -- such as reducing the number of tokens. We present a novel capability: AdaPerceiver, the first transformer architecture with unified adaptivity across depth, width, and tokens within a single model. We propose an architecture that supports adaptivity along these axes. We couple this with an efficient joint training regime that ensures the model maintains performance across its various configurations. We evaluate AdaPerceiver on image classification, semantic segmentation, and depth estimation tasks. On image classification, AdaPerceiver expands the accuracy-throughput Pareto front. It achieves 85.4% accuracy while yielding 36% higher throughput than FlexiViT-L. On dense prediction, AdaPerceiver matches ViT-H/14 while having $\sim$26x fewer encoder FLOPs (floating-point operations) on semantic segmentation and depth estimation. Finally, we show how AdaPerceiver equipped with a policy can maintain ImageNet1K accuracy ($\pm0.1$ percentage points) while reducing FLOPs by $24-33$%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Muskie是一个原生多视角视觉骨干网络，专为3D视觉任务设计。它通过同时处理多个视角并引入多视角一致性预训练，在无3D监督的情况下学习视角不变特征和几何理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型是逐帧处理的，多视角一致性有限，需要设计能够同时处理多个视角并确保多视角一致性的骨干网络。

Method: 通过重构一个视角中被严重遮挡的内容，利用其他视角的几何对应关系进行预训练，采用激进的遮挡策略。

Result: 相比DINO等最先进的逐帧骨干网络，Muskie实现了更高的多视角对应精度，并在相机姿态估计和点云重建等下游3D任务中持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Muskie通过多视角一致性预训练成功学习了视角不变特征和几何理解，在3D视觉任务中表现出色。

Abstract: We present Muskie, a native multi-view vision backbone designed for 3D vision tasks. Unlike existing models, which are frame-wise and exhibit limited multi-view consistency, Muskie is designed to process multiple views simultaneously and introduce multi-view consistency in pre-training stage. Muskie is trained to reconstruct heavily masked content in one view by finding and utilizing geometric correspondences from other views. Through this pretext task and our proposed aggressive masking strategy, the model implicitly to learn view-invariant features and develop strong geometric understanding without any 3D supervision. Compared with state-of-the-art frame-wise backbones such as DINO, Muskie achieves higher multi-view correspondence accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that using Muskie as a backbone consistently enhances performance on downstream 3D tasks, including camera pose estimation and pointmap reconstruction.

TL;DR: SCALER是一个统一的协作框架，通过联合优化均值教师分割器和可学习的SAM，在标签稀缺的隐蔽目标分割任务中实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在标签稀缺的隐蔽目标分割中性能有限，研究探索如何将一致性约束和SAM监督联合集成，并实现分割器与SAM的相互指导。

Method: 采用两阶段交替优化：阶段I在固定SAM监督下优化分割器，使用基于熵的图像级和基于不确定性的像素级加权；阶段II通过增强不变性和噪声抵抗损失更新SAM。

Result: 在8个半监督和弱监督COS任务中取得一致的性能提升，证明SCALER可作为通用训练范式增强轻量分割器和大型基础模型。

Conclusion: SCALER框架有效解决了标签稀缺隐蔽目标分割问题，通过分割器与SAM的协同学习实现了相互提升，在多种监督设置下均表现出色。

Abstract: Existing methods for label-deficient concealed object segmentation (LDCOS) either rely on consistency constraints or Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based pseudo-labeling. However, their performance remains limited due to the intrinsic concealment of targets and the scarcity of annotations. This study investigates two key questions: (1) Can consistency constraints and SAM-based supervision be jointly integrated to better exploit complementary information and enhance the segmenter? and (2) beyond that, can the segmenter in turn guide SAM through reciprocal supervision, enabling mutual improvement? To answer these questions, we present SCALER, a unified collaborative framework toward LDCOS that jointly optimizes a mean-teacher segmenter and a learnable SAM. SCALER operates in two alternating phases. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral1}}, the segmenter is optimized under fixed SAM supervision using entropy-based image-level and uncertainty-based pixel-level weighting to select reliable pseudo-label regions and emphasize harder examples. In \textbf{Phase \uppercase\expandafter{\romannumeral2}}, SAM is updated via augmentation invariance and noise resistance losses, leveraging its inherent robustness to perturbations. Experiments demonstrate that SCALER yields consistent performance gains across eight semi- and weakly-supervised COS tasks. The results further suggest that SCALER can serve as a general training paradigm to enhance both lightweight segmenters and large foundation models under label-scarce conditions. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的零样本异常检测方法受限于提示工程策略，存在表示瓶颈和过拟合问题，难以泛化到复杂多样的未见异常

Method: 学习专家提示池作为可组合语义基元，通过视觉引导的混合专家机制动态组合这些提示，生成语义丰富的文本表示

Result: 在工业和医疗领域的15个数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性和最先进性能

Conclusion: PromptMoE通过组合式提示学习方法解决了零样本异常检测的泛化问题，取得了state-of-the-art性能

Abstract: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) aims to identify and localize anomalous regions in images of unseen object classes. While recent methods based on vision-language models like CLIP show promise, their performance is constrained by existing prompt engineering strategies. Current approaches, whether relying on single fixed, learnable, or dense dynamic prompts, suffer from a representational bottleneck and are prone to overfitting on auxiliary data, failing to generalize to the complexity and diversity of unseen anomalies. To overcome these limitations, we propose $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$. Our core insight is that robust ZSAD requires a compositional approach to prompt learning. Instead of learning monolithic prompts, $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$ learns a pool of expert prompts, which serve as a basis set of composable semantic primitives, and a visually-guided Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically combine them for each instance. Our framework materializes this concept through a Visually-Guided Mixture of Prompt (VGMoP) that employs an image-gated sparse MoE to aggregate diverse normal and abnormal expert state prompts, generating semantically rich textual representations with strong generalization. Extensive experiments across 15 datasets in industrial and medical domains demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of $\mathtt{PromptMoE}$.

TL;DR: 提出UnfoldLDM方法，将深度展开网络与潜在扩散模型结合，解决盲图像恢复中的退化特定依赖和过度平滑偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络存在两个主要问题：(1) 退化特定依赖，其优化框架依赖于已知的退化模型，不适用于盲图像恢复；(2) 过度平滑偏差，梯度下降输出直接馈入近端项，抑制了精细纹理。

Method: 提出UnfoldLDM框架，包含多粒度退化感知模块作为梯度下降步骤，建模盲图像恢复为未知退化估计问题；设计退化抵抗潜在扩散模型提取紧凑的退化不变先验；使用过度平滑校正变换器显式恢复高频分量。

Result: 实验表明UnfoldLDM在各种盲图像恢复任务上达到领先水平，并能提升下游任务性能，且与现有深度展开网络方法兼容，可作为即插即用框架。

Conclusion: UnfoldLDM成功解决了深度展开网络在盲图像恢复中的局限性，通过结合潜在扩散模型实现了退化无关且视觉丰富的恢复效果。

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) combine the interpretability of model-based methods with the learning ability of deep networks, yet remain limited for blind image restoration (BIR). Existing DUNs suffer from: (1) \textbf{Degradation-specific dependency}, as their optimization frameworks are tied to a known degradation model, making them unsuitable for BIR tasks; and (2) \textbf{Over-smoothing bias}, resulting from the direct feeding of gradient descent outputs, dominated by low-frequency content, into the proximal term, suppressing fine textures. To overcome these issues, we propose UnfoldLDM to integrate DUNs with latent diffusion model (LDM) for BIR. In each stage, UnfoldLDM employs a multi-granularity degradation-aware (MGDA) module as the gradient descent step. MGDA models BIR as an unknown degradation estimation problem and estimates both the holistic degradation matrix and its decomposed forms, enabling robust degradation removal. For the proximal step, we design a degradation-resistant LDM (DR-LDM) to extract compact degradation-invariant priors from the MGDA output. Guided by this prior, an over-smoothing correction transformer (OCFormer) explicitly recovers high-frequency components and enhances texture details. This unique combination ensures the final result is degradation-free and visually rich. Experiments show that our UnfoldLDM achieves a leading place on various BIR tasks and benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, our design is compatible with existing DUN-based methods, serving as a plug-and-play framework. Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型多视角立体视觉方法在泛化能力上存在不足，而优化型方法虽然能进行场景特定适应但缺乏可扩展性且需要昂贵的逐场景优化。

Method: 使用自监督的跨视角一致性损失作为辅助任务来指导推理时自适应，并引入元辅助学习策略来训练模型从基于辅助任务的更新中受益。

Result: 在标准数据集和跨数据集泛化设置上的实验表明，MVS-TTA能持续提升性能，即使应用于最先进的多视角立体视觉模型。

Conclusion: 这是首次使用元学习将基于优化的测试时自适应集成到学习型多视角立体视觉中的尝试，该框架具有模型无关性且只需最小架构改动。

Abstract: Recent learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods are data-driven and have achieved remarkable progress due to large-scale training data and advanced architectures. However, their generalization remains sub-optimal due to fixed model parameters trained on limited training data distributions. In contrast, optimization-based methods enable scene-specific adaptation but lack scalability and require costly per-scene optimization. In this paper, we propose MVS-TTA, an efficient test-time adaptation (TTA) framework that enhances the adaptability of learning-based MVS methods by bridging these two paradigms. Specifically, MVS-TTA employs a self-supervised, cross-view consistency loss as an auxiliary task to guide inference-time adaptation. We introduce a meta-auxiliary learning strategy to train the model to benefit from auxiliary-task-based updates explicitly. Our framework is model-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of MVS methods with minimal architectural changes. Extensive experiments on standard datasets (DTU, BlendedMVS) and a challenging cross-dataset generalization setting demonstrate that MVS-TTA consistently improves performance, even when applied to state-of-the-art MVS models. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to integrate optimization-based test-time adaptation into learning-based MVS using meta-learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于展开网络的隐蔽目标分割方法将背景估计与图像恢复耦合，导致目标冲突且需要预定义退化类型，这在真实场景中不现实。

Method: 采用DUN-in-DUN设计，在分割导向展开网络(SODUN)的每个阶段嵌入抗退化展开网络(DeRUN)，使用视觉语言模型动态推断退化语义并恢复高质量图像，同时通过图像质量评估选择最佳输出。

Result: 在干净和退化的基准测试中取得了领先性能。

Conclusion: NUN框架有效解决了真实世界隐蔽目标分割中恢复与分割的耦合问题，无需显式先验即可实现鲁棒分割。

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have recently advanced concealed object segmentation (COS) by modeling segmentation as iterative foreground-background separation. However, existing DUN-based methods (RUN) inherently couple background estimation with image restoration, leading to conflicting objectives and requiring pre-defined degradation types, which are unrealistic in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose the nested unfolding network (NUN), a unified framework for real-world COS. NUN adopts a DUN-in-DUN design, embedding a degradation-resistant unfolding network (DeRUN) within each stage of a segmentation-oriented unfolding network (SODUN). This design decouples restoration from segmentation while allowing mutual refinement. Guided by a vision-language model (VLM), DeRUN dynamically infers degradation semantics and restores high-quality images without explicit priors, whereas SODUN performs reversible estimation to refine foreground and background. Leveraging the multi-stage nature of unfolding, NUN employs image-quality assessment to select the best DeRUN outputs for subsequent stages, naturally introducing a self-consistency loss that enhances robustness. Extensive experiments show that NUN achieves a leading place on both clean and degraded benchmarks. Code will be released.

TL;DR: ARIAL是一个模块化框架，通过LLM规划代理协调专用工具，在文档视觉问答中同时实现精确答案提取和可靠空间定位，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档VQA系统要么在文本准确性上表现良好但空间定位不可靠，要么为了可解释性而牺牲性能。需要一种既能精确提取答案又能可靠定位的方法。

Method: 将文档VQA分解为结构化子任务：TrOCR文本提取、语义搜索增强的上下文选择、Gemma 3-27B答案生成、文本到区域对齐的边界框定位，通过LLM代理协调这些模块。

Result: 在四个基准测试中取得最先进结果：DocVQA（88.7 ANLS和50.1 mAP）、FUNSD（90.0 ANLS和50.3 mAP）、CORD（85.5 ANLS和60.2 mAP）、SROIE（93.1 ANLS），相比之前最佳方法DLaVA在DocVQA上提升+2.8 ANLS和+3.9 mAP。

Conclusion: 专用工具的智能协调可以同时提高性能和可解释性，为可信赖、可解释的文档AI系统提供了路径。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (VQA) requires models to not only extract accurate textual answers but also precisely localize them within document images, a capability critical for interpretability in high-stakes applications. However, existing systems achieve strong textual accuracy while producing unreliable spatial grounding, or sacrifice performance for interpretability. We present ARIAL (Agentic Reasoning for Interpretable Answer Localization), a modular framework that orchestrates specialized tools through an LLM-based planning agent to achieve both precise answer extraction and reliable spatial grounding. ARIAL decomposes Document VQA into structured subtasks: OCR-based text extraction with TrOCR, retrieval-augmented context selection using semantic search, answer generation via a fine-tuned Gemma 3-27B model, and explicit bounding-box localization through text-to-region alignment. This modular architecture produces transparent reasoning traces, enabling tool-level auditability and independent component optimization. We evaluate ARIAL on four benchmarks (DocVQA, FUNSD, CORD, and SROIE) using both textual accuracy (ANLS) and spatial precision (mAP at IoU 0.50 to 0.95). ARIAL achieves state-of-the-art results across all datasets: 88.7 ANLS and 50.1 mAP on DocVQA, 90.0 ANLS and 50.3 mAP on FUNSD, 85.5 ANLS and 60.2 mAP on CORD, and 93.1 ANLS on SROIE, surpassing the previous best method (DLaVA) by +2.8 ANLS and +3.9 mAP on DocVQA. Our work demonstrates how agentic orchestration of specialized tools can simultaneously improve performance and interpretability, providing a pathway toward trustworthy, explainable document AI systems.

Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注组合对齐或单轮VQA评分，对知识基础、多物理交互和可审计证据等关键维度测试不足。

Method: 提出PicWorld基准和PW-Agent评估器，将提示分解为可验证的视觉证据，分层评估图像的物理真实性和逻辑一致性。

Result: 对17个主流T2I模型的分析显示，它们在隐含世界知识和物理因果推理能力上普遍存在根本性限制。

Conclusion: 未来的T2I系统需要具备推理感知和知识集成的架构。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models today are capable of producing photorealistic, instruction-following images, yet they still frequently fail on prompts that require implicit world knowledge. Existing evaluation protocols either emphasize compositional alignment or rely on single-round VQA-based scoring, leaving critical dimensions such as knowledge grounding, multi-physics interactions, and auditable evidence-substantially undertested. To address these limitations, we introduce PicWorld, the first comprehensive benchmark that assesses the grasp of implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning of T2I models. This benchmark consists of 1,100 prompts across three core categories. To facilitate fine-grained evaluation, we propose PW-Agent, an evidence-grounded multi-agent evaluator to hierarchically assess images on their physical realism and logical consistency by decomposing prompts into verifiable visual evidence. We conduct a thorough analysis of 17 mainstream T2I models on PicWorld, illustrating that they universally exhibit a fundamental limitation in their capacity for implicit world knowledge and physical causal reasoning to varying degrees. The findings highlight the need for reasoning-aware, knowledge-integrative architectures in future T2I systems.

Conclusion: SFHand为实时人机交互应用提供了有效的语言引导3D手部预测解决方案，同时构建了首个大规模同步3D手部姿态和语言指令数据集EgoHaFL。

Abstract: Real-time 3D hand forecasting is a critical component for fluid human-computer interaction in applications like AR and assistive robotics. However, existing methods are ill-suited for these scenarios, as they typically require offline access to accumulated video sequences and cannot incorporate language guidance that conveys task intent. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SFHand, the first streaming framework for language-guided 3D hand forecasting. SFHand autoregressively predicts a comprehensive set of future 3D hand states, including hand type, 2D bounding box, 3D pose, and trajectory, from a continuous stream of video and language instructions. Our framework combines a streaming autoregressive architecture with an ROI-enhanced memory layer, capturing temporal context while focusing on salient hand-centric regions. To enable this research, we also introduce EgoHaFL, the first large-scale dataset featuring synchronized 3D hand poses and language instructions. We demonstrate that SFHand achieves new state-of-the-art results in 3D hand forecasting, outperforming prior work by a significant margin of up to 35.8%. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of our learned representations by transferring them to downstream embodied manipulation tasks, improving task success rates by up to 13.4% on multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: Uni-DAD是一个单阶段训练框架，统一了扩散模型的蒸馏和适应过程，通过双域分布匹配蒸馏和多头GAN损失实现快速高质量的新域生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要两阶段训练（先适应后蒸馏或先蒸馏后适应），增加了设计复杂性并导致质量或多样性下降，需要一种单阶段解决方案。

Method: 结合双域分布匹配蒸馏目标（引导学生模型同时学习源域教师和目标域教师的分布）和多头GAN损失（在多个特征尺度上增强目标域的真实性）。

Result: 在少样本图像生成和主题驱动个性化任务中，Uni-DAD在少于4个采样步骤的情况下质量优于现有方法，在质量和多样性上都优于两阶段训练流程。

Conclusion: Uni-DAD提供了一个有效的单阶段解决方案，能够快速适应新域并保持高质量生成，特别适用于少样本场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) produce high-quality images, yet their sampling remains costly when adapted to new domains. Distilled DMs are faster but typically remain confined within their teacher's domain. Thus, fast and high-quality generation for novel domains relies on two-stage training pipelines: Adapt-then-Distill or Distill-then-Adapt. However, both add design complexity and suffer from degraded quality or diversity. We introduce Uni-DAD, a single-stage pipeline that unifies distillation and adaptation of DMs. It couples two signals during training: (i) a dual-domain distribution-matching distillation objective that guides the student toward the distributions of the source teacher and a target teacher, and (ii) a multi-head generative adversarial network (GAN) loss that encourages target realism across multiple feature scales. The source domain distillation preserves diverse source knowledge, while the multi-head GAN stabilizes training and reduces overfitting, especially in few-shot regimes. The inclusion of a target teacher facilitates adaptation to more structurally distant domains. We perform evaluations on a variety of datasets for few-shot image generation (FSIG) and subject-driven personalization (SDP). Uni-DAD delivers higher quality than state-of-the-art (SoTA) adaptation methods even with less than 4 sampling steps, and outperforms two-stage training pipelines in both quality and diversity.

Result: 该方法在仅使用主流编辑模型所需监督数据约1%的情况下，匹配了领先开源基线的性能。

Conclusion: 通过时间建模视角，成功实现了高效的指令驱动图像编辑，显著降低了数据需求。

Abstract: We observe that recent advances in multimodal foundation models have propelled instruction-driven image generation and editing into a genuinely cross-modal, cooperative regime. Nevertheless, state-of-the-art editing pipelines remain costly: beyond training large diffusion/flow models, they require curating massive high-quality triplets of \{instruction, source image, edited image\} to cover diverse user intents. Moreover, the fidelity of visual replacements hinges on how precisely the instruction references the target semantics. We revisit this challenge through the lens of temporal modeling: if video can be regarded as a full temporal process, then image editing can be seen as a degenerate temporal process. This perspective allows us to transfer single-frame evolution priors from video pre-training, enabling a highly data-efficient fine-tuning regime. Empirically, our approach matches the performance of leading open-source baselines while using only about one percent of the supervision demanded by mainstream editing models.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes is a fundamental task in 3D perception, but the inherent trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. Existing methods either prioritize speed and produce low-quality results, or achieve high-quality reconstruction at the cost of slow inference times. In this paper, we propose SwiftVGGT, a training-free method that significantly reduce inference time while preserving high-quality dense 3D reconstruction. To maintain global consistency in large-scale scenes, SwiftVGGT performs loop closure without relying on the external Visual Place Recognition (VPR) model. This removes redundant computation and enables accurate reconstruction over kilometer-scale environments. Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective point sampling method to align neighboring chunks using a single Sim(3)-based Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) step. This eliminates the need for the Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) optimization commonly used in prior work, leading to substantial speed-ups. We evaluate SwiftVGGT on multiple datasets and show that it achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while requiring only 33% of the inference time of recent VGGT-based large-scale reconstruction approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉书写者的全局风格模式（如倾斜度、曲率、笔画压力等），特别是在长距离空间依赖关系方面存在局限。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer风格编码器从多张参考图像学习全局风格模式，通过交叉注意力机制将风格线索与目标文本整合，并采用显著笔画注意力分析提高可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架在手写风格合成方面实现了更高的风格一致性和可解释性，为手写生成提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Styled handwriting generation aims to synthesize handwritten text that looks both realistic and aligned with a specific writer's style. While recent approaches involving GAN, transformer and diffusion-based models have made progress, they often struggle to capture the full spectrum of writer-specific attributes, particularly global stylistic patterns that span long-range spatial dependencies. As a result, capturing subtle writer-specific traits such as consistent slant, curvature or stroke pressure, while keeping the generated text accurate is still an open problem. In this work, we present a unified framework designed to address these limitations. We introduce a Vision Transformer-based style encoder that learns global stylistic patterns from multiple reference images, allowing the model to better represent long-range structural characteristics of handwriting. We then integrate these style cues with the target text using a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the system to produce handwritten images that more faithfully reflect the intended style. To make the process more interpretable, we utilize Salient Stroke Attention Analysis (SSAA), which reveals the stroke-level features the model focuses on during style transfer. Together, these components lead to handwriting synthesis that is not only more stylistically coherent, but also easier to understand and analyze.

Abstract: Astronomical imaging confronts an efficiency-resolution tradeoff that limits large-scale morphological classification and redshift prediction. We introduce WaveletMamba, a theory-driven framework integrating wavelet decomposition with state-space modeling, mathematical regularization, and multi-level bias correction. WaveletMamba achieves 81.72% +/- 0.53% classification accuracy at 64x64 resolution with only 3.54M parameters, delivering high-resolution performance (80.93% +/- 0.27% at 244x244) at low-resolution inputs with 9.7x computational efficiency gains. The framework exhibits Resolution Multistability, where models trained on low-resolution data achieve consistent accuracy across different input scales despite divergent internal representations. The framework's multi-level bias correction synergizes HK distance (distribution-level optimal transport) with Color-Aware Weighting (sample-level fine-tuning), achieving 22.96% Log-MSE improvement and 26.10% outlier reduction without explicit selection function modeling. Here, we show that mathematical rigor enables unprecedented efficiency and comprehensive bias correction in scientific AI, bridging computer vision and astrophysics to revolutionize interdisciplinary scientific discovery.

Method: 系统评估三种预训练CNN架构：RadImageNet DenseNet121（医学领域预训练）、EfficientNetV2S和ConvNeXt-Tiny（通用预训练），在相同条件下使用有限脑MRI数据集进行训练和微调

Result: ConvNeXt-Tiny准确率最高，其次是EfficientNetV2S，而RadImageNet DenseNet121尽管有医学领域预训练，但表现出较差的泛化能力，准确率较低且损失较高

Conclusion: 在小数据条件下，医学领域特定预训练可能泛化能力不佳，而现代深度通用预训练CNN在大规模数据集上预训练后，在专业医学成像任务中能提供更优越的迁移学习性能

Abstract: Brain tumor detection from MRI scans plays a crucial role in early diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated strong performance in medical imaging tasks, particularly when pretrained on large datasets. However, it remains unclear which type of pretrained model performs better when only a small dataset is available: those trained on domain-specific medical data or those pretrained on large general datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluate three pretrained CNN architectures for brain tumor classification: RadImageNet DenseNet121 with medical-domain pretraining, EfficientNetV2S, and ConvNeXt-Tiny, which are modern general-purpose CNNs. All models were trained and fine-tuned under identical conditions using a limited-size brain MRI dataset to ensure a fair comparison. Our results reveal that ConvNeXt-Tiny achieved the highest accuracy, followed by EfficientNetV2S, while RadImageNet DenseNet121, despite being pretrained on domain-specific medical data, exhibited poor generalization with lower accuracy and higher loss. These findings suggest that domain-specific pretraining may not generalize well under small-data conditions. In contrast, modern, deeper general-purpose CNNs pretrained on large-scale datasets can offer superior transfer learning performance in specialized medical imaging tasks.

Abstract: Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) models achieve strong performance in segmenting novel classes with minimal labeled examples, yet their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. While explainable AI has advanced significantly in standard computer vision tasks, interpretability in FSS remains virtually unexplored despite its critical importance for understanding model behavior and guiding support set selection in data-scarce scenarios. This paper introduces the first dedicated method for interpreting matching-based FSS models by leveraging their inherent structural properties. Our Affinity Explainer approach extracts attribution maps that highlight which pixels in support images contribute most to query segmentation predictions, using matching scores computed between support and query features at multiple feature levels. We extend standard interpretability evaluation metrics to the FSS domain and propose additional metrics to better capture the practical utility of explanations in few-shot scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on FSS benchmark datasets, using different models, demonstrate that our Affinity Explainer significantly outperforms adapted standard attribution methods. Qualitative analysis reveals that our explanations provide structured, coherent attention patterns that align with model architectures and and enable effective model diagnosis. This work establishes the foundation for interpretable FSS research, enabling better model understanding and diagnostic for more reliable few-shot segmentation systems.

Abstract: Automatic X-ray prohibited items detection is vital for security inspection and has been widely studied. Traditional methods rely on visual modality, often struggling with complex threats. While recent studies incorporate language to guide single-view images, human inspectors typically use dual-view images in practice. This raises the question: can the second view provide constraints similar to a language modality? In this work, we introduce DualXrayBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for X-ray inspection that includes multiple views and modalities. It supports eight tasks designed to test cross-view reasoning. In DualXrayBench, we introduce a caption corpus consisting of 45,613 dual-view image pairs across 12 categories with corresponding captions. Building upon these data, we propose the Geometric (cross-view)-Semantic (cross-modality) Reasoner (GSR), a multimodal model that jointly learns correspondences between cross-view geometry and cross-modal semantics, treating the second-view images as a "language-like modality". To enable this, we construct the GSXray dataset, with structured Chain-of-Thought sequences: <top>, <side>, <conclusion>. Comprehensive evaluations on DualXrayBench demonstrate that GSR achieves significant improvements across all X-ray tasks, offering a new perspective for real-world X-ray inspection.

Abstract: Egocentric video generation with fine-grained control through body motion is a key requirement towards embodied AI agents that can simulate, predict, and plan actions. In this work, we propose EgoControl, a pose-controllable video diffusion model trained on egocentric data. We train a video prediction model to condition future frame generation on explicit 3D body pose sequences. To achieve precise motion control, we introduce a novel pose representation that captures both global camera dynamics and articulated body movements, and integrate it through a dedicated control mechanism within the diffusion process. Given a short sequence of observed frames and a sequence of target poses, EgoControl generates temporally coherent and visually realistic future frames that align with the provided pose control. Experimental results demonstrate that EgoControl produces high-quality, pose-consistent egocentric videos, paving the way toward controllable embodied video simulation and understanding.

TL;DR: USF是一个统一的球形前端框架，可将任意校准相机的图像转换为单位球面表示，直接在空间域执行球形重采样、卷积和池化操作，解决了宽视场相机中平面CNN的局限性。

Conclusion: USF框架有效解决了宽视场相机感知中的几何失配问题，提供旋转等变性，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern perception increasingly relies on fisheye, panoramic, and other wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, yet most pipelines still apply planar CNNs designed for pinhole imagery on 2D grids, where image-space neighborhoods misrepresent physical adjacency and models are sensitive to global rotations. Frequency-domain spherical CNNs partially address this mismatch but require costly spherical harmonic transforms that constrain resolution and efficiency. We introduce the Unified Spherical Frontend (USF), a lens-agnostic framework that transforms images from any calibrated camera into a unit-sphere representation via ray-direction correspondences, and performs spherical resampling, convolution, and pooling directly in the spatial domain. USF is modular: projection, location sampling, interpolation, and resolution control are fully decoupled. Its distance-only spherical kernels offer configurable rotation-equivariance (mirroring translation-equivariance in planar CNNs) while avoiding harmonic transforms entirely. We compare standard planar backbones with their spherical counterparts across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks on synthetic (Spherical MNIST) and real-world datasets (PANDORA, Stanford 2D-3D-S), and stress-test robustness to extreme lens distortions, varying FoV, and arbitrary rotations. USF processes high-resolution spherical imagery efficiently and maintains less than 1% performance drop under random test-time rotations, even without rotational augmentation, and even enables zero-shot generalization from one lens type to unseen wide-FoV lenses with minimal performance degradation.

Conclusion: CorrFlowNet方法具有改善癌症诊断的潜力，能够通过生成虚拟随访扫描实现早期检测，减少对临床随访的依赖。

Abstract: Lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers, and early diagnosis is critical because the survival rate declines sharply once the disease progresses to advanced stages. However, achieving an early diagnosis remains challenging, particularly in distinguishing subtle early signals of malignancy from those of benign conditions. In clinical practice, a patient with a high risk may need to undergo an initial baseline and several annual follow-up examinations (e.g., CT scans) before receiving a definitive diagnosis, which can result in missing the optimal treatment. Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods have been increasingly used for early diagnosis of lung cancer, but most existing algorithms focus on radiomic features extraction from single early-stage CT scans. Inspired by recent advances in diffusion models for image generation, this paper proposes a generative method, named CorrFlowNet, which creates a virtual, one-year follow-up CT scan after the initial baseline scan. This virtual follow-up would allow for an early detection of malignant/benign nodules, reducing the need to wait for clinical follow-ups. During training, our approach employs a correlational autoencoder to encode both early baseline and follow-up CT images into a latent space that captures the dynamics of nodule progression as well as the correlations between them, followed by a flow matching algorithm on the latent space with a neural ordinary differential equation. An auxiliary classifier is used to further enhance the diagnostic accuracy. Evaluations on a real clinical dataset show our method can significantly improve downstream lung nodule risk assessment compared with existing baseline models. Moreover, its diagnostic accuracy is comparable with real clinical CT follow-ups, highlighting its potential to improve cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: The advent of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has unlocked the potential for end-to-end document parsing and translation. However, prevailing benchmarks such as OmniDocBench and DITrans are dominated by pristine scanned or digital-born documents, and thus fail to adequately represent the intricate challenges of real-world capture conditions, such as geometric distortions and photometric variations. To fill this gap, we introduce DocPTBench, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for Photographed Document Parsing and Translation. DocPTBench comprises over 1,300 high-resolution photographed documents from multiple domains, includes eight translation scenarios, and provides meticulously human-verified annotations for both parsing and translation. Our experiments demonstrate that transitioning from digital-born to photographed documents results in a substantial performance decline: popular MLLMs exhibit an average accuracy drop of 18% in end-to-end parsing and 12% in translation, while specialized document parsing models show significant average decrease of 25%. This substantial performance gap underscores the unique challenges posed by documents captured in real-world conditions and reveals the limited robustness of existing models.

Conclusion: 成功开发出兼具高精度和视觉可解释性的双模块临床辅助解决方案，为IVF胚胎质量评估提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: The degree of embryo fragmentation serves as a critical morphological indicator for assessing embryo developmental potential in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) clinical decision-making. However, current manual grading processes are not only time-consuming but also limited by significant inter-observer variability and efficiency bottlenecks. Although deep learning has demonstrated potential in automated grading in recent years, existing solutions face a significant challenge: pure regression models lack the visual explainability required for clinical practice, while pure segmentation models struggle to directly translate pixel-level masks into precise clinical grades. This study proposes RegDeepLab, a dual-branch Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework that integrates State-of-the-Art (SOTA) semantic segmentation (DeepLabV3+) with a multi-scale regression head. Addressing the common issues of "Gradient Conflict" and "Negative Transfer" in multi-task training, we propose a "Two-Stage Decoupled Training Strategy." Experimental results demonstrate that while standard end-to-end MTL training can minimize grading error (MAE=0.046) through our designed "Feature Injection" mechanism, it compromises the integrity of segmentation boundaries. In contrast, our decoupled strategy successfully provides robust and high-precision grading predictions while preserving SOTA-level segmentation accuracy (Dice=0.729). Furthermore, we introduce a "Range Loss" to effectively utilize large-scale discrete grading data for semi-supervised learning. This study ultimately presents a dual-module clinical auxiliary solution that combines high accuracy with visual explainability.

Conclusion: InfiniBench能够生成用于代表性空间推理任务的基准测试，包括测量、视角转换和时空跟踪，展示了其在评估VLM空间推理能力方面的实用性。

Abstract: Modern vision-language models (VLMs) are expected to have abilities of spatial reasoning with diverse scene complexities, but evaluating such abilities is difficult due to the lack of benchmarks that are not only diverse and scalable but also fully customizable. Existing benchmarks offer limited customizability over the scene complexity and are incapable of isolating and analyzing specific VLM failure modes under distinct spatial conditions. To address this gap, instead of individually presenting benchmarks for different scene complexities, in this paper we present InfiniBench, a fully automated, customizable and user-friendly benchmark generator that can synthesize a theoretically infinite variety of 3D scenes with parameterized control on scene complexity. InfiniBench uniquely translates scene descriptions in natural language into photo-realistic videos with complex and physically plausible 3D layouts. This is achieved through three key innovations: 1) a LLM-based agentic framework that iteratively refines procedural scene constraints from scene descriptions; 2) a flexible cluster-based layout optimizer that generates dense and cluttered scenes previously intractable for procedural methods; and 3) a task-aware camera trajectory optimization method that renders scenes into videos with full object coverage as VLM input. Experiments demonstrate that InfiniBench outperforms state-of-the-art procedural and LLM-based 3D generation methods in prompt fidelity and physical plausibility, especially in high-complexity scenarios. We further showcased the usefulness of InfiniBench, by generating benchmarks for representative spatial reasoning tasks including measurement, perspective-taking and spatiotemporal tracking.

Abstract: The success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) at many clinics relies on the accurate morphological assessment of day 5 blastocysts, a process that is often subjective and inconsistent. While artificial intelligence can help standardize this evaluation, models require large, diverse, and balanced datasets, which are often unavailable due to data scarcity, natural class imbalance, and privacy constraints. Existing generative embryo models can mitigate these issues but face several limitations, such as poor image quality, small training datasets, non-robust evaluation, and lack of clinically relevant image generation for effective data augmentation. Here, we present the Diffusion Based Imaging Model for Artificial Blastocysts (DIA) framework, a set of latent diffusion models trained to generate high-fidelity, novel day 5 blastocyst images. Our models provide granular control by conditioning on Gardner-based morphological categories and z-axis focal depth. We rigorously evaluated the models using FID, a memorization metric, an embryologist Turing test, and three downstream classification tasks. Our results show that DIA models generate realistic images that embryologists could not reliably distinguish from real images. Most importantly, we demonstrated clear clinical value. Augmenting an imbalanced dataset with synthetic images significantly improved classification accuracy (p < 0.05). Also, adding synthetic images to an already large, balanced dataset yielded statistically significant performance gains, and synthetic data could replace up to 40% of real data in some cases without a statistically significant loss in accuracy. DIA provides a robust solution for mitigating data scarcity and class imbalance in embryo datasets. By generating novel, high-fidelity, and controllable synthetic images, our models can improve the performance, fairness, and standardization of AI embryo assessment tools.

Conclusion: UNIFIER方法能够有效解决MLLMs在视觉理解中的灾难性遗忘问题，支持模型在动态场景变化下的持续学习。

Abstract: Continual learning in visual understanding aims to deal with catastrophic forgetting in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). MLLMs deployed on devices have to continuously adapt to dynamic scenarios in downstream tasks, such as variations in background and perspective, to effectively perform complex visual tasks. To this end, we construct a multimodal visual understanding dataset (MSVQA) encompassing four different scenarios and perspectives including high altitude, underwater, low altitude and indoor, to investigate the catastrophic forgetting in MLLMs under the dynamics of scenario shifts in real-world data streams. Furthermore, we propose mUltimodal coNtInual learning with MLLMs From multi-scenarIo pERspectives (UNIFIER) to address visual discrepancies while learning different scenarios. Specifically, it decouples the visual information from different scenarios into distinct branches within each vision block and projects them into the same feature space. A consistency constraint is imposed on the features of each branch to maintain the stability of visual representations across scenarios. Extensive experiments on the MSVQA dataset demonstrate that UNIFIER effectively alleviates forgetting of cross-scenario tasks and achieves knowledge accumulation within the same scenario.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种两阶段自监督学习方法，使用Vision Transformer在大规模未标记脑转移瘤MRI数据上进行预训练，然后微调用于区分放射坏死和肿瘤进展，性能显著优于传统监督学习和放射组学方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移瘤立体定向放疗后区分放射坏死和肿瘤进展是临床关键挑战，传统监督学习受限于活检确认的训练数据稀缺，而自监督学习可以利用大规模未标记数据克服这一限制。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习策略：首先在10,167个未标记多源T1CE MRI子体积上通过自监督学习预训练Vision Transformer，然后在公开MOLAB数据集上使用双通道输入（T1CE MRI和分割掩码）进行微调。

Result: 自监督模型在同中心测试集上AUC达0.916，在第二中心测试集上AUC达0.764，显著优于全监督ViT和放射组学方法。多模态集成进一步提升了性能（AUC 0.947/0.821）。

Conclusion: 大规模预训练显著提升AI模型性能，两阶段多模态深度学习策略仅使用常规T1CE MRI和标准临床数据即可高精度区分放射坏死和肿瘤进展，提供了可解释且临床可及的解决方案。

Abstract: Background: Differentiating radiation necrosis (RN) from tumor progression after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) remains a critical challenge in brain metastases. While histopathology represents the gold standard, its invasiveness limits feasibility. Conventional supervised deep learning approaches are constrained by scarce biopsy-confirmed training data. Self-supervised learning (SSL) overcomes this by leveraging the growing availability of large-scale unlabeled brain metastases imaging datasets. Methods: In a two-phase deep learning strategy inspired by the foundation model paradigm, a Vision Transformer (ViT) was pre-trained via SSL on 10,167 unlabeled multi-source T1CE MRI sub-volumes. The pre-trained ViT was then fine-tuned for RN classification using a two-channel input (T1CE MRI and segmentation masks) on the public MOLAB dataset (n=109) using 20% of datasets as same-center held-out test set. External validation was performed on a second-center test cohort (n=28). Results: The self-supervised model achieved an AUC of 0.916 on the same-center test set and 0.764 on the second center test set, surpassing the fully supervised ViT (AUC 0.624/0.496; p=0.001/0.008) and radiomics (AUC 0.807/0.691; p=0.005/0.014). Multimodal integration further improved performance (AUC 0.947/0.821; p=0.073/0.001). Attention map visualizations enabled interpretability showing the model focused on clinically relevant lesion subregions. Conclusion: Large-scale pre-training on increasingly available unlabeled brain metastases datasets substantially improves AI model performance. A two-phase multimodal deep learning strategy achieved high accuracy in differentiating radiation necrosis from tumor progression using only routine T1CE MRI and standard clinical data, providing an interpretable, clinically accessible solution that warrants further validation.

*Wenhao Guo,Golrokh Mirzaei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究首次对胶质母细胞瘤随访MRI的深度学习模型进行了阶段特异性基准测试，发现在不同随访时间点模型性能存在差异，Mamba+CNN混合模型在准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区分胶质母细胞瘤的真实进展与治疗相关的假性进展具有挑战性，特别是在早期随访阶段，需要建立阶段感知的深度学习模型基准。

Method: 使用Burdenko GBM Progression队列（n=180），在统一的质量控制驱动流程下训练11个代表性深度学习家族（CNN、LSTM、混合模型、Transformer和选择性状态空间模型），采用患者级交叉验证独立分析不同放疗后扫描时间点。

Result: 两个阶段的准确率相当（约0.70-0.74），但在第二次随访时区分能力改善，多个模型的F1和AUC提高；Mamba+CNN混合模型在准确性和效率方面表现最佳；Transformer变体提供竞争性AUC但计算成本显著更高；性能对批量大小敏感。

Conclusion: 绝对区分能力总体仍然有限，反映了TP与PsP区分的内在困难性和数据集大小不平衡；结果为阶段感知基准奠定了基础，并激励未来工作整合纵向建模、多序列MRI和更大的多中心队列。

Abstract: Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.

TL;DR: SConvTransform是一个MLIR转换方言扩展，通过声明式转换流水线将2D卷积优化为分块和打包的通用操作，在ARM SME和Intel AVX512上分别达到峰值性能的60%和67%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化2D卷积在MLIR中的实现，通过静态形状分析和结构化分块打包策略提高卷积运算性能。

Method: 使用SConvOp操作将Linalg卷积降级为分块打包的通用操作，基于卷积切片分析确定分块大小和数据布局策略，通过参数化仿射方程推导所有打包和分块操作。

Result: 在标准卷积配置下，生成的代码在ARM SME上达到峰值性能的60%，在Intel AVX512上达到67%。

Conclusion: 将静态形状分析与结构化分块打包策略结合在MLIR转换方言中是有效的，SConvTransform的模块化设计便于与未来扩展集成。

Abstract: This paper proposes SConvTransform, a Transform dialect extension that provides operations for optimizing 2D convolutions in MLIR. Its main operation, SConvOp, lowers Linalg convolutions into tiled and packed generic operations through a fully declarative transformation pipeline. The process is guided by a Convolution Slicing Analysis that determines tile sizes and data layout strategies based on input and filter shapes, as well as target architecture parameters. SConvOp handles edge cases by splitting irregular regions and adjusting affine maps where needed. All packing and tiling operations are derived from a parametric set of affine equations, enabling reusable and analyzable transformations. Although functional correctness was the primary goal of this work, the experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of SConvTransform, achieving good enough performance across different target architectures. Future work will focus on optimizing performance and porting to other target devices. When applied to standard convolution configurations, the generated code achieves up to 60% of peak performance on ARM SME and 67% on Intel AVX512. These results validate the benefit of combining static shape analysis with structured tiling and packing strategies within the MLIR Transform dialect. Furthermore, the modular design of SConvTransform facilitates integration with future extensions, enabling continued optimization of convolution workloads through MLIR's extensible compilation infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间长，限制患者吞吐量且易产生运动伪影。传统并行MRI技术需要欠采样数据和预计算线圈图，而深度学习可端到端解决此问题

Method: 两模块架构：线圈灵敏度图估计模块和基于U-Net的MRI重建模块，直接从欠采样k空间测量重建图像

Result: 在10名受试者的多线圈脑部MRI数据上评估，相比传统SENSE产生视觉更平滑的重建，视觉质量相当但PSNR/SSIM指标较低

Conclusion: 方法可行但面临不同加速因子间空间错位等挑战，提出了改进重建质量的未来方向

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquisitions require extensive scan times, limiting patient throughput and increasing susceptibility to motion artifacts. Accelerated parallel MRI techniques reduce acquisition time by undersampling k-space data, but require robust reconstruction methods to recover high-quality images. Traditional approaches like SENSE require both undersampled k-space data and pre-computed coil sensitivity maps. We propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that jointly estimates coil sensitivity maps and reconstructs images from only undersampled k-space measurements at 4x acceleration. Our two-module architecture consists of a Coil Sensitivity Map (CSM) estimation module and a U-Net-based MRI reconstruction module. We evaluate our method on multi-coil brain MRI data from 10 subjects with 8 echoes each, using 2x SENSE reconstructions as ground truth. Our approach produces visually smoother reconstructions compared to conventional SENSE output, achieving comparable visual quality despite lower PSNR/SSIM metrics. We identify key challenges including spatial misalignment between different acceleration factors and propose future directions for improved reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EgoVITA是一个强化学习框架，通过交替的自我中心规划和外部中心验证阶段，使多模态大语言模型能够从第一人称视角进行推理，在自我中心推理任务上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型从第一人称视角推理意图和行为的根本挑战，因为自我中心视频具有部分可观测性、有限视野和自参考运动等特性。

Method: 基于组相对策略优化(GRPO)的强化学习框架，包含两个交替阶段：自我中心规划阶段（从第一人称视角预测未来行动步骤）和外部中心验证阶段（从第三人称视角检查计划的视觉和逻辑一致性）。

Result: 在自我中心推理任务上取得显著提升，相比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B，在EgoBlind上提升+7.7，在EgoOrient上提升+4.4，同时在外部中心视频任务上保持强泛化能力。

Conclusion: EgoVITA通过结构化规划和验证机制，使模型能够做出对即将到来的视觉观察具有因果预测性的计划，从而实现更连贯和视觉基础化的推理。

Abstract: Reasoning about intentions and actions from a first-person (egocentric) perspective remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Unlike third-person (exocentric) videos that capture scenes from an outside observer, egocentric videos reflect the actor's continuously changing viewpoint, introducing partial observability, limited field of view, and self-referenced motion. We introduce $\textbf{EgoVITA}$, a reinforcement learning framework that enables MLLMs to reason through structured planning and verification. Built on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), EgoVITA alternates between two stages: (1) an $\textbf{egocentric planning phase}$, where the model reasons from a first-person viewpoint to predict a step-by-step plan of future actions, and (2) an $\textbf{exocentric verification phase}$, where it switches to a third-person perspective to check the visual and logical consistency of that plan. Through GRPO, the model learns to make plans that are causally predictive of upcoming visual observations, leading to more coherent and visually grounded reasoning. EgoVITA achieves significant gains on egocentric reasoning tasks, outperforming the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by $\mathbf{+7.7}$ on EgoBlind and $\mathbf{+4.4}$ on EgoOrient, while maintaining strong generalization on exocentric video tasks.

Motivation: 探索学习通用的运动先验知识，使其能够迁移到不同且未见过的LiDAR传感器上，打破传统认知中多数据集训练会降低性能的局限。

Method: 提出UniFlow系列前馈模型，统一训练多个大规模LiDAR场景流数据集，这些数据集具有不同的传感器布局和点云密度。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上分别比先前工作提升5.1%和35.2%，在未见过的TruckScenes数据集上比专门模型提升30.1%。

Conclusion: 运动估计等低级任务对传感器配置的敏感性较低，跨数据集训练能够显著提升LiDAR场景流估计的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: LiDAR scene flow is the task of estimating per-point 3D motion between consecutive point clouds. Recent methods achieve centimeter-level accuracy on popular autonomous vehicle (AV) datasets, but are typically only trained and evaluated on a single sensor. In this paper, we aim to learn general motion priors that transfer to diverse and unseen LiDAR sensors. However, prior work in LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection demonstrate that naively training on multiple datasets yields worse performance than single dataset models. Interestingly, we find that this conventional wisdom does not hold for motion estimation, and that state-of-the-art scene flow methods greatly benefit from cross-dataset training. We posit that low-level tasks such as motion estimation may be less sensitive to sensor configuration; indeed, our analysis shows that models trained on fast-moving objects (e.g., from highway datasets) perform well on fast-moving objects, even across different datasets. Informed by our analysis, we propose UniFlow, a family of feedforward models that unifies and trains on multiple large-scale LiDAR scene flow datasets with diverse sensor placements and point cloud densities. Our frustratingly simple solution establishes a new state-of-the-art on Waymo and nuScenes, improving over prior work by 5.1% and 35.2% respectively. Moreover, UniFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on unseen datasets like TruckScenes, outperforming prior TruckScenes-specific models by 30.1%.

Motivation: 前沿AI模型缺乏私有临床数据访问权限，神经影像数据因包含可识别面部特征而在公共领域代表性不足，限制了模型在临床医学中的表现。

Method: 采用可扩展的体积联合嵌入预测架构，在524万临床MRI和CT扫描上进行训练，通过轻量级视觉指令调优与开源语言模型配对。

Result: NeuroVFM在放射学诊断和报告生成等多个临床任务上达到最先进性能，表现出新兴的神经解剖学理解和可解释的视觉定位能力，生成的放射学报告在准确性、临床分诊和专家偏好方面超越前沿模型。

Conclusion: 医疗系统学习是构建通用医疗AI的可行范式，NeuroVFM为临床基础模型提供了可扩展框架，通过临床基础的视觉理解减少了幻觉发现和关键错误，提供更安全的临床决策支持。

Abstract: Frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, such as OpenAI's GPT-5 and Meta's DINOv3, have advanced rapidly through training on internet-scale public data, yet such systems lack access to private clinical data. Neuroimaging, in particular, is underrepresented in the public domain due to identifiable facial features within MRI and CT scans, fundamentally restricting model performance in clinical medicine. Here, we show that frontier models underperform on neuroimaging tasks and that learning directly from uncurated data generated during routine clinical care at health systems, a paradigm we call health system learning, yields high-performance, generalist neuroimaging models. We introduce NeuroVFM, a visual foundation model trained on 5.24 million clinical MRI and CT volumes using a scalable volumetric joint-embedding predictive architecture. NeuroVFM learns comprehensive representations of brain anatomy and pathology, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple clinical tasks, including radiologic diagnosis and report generation. The model exhibits emergent neuroanatomic understanding and interpretable visual grounding of diagnostic findings. When paired with open-source language models through lightweight visual instruction tuning, NeuroVFM generates radiology reports that surpass frontier models in accuracy, clinical triage, and expert preference. Through clinically grounded visual understanding, NeuroVFM reduces hallucinated findings and critical errors, offering safer clinical decision support. These results establish health system learning as a paradigm for building generalist medical AI and provide a scalable framework for clinical foundation models.

Motivation: 针对连续视频流预测任务，现有模型无法有效利用不断出现的新训练样本进行自适应改进，需要一种高效的方法来提升预测性能。

Method: 在推理阶段优化扩散噪声，保持模型参数冻结，让模型自适应确定合适的采样噪声，实现连续视频流的自适应预测。

Result: 在Ego4D、OpenDV-YouTube、UCF-101和SkyTimelapse数据集上的实验表明，SAVi-DNO在FVD、SSIM和PSNR指标上均有提升。

Conclusion: SAVi-DNO通过扩散噪声优化实现了对连续视频流的有效自适应预测，提供了一种参数高效的持续学习方法。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate diffusion-based video prediction models, which forecast future video frames, for continuous video streams. In this context, the models observe continuously new training samples, and we aim to leverage this to improve their predictions. We thus propose an approach that continuously adapts a pre-trained diffusion model to a video stream. Since fine-tuning the parameters of a large diffusion model is too expensive, we refine the diffusion noise during inference while keeping the model parameters frozen, allowing the model to adaptively determine suitable sampling noise. We term the approach Sequence Adaptive Video Prediction with Diffusion Noise Optimization (SAVi-DNO). To validate our approach, we introduce a new evaluation setting on the Ego4D dataset, focusing on simultaneous adaptation and evaluation on long continuous videos. Empirical results demonstrate improved performance based on FVD, SSIM, and PSNR metrics on long videos of Ego4D and OpenDV-YouTube, as well as videos of UCF-101 and SkyTimelapse, showcasing SAVi-DNO's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言模型主要处理分类问答或定性描述任务，但临床决策往往依赖于定量评估（如肿瘤大小测量、关节角度测量），这种定量推理能力在现有模型中尚未得到充分探索和支持。

Method: 构建了MedVision大规模数据集，涵盖22个公共数据集，包含3080万图像-标注对，专注于三个代表性定量任务：解剖结构和异常检测、肿瘤/病变尺寸估计、角度/距离测量。通过监督微调提升模型性能。

Result: 现成的视觉语言模型在这些定量任务上表现不佳，但使用MedVision进行监督微调后，在检测、尺寸估计和测量任务上的性能显著提升，错误率降低，精度提高。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发具有强大定量推理能力的医学成像视觉语言模型奠定了基础，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Current vision-language models (VLMs) in medicine are primarily designed for categorical question answering (e.g., "Is this normal or abnormal?") or qualitative descriptive tasks. However, clinical decision-making often relies on quantitative assessments, such as measuring the size of a tumor or the angle of a joint, from which physicians draw their own diagnostic conclusions. This quantitative reasoning capability remains underexplored and poorly supported in existing VLMs. In this work, we introduce MedVision, a large-scale dataset and benchmark specifically designed to evaluate and improve VLMs on quantitative medical image analysis. MedVision spans 22 public datasets covering diverse anatomies and modalities, with 30.8 million image-annotation pairs. We focus on three representative quantitative tasks: (1) detection of anatomical structures and abnormalities, (2) tumor/lesion (T/L) size estimation, and (3) angle/distance (A/D) measurement. Our benchmarks show that current off-the-shelf VLMs perform poorly on these tasks. However, with supervised fine-tuning on MedVision, we significantly enhance their performance across detection, T/L estimation, and A/D measurement, demonstrating reduced error rates and improved precision. This work provides a foundation for developing VLMs with robust quantitative reasoning capabilities in medical imaging. Code and data are available at https://medvision-vlm.github.io.

Motivation: 解决统一多模态模型中离散语义推理与高保真视觉合成之间的鸿沟，实现理解和生成在单一框架内的有效集成。

Method: 采用串行设计：AR路径进行全局语义建模，单流DiT解码器处理图像合成；通过AR-Diffusion特征对齐模块稳定对齐表示；使用联合训练目标进行端到端训练。

Conclusion: 精心耦合的AR-Diffusion架构可以在单一参数和数据高效的模型中提供高保真生成和编辑，同时保持强大的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to integrate understanding and generation within a single framework, yet bridging the gap between discrete semantic reasoning and high-fidelity visual synthesis remains challenging. We present MammothModa2 (Mammoth2), a unified autoregressive-diffusion (AR-Diffusion) framework designed to effectively couple autoregressive semantic planning with diffusion-based generation. Mammoth2 adopts a serial design: an AR path equipped with generation experts performs global semantic modeling over discrete tokens, while a single-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder handles high-fidelity image synthesis. A carefully designed AR-Diffusion feature alignment module combines multi-layer feature aggregation, unified condition encoding, and in-context conditioning to stably align AR's representations with the diffusion decoder's continuous latents. Mammoth2 is trained end-to-end with joint Next-Token Prediction and Flow Matching objectives, followed by supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning over both generation and editing. With roughly 60M supervised generation samples and no reliance on pre-trained generators, Mammoth2 delivers strong text-to-image and instruction-based editing performance on public benchmarks, achieving 0.87 on GenEval, 87.2 on DPGBench, and 4.06 on ImgEdit, while remaining competitive with understanding-only backbones (e.g., Qwen3-VL-8B) on multimodal understanding tasks. These results suggest that a carefully coupled AR-Diffusion architecture can provide high-fidelity generation and editing while maintaining strong multimodal comprehension within a single, parameter- and data-efficient model.

Abstract: Existing satellite video tracking methods often struggle with generalization, requiring scenario-specific training to achieve satisfactory performance, and are prone to track loss in the presence of occlusion. To address these challenges, we propose SatSAM2, a zero-shot satellite video tracker built on SAM2, designed to adapt foundation models to the remote sensing domain. SatSAM2 introduces two core modules: a Kalman Filter-based Constrained Motion Module (KFCMM) to exploit temporal motion cues and suppress drift, and a Motion-Constrained State Machine (MCSM) to regulate tracking states based on motion dynamics and reliability. To support large-scale evaluation, we propose MatrixCity Video Object Tracking (MVOT), a synthetic benchmark containing 1,500+ sequences and 157K annotated frames with diverse viewpoints, illumination, and occlusion conditions. Extensive experiments on two satellite tracking benchmarks and MVOT show that SatSAM2 outperforms both traditional and foundation model-based trackers, including SAM2 and its variants. Notably, on the OOTB dataset, SatSAM2 achieves a 5.84% AUC improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Our code and dataset will be publicly released to encourage further research.

TL;DR: ObjectAlign是一个解决视频编辑中对象不一致性问题的框架，通过结合感知指标和符号推理来检测、验证和修正对象级及时序不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频编辑和合成经常引入对象不一致问题，如帧闪烁和身份漂移，这会降低感知质量。

Method: 提出可学习的指标阈值（CLIP语义相似度、LPIPS感知距离、直方图相关性、SAM对象掩码IoU）；引入神经符号验证器，结合SMT检查和时序保真度检查；基于神经网络的插值方法进行自适应帧修复。

Result: 在DAVIS和Pexels视频数据集上，相比最先进基线方法，CLIP分数提升1.4分，扭曲误差改善6.1分。

Conclusion: ObjectAlign框架能有效解决视频编辑中的对象不一致性问题，确保低层稳定性和高层时序正确性。

Abstract: Video editing and synthesis often introduce object inconsistencies, such as frame flicker and identity drift that degrade perceptual quality. To address these issues, we introduce ObjectAlign, a novel framework that seamlessly blends perceptual metrics with symbolic reasoning to detect, verify, and correct object-level and temporal inconsistencies in edited video sequences. The novel contributions of ObjectAlign are as follows: First, we propose learnable thresholds for metrics characterizing object consistency (i.e. CLIP-based semantic similarity, LPIPS perceptual distance, histogram correlation, and SAM-derived object-mask IoU). Second, we introduce a neuro-symbolic verifier that combines two components: (a) a formal, SMT-based check that operates on masked object embeddings to provably guarantee that object identity does not drift, and (b) a temporal fidelity check that uses a probabilistic model checker to verify the video's formal representation against a temporal logic specification. A frame transition is subsequently deemed "consistent" based on a single logical assertion that requires satisfying both the learned metric thresholds and this unified neuro-symbolic constraint, ensuring both low-level stability and high-level temporal correctness. Finally, for each contiguous block of flagged frames, we propose a neural network based interpolation for adaptive frame repair, dynamically choosing the interpolation depth based on the number of frames to be corrected. This enables reconstruction of the corrupted frames from the last valid and next valid keyframes. Our results show up to 1.4 point improvement in CLIP Score and up to 6.1 point improvement in warp error compared to SOTA baselines on the DAVIS and Pexels video datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出MC-LRD框架解决少样本视频域自适应问题，通过模态协作低秩分解器分离模态独特和模态共享特征，提升跨域对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频多模态特性在少样本域自适应中面临挑战，需要同时考虑域对齐和模态协作。现有方法忽略了不同模态特征组件具有不同域偏移的问题，限制了跨域泛化性能。

Method: 提出模态协作低秩分解器(MC-LRD)，包含多模态分解路由器和共享参数分解器，通过正交解相关约束和跨域激活一致性损失，选择性生成模态独特和模态共享特征。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试上的实验结果表明，该方法相比现有方法取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: MC-LRD框架有效解决了少样本视频域自适应中的模态协作和域对齐问题，通过特征分解策略提升了跨域泛化性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the challenging task of Few-Shot Video Domain Adaptation (FSVDA). The multimodal nature of videos introduces unique challenges, necessitating the simultaneous consideration of both domain alignment and modality collaboration in a few-shot scenario, which is ignored in previous literature. We observe that, under the influence of domain shift, the generalization performance on the target domain of each individual modality, as well as that of fused multimodal features, is constrained. Because each modality is comprised of coupled features with multiple components that exhibit different domain shifts. This variability increases the complexity of domain adaptation, thereby reducing the effectiveness of multimodal feature integration. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework of Modality-Collaborative LowRank Decomposers (MC-LRD) to decompose modality-unique and modality-shared features with different domain shift levels from each modality that are more friendly for domain alignment. The MC-LRD comprises multiple decomposers for each modality and Multimodal Decomposition Routers (MDR). Each decomposer has progressively shared parameters across different modalities. The MDR is leveraged to selectively activate the decomposers to produce modality-unique and modality-shared features. To ensure efficient decomposition, we apply orthogonal decorrelation constraints separately to decomposers and subrouters, enhancing their diversity. Furthermore, we propose a cross-domain activation consistency loss to guarantee that target and source samples of the same category exhibit consistent activation preferences of the decomposers, thereby facilitating domain alignment. Extensive experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing methods.

### [134] [Vision Token Masking Alone Cannot Prevent PHI Leakage in Medical Document OCR: A Systematic Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18272)
*Richard J. Young*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了视觉令牌掩码作为医疗文档OCR隐私保护机制的效果，发现所有掩码策略对PHI的减少率都收敛于42.9%，能有效抑制长文本标识符但无法阻止短结构化标识符泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在医疗环境中部署OCR时存在受保护健康信息暴露风险，需要评估视觉令牌掩码作为隐私保护机制的有效性。

Method: 使用DeepSeek-OCR，引入7种针对不同架构层的掩码策略，在100份合成医疗账单上评估HIPAA定义的PHI类别减少效果，并进行掩码扩展半径的消融研究。

Result: 所有掩码策略都达到42.9%的PHI减少率，能100%抑制长文本标识符但0%阻止短结构化标识符。模拟混合架构结合NLP后处理可实现88.6%的总PHI减少。

Conclusion: 纯视觉隐私干预存在局限性，需要区分适合视觉级与语言级编辑的PHI类型，未来研究应转向解码器级微调和混合防御架构以实现HIPAA合规的医疗文档处理。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed for optical character recognition (OCR) in healthcare settings, raising critical concerns about protected health information (PHI) exposure during document processing. This work presents the first systematic evaluation of inference-time vision token masking as a privacy-preserving mechanism for medical document OCR using DeepSeek-OCR. We introduce seven masking strategies (V3-V9) targeting different architectural layers (SAM encoder blocks, compression layers, dual vision encoders, projector fusion) and evaluate PHI reduction across HIPAA-defined categories using 100 synthetic medical billing statements (drawn from a corpus of 38,517 annotated documents) with perfect ground-truth annotations. All masking strategies converge to 42.9% PHI reduction, successfully suppressing long-form spatially-distributed identifiers (patient names, dates of birth, physical addresses at 100% effectiveness) while failing to prevent short structured identifiers (medical record numbers, social security numbers, email addresses, account numbers at 0% effectiveness). Ablation studies varying mask expansion radius (r=1,2,3) demonstrate that increased spatial coverage does not improve reduction beyond this ceiling, indicating that language model contextual inference - not insufficient visual masking - drives structured identifier leakage. A simulated hybrid architecture combining vision masking with NLP post-processing achieves 88.6% total PHI reduction (assuming 80% NLP accuracy on remaining identifiers). This negative result establishes boundaries for vision-only privacy interventions in VLMs, provides guidance distinguishing PHI types amenable to vision-level versus language-level redaction, and redirects future research toward decoder-level fine-tuning and hybrid defense-in-depth architectures for HIPAA-compliant medical document processing.

Conclusion: Yo'City框架通过利用大模型的推理和组合能力，成功实现了用户定制化和无限扩展的3D城市生成，为虚拟现实和数字孪生应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic 3D city generation is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including virtual reality and digital twins. However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法在编辑保真度和运动保真度之间存在权衡，因为它们依赖的运动表示要么过度拟合布局，要么只是隐式定义。需要一种能准确保持运动同时编辑主体的解决方案。

Method: 提出锚点令牌运动表示，利用视频扩散模型的丰富先验捕捉最本质的运动模式。通过少量信息点轨迹紧凑编码视频动态，并可灵活重新定位以与新主体对齐。

Conclusion: 锚点令牌作为一种新颖的运动表示方法，能够泛化到多样化场景，有效解决了视频编辑中运动保持的核心挑战。

Abstract: Accurately preserving motion while editing a subject remains a core challenge in video editing tasks. Existing methods often face a trade-off between edit and motion fidelity, as they rely on motion representations that are either overfitted to the layout or only implicitly defined. To overcome this limitation, we revisit point-based motion representation. However, identifying meaningful points remains challenging without human input, especially across diverse video scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel motion representation, anchor tokens, that capture the most essential motion patterns by leveraging the rich prior of a video diffusion model. Anchor tokens encode video dynamics compactly through a small number of informative point trajectories and can be flexibly relocated to align with new subjects. This allows our method, Point-to-Point, to generalize across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that anchor tokens lead to more controllable and semantically aligned video edits, achieving superior performance in terms of edit and motion fidelity.

Abstract: In this work, we define Foresight Intelligence as the capability to anticipate and interpret future events-an ability essential for applications such as autonomous driving, yet largely overlooked by existing research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FSU-QA, a new Visual Question-Answering (VQA) dataset specifically designed to elicit and evaluate Foresight Intelligence. Using FSU-QA, we conduct the first comprehensive study of state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) under foresight-oriented tasks, revealing that current models still struggle to reason about future situations. Beyond serving as a benchmark, FSU-QA also enables the assessment of world models by measuring the semantic coherence of their generated predictions, quantified through performance gains when VLMs are augmented with such outputs. Our experiments further demonstrate that FSU-QA can effectively enhance foresight reasoning: even small VLMs fine-tuned on FSU-QA surpass much larger, advanced models by a substantial margin. Together, these findings position FSU-QA as a principled foundation for developing next-generation models capable of truly anticipating and understanding future events.

Conclusion: ProxT2I为人类文本到图像生成提供了一个轻量级但高性能的解决方案，在保持性能的同时降低了计算成本和模型大小。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a dominant paradigm for generative modeling across a wide range of domains, including prompt-conditional generation. The vast majority of samplers, however, rely on forward discretization of the reverse diffusion process and use score functions that are learned from data. Such forward and explicit discretizations can be slow and unstable, requiring a large number of sampling steps to produce good-quality samples. In this work we develop a text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model based on backward discretizations, dubbed ProxT2I, relying on learned and conditional proximal operators instead of score functions. We further leverage recent advances in reinforcement learning and policy optimization to optimize our samplers for task-specific rewards. Additionally, we develop a new large-scale and open-source dataset comprising 15 million high-quality human images with fine-grained captions, called LAION-Face-T2I-15M, for training and evaluation. Our approach consistently enhances sampling efficiency and human-preference alignment compared to score-based baselines, and achieves results on par with existing state-of-the-art and open-source text-to-image models while requiring lower compute and smaller model size, offering a lightweight yet performant solution for human text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Current roadside perception systems mainly focus on instance-level perception, which fall short in enabling interaction via natural language and reasoning about traffic behaviors in context. To bridge this gap, we introduce RoadSceneVQA, a large-scale and richly annotated visual question answering (VQA) dataset specifically tailored for roadside scenarios. The dataset comprises 34,736 diverse QA pairs collected under varying weather, illumination, and traffic conditions, targeting not only object attributes but also the intent, legality, and interaction patterns of traffic participants. RoadSceneVQA challenges models to perform both explicit recognition and implicit commonsense reasoning, grounded in real-world traffic rules and contextual dependencies. To fully exploit the reasoning potential of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), we further propose CogniAnchor Fusion (CAF), a vision-language fusion module inspired by human-like scene anchoring mechanisms. Moreover, we propose the Assisted Decoupled Chain-of-Thought (AD-CoT) to enhance the reasoned thinking via CoT prompting and multi-task learning. Based on the above, we propose the baseline model RoadMind. Experiments on RoadSceneVQA and CODA-LM benchmark show that the pipeline consistently improves both reasoning accuracy and computational efficiency, allowing the MLLM to achieve state-of-the-art performance in structural traffic perception and reasoning tasks.

Abstract: While video-generation-based embodied world models have gained increasing attention, their reliance on large-scale embodied interaction data remains a key bottleneck. The scarcity, difficulty of collection, and high dimensionality of embodied data fundamentally limit the alignment granularity between language and actions and exacerbate the challenge of long-horizon video generation--hindering generative models from achieving a \textit{"GPT moment"} in the embodied domain. There is a naive observation: \textit{the diversity of embodied data far exceeds the relatively small space of possible primitive motions}. Based on this insight, we propose \textbf{Primitive Embodied World Models} (PEWM), which restricts video generation to fixed shorter horizons, our approach \textit{1) enables} fine-grained alignment between linguistic concepts and visual representations of robotic actions, \textit{2) reduces} learning complexity, \textit{3) improves} data efficiency in embodied data collection, and \textit{4) decreases} inference latency. By equipping with a modular Vision-Language Model (VLM) planner and a Start-Goal heatmap Guidance mechanism (SGG), PEWM further enables flexible closed-loop control and supports compositional generalization of primitive-level policies over extended, complex tasks. Our framework leverages the spatiotemporal vision priors in video models and the semantic awareness of VLMs to bridge the gap between fine-grained physical interaction and high-level reasoning, paving the way toward scalable, interpretable, and general-purpose embodied intelligence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型拥有丰富的文本知识，但在细粒度图像识别方面表现不佳，难以区分视觉相似的类别。现有的基于精确匹配奖励信号的强化学习方法存在脆弱性，容易导致模型记忆训练类别，缺乏区分性推理能力。

Method: 提出DiVE-k框架：对每个训练图像，从模型的top-k输出创建多项选择题，使用强化学习训练模型选择正确答案。这种方法要求模型在合理选项间进行细粒度区分推理，提供简单可验证的奖励信号。

Result: 在五个标准细粒度数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法。在基础到新颖泛化设置中，DiVE-k在调和平均数指标上分别超过QWEN2.5-VL-7B和ViRFT 10.04%和6.16%。在混合域和少样本场景中也显示出类似优势。

Conclusion: DiVE-k通过利用模型自身top-k预测作为训练信号，有效缓解了记忆问题并提升了泛化能力，在细粒度视觉推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) possess extensive text knowledge but struggles to utilize this knowledge for fine-grained image recognition, often failing to differentiate between visually similar categories. Existing fine-tuning methods using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with exact-match reward signals are often brittle, encourage memorization of training categories, and fail to elicit differential reasoning needed for generalization to unseen classes. To address this, we propose $\textbf{DiVE-k}$, $\textbf{Di}$fferential $\textbf{V}$isual r$\textbf{E}$asoning using top-$\textbf{k}$ generations, framework that leverages model's own top-k predictions as a training signal. For each training image, DiVE-k creates a multiple-choice question from the model's top-k outputs and uses RL to train the model to select the correct answer. This approach requires the model to perform fine-grained differential reasoning among plausible options and provides a simple, verifiable reward signal that mitigates memorization and improves generalization. Experiments on five standard fine-grained datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches. In the standard base-to-novel generalization setting, DiVE-k surpasses the QWEN2.5-VL-7B and ViRFT by 10.04% and 6.16% on the Harmonic Mean metric, respectively. Further experiments show similar gains in mixed-domain and few-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法通常为单视角输入设计，将多视角视为不连接的图像集合，导致特征表示不一致和误报率高。需要解决多视角图像中真实缺陷与视角变化引起的外观变化难以区分的问题。

Conclusion: VSAD通过建模几何一致性实现了对多视角图像的鲁棒异常检测，证明了显式视角对齐在构建物体表面连贯理解中的重要性，为多视角异常检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised visual anomaly detection from multi-view images presents a significant challenge: distinguishing genuine defects from benign appearance variations caused by viewpoint changes. Existing methods, often designed for single-view inputs, treat multiple views as a disconnected set of images, leading to inconsistent feature representations and a high false-positive rate. To address this, we introduce ViewSense-AD (VSAD), a novel framework that learns viewpoint-invariant representations by explicitly modeling geometric consistency across views. At its core is our Multi-View Alignment Module (MVAM), which leverages homography to project and align corresponding feature regions between neighboring views. We integrate MVAM into a View-Align Latent Diffusion Model (VALDM), enabling progressive and multi-stage alignment during the denoising process. This allows the model to build a coherent and holistic understanding of the object's surface from coarse to fine scales. Furthermore, a lightweight Fusion Refiner Module (FRM) enhances the global consistency of the aligned features, suppressing noise and improving discriminative power. Anomaly detection is performed by comparing multi-level features from the diffusion model against a learned memory bank of normal prototypes. Extensive experiments on the challenging RealIAD and MANTA datasets demonstrate that VSAD sets a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods in pixel, view, and sample-level visual anomaly proving its robustness to large viewpoint shifts and complex textures.

Motivation: 虽然基于双UNet架构的扩散模型在虚拟试穿任务中表现出色，但其计算和内存开销巨大。本研究旨在开发更高效的单UNet模型，在保持高性能的同时减少资源消耗。

Method: 通过可视化分析和理论分析提出三个关于上下文特征学习的假设，开发Re-CatVTON单UNet模型，引入改进的分类器自由引导策略，并直接注入真实服装潜在特征以防止预测误差累积。

Result: 与先前模型相比，Re-CatVTON显著提升了FID、KID和LPIPS分数，仅SSIM略有下降，在计算和内存需求上优于高性能双UNet模型Leffa。

Conclusion: Re-CatVTON为单UNet虚拟试穿模型建立了新的效率-性能平衡，证明了在减少计算资源的同时仍能实现高质量合成效果的可能性。

Abstract: Virtual Try-On (VTON) is the task of synthesizing an image of a person wearing a target garment, conditioned on a person image and a garment image. While diffusion-based VTON models featuring a Dual UNet architecture demonstrate superior fidelity compared to single UNet models, they incur substantial computational and memory overhead due to their heavy structure. In this study, through visualization analysis and theoretical analysis, we derived three hypotheses regarding the learning of context features to condition the denoising process. Based on these hypotheses, we developed Re-CatVTON, an efficient single UNet model that achieves high performance. We further enhance the model by introducing a modified classifier-free guidance strategy tailored for VTON's spatial concatenation conditioning, and by directly injecting the ground-truth garment latent derived from the clean garment latent to prevent the accumulation of prediction error. The proposed Re-CatVTON significantly improves performance compared to its predecessor (CatVTON) and requires less computation and memory than the high-performance Dual UNet model, Leffa. Our results demonstrate improved FID, KID, and LPIPS scores, with only a marginal decrease in SSIM, establishing a new efficiency-performance trade-off for single UNet VTON models.

Result: 在两个新基准测试上的综合实验表明，ConceptGuard在风险检测和安全视频生成方面始终优于现有基线方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ConceptGuard为多模态视频生成提供了一个有效的主动安全保障框架，能够成功检测和缓解组合式多模态风险。

Abstract: Recent progress in video generative models has enabled the creation of high-quality videos from multimodal prompts that combine text and images. While these systems offer enhanced controllability, they also introduce new safety risks, as harmful content can emerge from individual modalities or their interaction. Existing safety methods are often text-only, require prior knowledge of the risk category, or operate as post-generation auditors, struggling to proactively mitigate such compositional, multimodal risks. To address this challenge, we present ConceptGuard, a unified safeguard framework for proactively detecting and mitigating unsafe semantics in multimodal video generation. ConceptGuard operates in two stages: First, a contrastive detection module identifies latent safety risks by projecting fused image-text inputs into a structured concept space; Second, a semantic suppression mechanism steers the generative process away from unsafe concepts by intervening in the prompt's multimodal conditioning. To support the development and rigorous evaluation of this framework, we introduce two novel benchmarks: ConceptRisk, a large-scale dataset for training on multimodal risks, and T2VSafetyBench-TI2V, the first benchmark adapted from T2VSafetyBench for the Text-and-Image-to-Video (TI2V) safety setting. Comprehensive experiments on both benchmarks show that ConceptGuard consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in both risk detection and safe video generation.

Abstract: Stereo optical measurement techniques, such as digital image correlation (DIC), are widely used in 3D deformation measurement as non-contact, full-field measurement methods, in which stereo calibration is a crucial step. However, current stereo calibration methods lack intuitive optimal pose guidance, leading to inefficiency and suboptimal accuracy in deformation measurements. The aim of this study is to develop an interactive calibration framework that automatically generates the next optimal pose, enabling high-accuracy stereo calibration for 3D deformation measurement. We propose a pose optimization method that introduces joint optimization of relative and absolute extrinsic parameters, with the minimization of the covariance matrix trace adopted as the loss function to solve for the next optimal pose. Integrated with this method is a user-friendly graphical interface, which guides even non-expert users to capture qualified calibration images. Our proposed method demonstrates superior efficiency (requiring fewer images) and accuracy (demonstrating lower measurement errors) compared to random pose, while maintaining robustness across varying FOVs. In the thermal deformation measurement tests on an S-shaped specimen, the results exhibit high agreement with finite element analysis (FEA) simulations in both deformation magnitude and evolutionary trends. We present a pose guidance method for high-precision stereo calibration in 3D deformation measurement. The simulation experiments, real-world experiments, and thermal deformation measurement applications all demonstrate the significant application potential of our proposed method in the field of 3D deformation measurement.

Abstract: Streamline classification is essential to identify anatomically meaningful white matter tracts from diffusion MRI (dMRI) tractography. However, current streamline classification methods rely primarily on the geometric features of the streamline trajectory, failing to distinguish between functionally distinct fiber tracts with similar pathways. To address this, we introduce a novel dual-stream streamline classification framework that jointly analyzes dMRI and functional MRI (fMRI) data to enhance the functional coherence of tract parcellation. We design a novel network that performs streamline classification using a pretrained backbone model for full streamline trajectories, while augmenting with an auxiliary network that processes fMRI signals from fiber endpoint regions. We demonstrate our method by parcellating the corticospinal tract (CST) into its four somatotopic subdivisions. Experimental results from ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate our approach's superior performance.

Conclusion: SciPostLayoutTree数据集和Layout Tree Decoder模型填补了海报结构分析的研究空白，为构建结构感知界面提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Scientific posters play a vital role in academic communication by presenting ideas through visual summaries. Analyzing reading order and parent-child relations of posters is essential for building structure-aware interfaces that facilitate clear and accurate understanding of research content. Despite their prevalence in academic communication, posters remain underexplored in structural analysis research, which has primarily focused on papers. To address this gap, we constructed SciPostLayoutTree, a dataset of approximately 8,000 posters annotated with reading order and parent-child relations. Compared to an existing structural analysis dataset, SciPostLayoutTree contains more instances of spatially challenging relations, including upward, horizontal, and long-distance relations. As a solution to these challenges, we develop Layout Tree Decoder, which incorporates visual features as well as bounding box features including position and category information. The model also uses beam search to predict relations while capturing sequence-level plausibility. Experimental results demonstrate that our model improves the prediction accuracy for spatially challenging relations and establishes a solid baseline for poster structure analysis. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree. The code is also publicly available at https://github.com/omron-sinicx/scipostlayouttree.

Motivation: 现有的VLM方法依赖额外训练或提示调优，计算开销大且可扩展性有限，特别是在长尾场景中罕见交互严重不足

Method: 构建类特定缓存，在推理过程中积累高置信度和多样化的特征表示，采用频率感知缓存适应机制偏向罕见类别

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上，罕见类别mAP提升达8.57%，完整数据集提升4.39%

Conclusion: ADC模块能有效缓解长尾偏差，同时保持整体性能，无需额外训练或微调

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, empowering machines to comprehend human-object relationships in diverse real-world scenarios. Recent advances in VLMs have significantly improved HOI detection by leveraging rich cross-modal representations. However, most existing VLM-based approaches rely heavily on additional training or prompt tuning, resulting in substantial computational overhead and limited scalability, particularly in long-tailed scenarios where rare interactions are severely underrepresented. In this paper, we propose the Adaptive Diversity Cache (ADC) module, a novel training-free and plug-and-play mechanism designed to mitigate long-tail bias in HOI detection. ADC constructs class-specific caches that accumulate high-confidence and diverse feature representations during inference. The method incorporates frequency-aware cache adaptation that favors rare categories and is designed to enable robust prediction calibration without requiring additional training or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets show that ADC consistently improves existing HOI detectors, achieving up to +8.57\% mAP gain on rare categories and +4.39\% on the full dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating long-tail bias while preserving overall performance.

TL;DR: ConsistCompose是一个统一的多模态框架，通过将布局坐标直接嵌入语言提示中，实现布局可控的多实例图像生成，无需特定任务分支。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要关注视觉接地（语言与图像区域对齐），而其生成对应部分——基于语言嵌入布局的生成（LELG）在布局可控的多实例生成方面研究不足，限制了精确的组合控制能力。

Method: 提出ConsistCompose框架，通过实例坐标绑定提示和坐标感知的无分类器引导，将语言布局线索转换为精确的空间控制；构建了包含340万条多实例生成数据的ConsistCompose3M数据集，提供大规模布局条件生成监督。

Result: 在COCO-Position和MS-Bench上的实验表明，ConsistCompose相比布局控制基线显著提高了空间准确性，同时保持了身份保真度和竞争力的通用多模态理解能力。

Conclusion: ConsistCompose为布局可控的多模态图像生成建立了一个统一的范式，实现了精确的空间控制与生成质量的平衡。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models that couple visual understanding with image generation have advanced rapidly, yet most systems still focus on visual grounding-aligning language with image regions-while their generative counterpart, linguistic-embedded layout-grounded generation (LELG) for layout-controllable multi-instance generation, remains underexplored and limits precise compositional control. We present ConsistCompose, a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts, enabling layout-controlled multi-instance image generation from Interleaved Image-Text within a single generative interface. We further construct ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations (2.6M text-guided and 0.8M image-guided data pairs) that provides large-scale supervision for layout-conditioned generation. Within this framework, LELG is instantiated through instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance, which translate linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without task-specific branches. Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and competitive general multimodal understanding, establishing a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流匹配在视觉生成中取得成功，但采样效率仍是实际应用的关键瓶颈。ReFlow方法虽然与流匹配理论一致，但在实际场景中表现不如一致性蒸馏和分数蒸馏。

Method: 提出FlowSteer方法：1）识别Piecewised ReFlow训练中的分布不匹配问题，提出在线轨迹对齐(OTA)解决；2）在ODE轨迹上应用对抗蒸馏目标，提高学生对教师生成轨迹的遵循度；3）修复FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler中影响少步推理质量的缺陷。

Result: 在SD3上的实验结果表明该方法有效。

Conclusion: FlowSteer解锁了基于ReFlow的蒸馏潜力，通过引导学生沿着教师的真实生成轨迹，提升了采样效率。

Abstract: With the success of flow matching in visual generation, sampling efficiency remains a critical bottleneck for its practical application. Among flow models' accelerating methods, ReFlow has been somehow overlooked although it has theoretical consistency with flow matching. This is primarily due to its suboptimal performance in practical scenarios compared to consistency distillation and score distillation. In this work, we investigate this issue within the ReFlow framework and propose FlowSteer, a method unlocks the potential of ReFlow-based distillation by guiding the student along teacher's authentic generation trajectories. We first identify that Piecewised ReFlow's performance is hampered by a critical distribution mismatch during the training and propose Online Trajectory Alignment(OTA) to resolve it. Then, we introduce a adversarial distillation objective applied directly on the ODE trajectory, improving the student's adherence to the teacher's generation trajectory. Furthermore, we find and fix a previously undiscovered flaw in the widely-used FlowMatchEulerDiscreteScheduler that largely degrades few-step inference quality. Our experiment result on SD3 demonstrates our method's efficacy.

Result: 综合实验表明，所提出的框架持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MM-UAV数据集和提出的多模态跟踪框架为未来多模态无人机跟踪研究提供了基准和基础，将促进该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the proliferation of low altitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), visual multi-object tracking is becoming a critical security technology, demanding significant robustness even in complex environmental conditions. However, tracking UAVs using a single visual modality often fails in challenging scenarios, such as low illumination, cluttered backgrounds, and rapid motion. Although multi-modal multi-object UAV tracking is more resilient, the development of effective solutions has been hindered by the absence of dedicated public datasets. To bridge this gap, we release MM-UAV, the first large-scale benchmark for Multi-Modal UAV Tracking, integrating three key sensing modalities, e.g. RGB, infrared (IR), and event signals. The dataset spans over 30 challenging scenarios, with 1,321 synchronised multi-modal sequences, and more than 2.8 million annotated frames. Accompanying the dataset, we provide a novel multi-modal multi-UAV tracking framework, designed specifically for UAV tracking applications and serving as a baseline for future research. Our framework incorporates two key technical innovations, e.g. an offset-guided adaptive alignment module to resolve spatio mismatches across sensors, and an adaptive dynamic fusion module to balance complementary information conveyed by different modalities. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of conventional appearance modelling in multi-object tracking, we introduce an event-enhanced association mechanism that leverages motion cues from the event modality for more reliable identity maintenance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. To foster further research in multi-modal UAV tracking, both the dataset and source code will be made publicly available at https://xuefeng-zhu5.github.io/MM-UAV/.

Motivation: 现有PFL方法大多忽略了不同客户端间共享特征的潜在价值，特别是在不同器官分割数据场景下，未能充分利用跨器官的长程特征依赖关系。

Method: 提出解耦交叉注意力机制，让每个客户端保留本地查询，同时关注全局共享的键值对；引入扰动边界损失函数，专注于预测掩码边界的不一致性，提升边界定位精度。

Result: 在多种器官的肿瘤分割任务上，FedOAP持续优于现有的最先进联邦学习和个性化分割方法。

Conclusion: FedOAP通过有效利用跨客户端共享特征和改善边界一致性，在个性化联邦学习框架下显著提升了器官无关肿瘤分割的性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) possesses the unique capability of preserving data confidentiality among clients while tackling the data heterogeneity problem of non-independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) data. Its advantages have led to widespread adoption in domains such as medical image segmentation. However, the existing approaches mostly overlook the potential benefits of leveraging shared features across clients, where each client contains segmentation data of different organs. In this work, we introduce a novel personalized federated approach for organ agnostic tumor segmentation (FedOAP), that utilizes cross-attention to model long-range dependencies among the shared features of different clients and a boundary-aware loss to improve segmentation consistency. FedOAP employs a decoupled cross-attention (DCA), which enables each client to retain local queries while attending to globally shared key-value pairs aggregated from all clients, thereby capturing long-range inter-organ feature dependencies. Additionally, we introduce perturbed boundary loss (PBL) which focuses on the inconsistencies of the predicted mask's boundary for each client, forcing the model to localize the margins more precisely. We evaluate FedOAP on diverse tumor segmentation tasks spanning different organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedOAP consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art federated and personalized segmentation methods.

Abstract: Video relighting with background replacement is a challenging task critical for applications in film production and creative media. Existing methods struggle to balance temporal consistency, spatial fidelity, and illumination naturalness. To address these issues, we introduce FlowPortal, a novel training-free flow-based video relighting framework. Our core innovation is a Residual-Corrected Flow mechanism that transforms a standard flow-based model into an editing model, guaranteeing perfect reconstruction when input conditions are identical and enabling faithful relighting when they differ, resulting in high structural consistency. This is further enhanced by a Decoupled Condition Design for precise lighting control and a High-Frequency Transfer mechanism for detail preservation. Additionally, a masking strategy isolates foreground relighting from background pure generation process. Experiments demonstrate that FlowPortal achieves superior performance in temporal coherence, structural preservation, and lighting realism, while maintaining high efficiency.

Conclusion: 成功设计并测试了用于识别360度视频ROI的混合显著性模型

Abstract: The main goal of the project is to design a new model that predicts regions of interest in 360$^{\circ}$ videos. The region of interest (ROI) plays an important role in 360$^{\circ}$ video streaming. For example, ROIs are used to predict view-ports, intelligently cut the videos for live streaming, etc so that less bandwidth is used. Detecting view-ports in advance helps reduce the movement of the head while streaming and watching a video via the head-mounted device. Whereas, intelligent cuts of the videos help improve the efficiency of streaming the video to users and enhance the quality of their viewing experience. This report illustrates the secondary task to identify ROIs, in which, we design, train, and test a hybrid saliency model. In this work, we refer to saliency regions to represent the regions of interest. The method includes the processes as follows: preprocessing the video to obtain frames, developing a hybrid saliency model for predicting the region of interest, and finally post-processing the output predictions of the hybrid saliency model to obtain the output region of interest for each frame. Then, we compare the performance of the proposed method with the subjective annotations of the 360RAT dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) models have enabled significant progress in image and video generation. However, users still struggle to obtain content that aligns with their preferences due to the difficulty of crafting detailed prompts and the lack of mechanisms to retain their preferences. To address these challenges, we construct \textbf{UniPrefer-100K}, a large-scale dataset comprising images, videos, and associated text that describes the styles users tend to prefer. Based on UniPrefer-100K, we propose \textbf{MagicWand}, a universal generation and evaluation agent that enhances prompts based on user preferences, leverages advanced generation models for high-quality content, and applies preference-aligned evaluation and refinement. In addition, we introduce \textbf{UniPreferBench}, the first large-scale benchmark with over 120K annotations for assessing user preference alignment across diverse AIGC tasks. Experiments on UniPreferBench demonstrate that MagicWand consistently generates content and evaluations that are well aligned with user preferences across a wide range of scenarios.

Abstract: How do video understanding models acquire their answers? Although current Vision Language Models (VLMs) reason over complex scenes with diverse objects, action performances, and scene dynamics, understanding and controlling their internal processes remains an open challenge. Motivated by recent advancements in text-to-video (T2V) generative models, this paper introduces a logits-to-video (L2V) task alongside a model-independent approach, TRANSPORTER, to generate videos that capture the underlying rules behind VLMs' predictions. Given the high-visual-fidelity produced by T2V models, TRANSPORTER learns an optimal transport coupling to VLM's high-semantic embedding spaces. In turn, logit scores define embedding directions for conditional video generation. TRANSPORTER generates videos that reflect caption changes over diverse object attributes, action adverbs, and scene context. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations across VLMs demonstrate that L2V can provide a fidelity-rich, novel direction for model interpretability that has not been previously explored.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了动态场景重建中的高频伪影问题，提高了渲染质量并减少了冗余计算。

Abstract: Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based on Gaussian Splatting enable real-time rendering and generate realistic images. However, adjusting the camera's focal length or the distance between Gaussian primitives and the camera to modify rendering resolution often introduces strong artifacts, stemming from the frequency constraints of 4D Gaussians and Gaussian scale mismatch induced by the 2D dilated filter. To address this, we derive a maximum sampling frequency formulation for 4D Gaussian Splatting and introduce a 4D scale-adaptive filter and scale loss, which flexibly regulates the sampling frequency of 4D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach eliminates high-frequency artifacts under increased rendering frequencies while effectively reducing redundant Gaussians in multi-view video reconstruction. We validate the proposed method through monocular and multi-view video reconstruction experiments.Ours project page: https://4d-alias-free.github.io/4D-Alias-free/

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, which lead to instability in model training. Existing methods typically rely on global noise assumptions or confidence-based sample selection, which inadequately mitigate the performance degradation caused by annotation noise, especially in challenging boundary regions. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy ground-truth labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BPGO通过引入语义先验锚点显式建模奖励不确定性，在GRPO框架基础上进行两层自适应优化：组间贝叶斯信任分配强调与先验一致的组更新，组内先验锚定重归一化通过扩展置信偏差和压缩不确定分数来锐化样本区分度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO性能受限于文本-视觉对应关系的模糊性：单个提示可能有效描述多种视觉输出，单个图像/视频可能支持多种同等正确的解释。这种多对多关系导致奖励模型产生不确定和弱区分性信号，使GRPO未能充分利用可靠反馈并过度拟合噪声。

Method: BPGO在GRPO基础上引入语义先验锚点显式建模奖励不确定性，采用两层自适应优化：1）组间贝叶斯信任分配，强调与先验一致的组更新，降低模糊组的权重；2）组内先验锚定重归一化，通过扩展置信偏差和压缩不确定分数来锐化样本区分度。

Result: 在图像和视频生成任务中，BPGO相比标准GRPO及其变体，始终提供更强的语义对齐、增强的感知保真度和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: BPGO通过显式建模奖励不确定性并引入语义先验锚点，有效解决了GRPO中文本-视觉对应关系模糊性带来的性能限制问题，在视觉生成任务中实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as an effective and lightweight framework for post-training visual generative models. However, its performance is fundamentally limited by the ambiguity of textual visual correspondence: a single prompt may validly describe diverse visual outputs, and a single image or video may support multiple equally correct interpretations. This many to many relationship leads reward models to generate uncertain and weakly discriminative signals, causing GRPO to underutilize reliable feedback and overfit noisy ones. We introduce Bayesian Prior-Guided Optimization (BPGO), a novel extension of GRPO that explicitly models reward uncertainty through a semantic prior anchor. BPGO adaptively modulates optimization trust at two levels: inter-group Bayesian trust allocation emphasizes updates from groups consistent with the prior while down-weighting ambiguous ones, and intra-group prior-anchored renormalization sharpens sample distinctions by expanding confident deviations and compressing uncertain scores. Across both image and video generation tasks, BPGO delivers consistently stronger semantic alignment, enhanced perceptual fidelity, and faster convergence than standard GRPO and recent variants.

TL;DR: 提出了MASS方法，通过将物理世界上下文线索转化为可解释表示来增强视觉语言模型在物理推理任务上的表现，并构建了MASS-Bench基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在涉及运动动力学和空间交互的物理驱动推理任务上表现不佳，这限制了它们解释真实或AI生成视频内容以及生成物理一致内容的能力。

Method: MASS方法通过深度基3D编码和视觉接地将时空信号注入VLM语言空间，结合运动跟踪器捕捉对象动态，并应用强化微调加强跨模态对齐和推理。

Result: 改进后的VLM在物理推理和理解任务上比可比和更大的基线模型以及先前最先进模型分别提升了8.7%和6.0%，性能接近闭源SoTA VLM如Gemini-2.5-Flash。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VLMs在物理推理方面的局限性，验证了将物理世界上下文转化为可解释表示的方法的有效性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on standard video tasks but struggle with physics-driven reasoning involving motion dynamics and spatial interactions. This limitation reduces their ability to interpret real or AI-generated content (AIGC) videos and to generate physically consistent content. We present an approach that addresses this gap by translating physical-world context cues into interpretable representations aligned with VLMs' perception, comprehension, and reasoning. We introduce MASS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 4,350 real-world and AIGC videos and 8,361 free-form video question-answering pairs focused on physics-related comprehension tasks, with detailed annotations including visual detections, sub-segment grounding, and full-sequence 3D motion tracking of entities. We further present MASS, a model-agnostic method that injects spatial-temporal signals into the VLM language space via depth-based 3D encoding and visual grounding, coupled with a motion tracker for object dynamics. To strengthen cross-modal alignment and reasoning, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning. Experiments and ablations show that our refined VLMs outperform comparable and larger baselines, as well as prior state-of-the-art models, by 8.7% and 6.0%, achieving performance comparable to close-source SoTA VLMs such as Gemini-2.5-Flash on physics reasoning and comprehension. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: CompGen框架有效提升了T2I系统的组合生成能力，证明了课程学习在解决组合合成问题中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has long been an open problem, with compositional synthesis remaining particularly challenging. This task requires accurate rendering of complex scenes containing multiple objects that exhibit diverse attributes as well as intricate spatial and semantic relationships, demanding both precise object placement and coherent inter-object interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel compositional curriculum reinforcement learning framework named CompGen that addresses compositional weakness in existing T2I models. Specifically, we leverage scene graphs to establish a novel difficulty criterion for compositional ability and develop a corresponding adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo graph sampling algorithm. This difficulty-aware approach enables the synthesis of training curriculum data that progressively optimize T2I models through reinforcement learning. We integrate our curriculum learning approach into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and investigate different curriculum scheduling strategies. Our experiments reveal that CompGen exhibits distinct scaling curves under different curriculum scheduling strategies, with easy-to-hard and Gaussian sampling strategies yielding superior scaling performance compared to random sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CompGen significantly enhances compositional generation capabilities for both diffusion-based and auto-regressive T2I models, highlighting its effectiveness in improving the compositional T2I generation systems.

Motivation: Mamba作为视觉任务的有效骨干网络，其内在机制在视觉领域仍未被充分理解，需要系统研究其表征特性。

Method: 理论分析Mamba与Softmax和Linear Attention的关系；提出二元分割指标评估激活图；利用DINO进行自监督预训练。

Result: 确认Mamba可作为Softmax Attention的低秩近似；新指标证明Mamba能建模长程依赖；自监督方法获得更清晰的激活图；在ImageNet上达到78.5%的线性探测准确率。

Conclusion: 本研究为基于Mamba的视觉架构提供了有价值的见解，展示了其在可解释性和性能方面的潜力。

Abstract: Mamba has recently garnered attention as an effective backbone for vision tasks. However, its underlying mechanism in visual domains remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate Mamba's representational properties and make three primary contributions. First, we theoretically analyze Mamba's relationship to Softmax and Linear Attention, confirming that it can be viewed as a low-rank approximation of Softmax Attention and thereby bridging the representational gap between Softmax and Linear forms. Second, we introduce a novel binary segmentation metric for activation map evaluation, extending qualitative assessments to a quantitative measure that demonstrates Mamba's capacity to model long-range dependencies. Third, by leveraging DINO for self-supervised pretraining, we obtain clearer activation maps than those produced by standard supervised approaches, highlighting Mamba's potential for interpretability. Notably, our model also achieves a 78.5 percent linear probing accuracy on ImageNet, underscoring its strong performance. We hope this work can provide valuable insights for future investigations of Mamba-based vision architectures.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于注意力的架构和零样本学习方法能否弥合植物病害分类中学术数据集与真实农业条件之间的差距。研究发现，虽然CNN在领域偏移下鲁棒性有限，但Vision Transformer通过捕获全局上下文特征表现出更强的泛化能力，而CLIP模型无需任务特定训练即可直接从自然语言描述分类病害，提供了强大的适应性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多依赖PlantVillage数据集，该数据集包含背景统一、图像居中的植物图像。虽然在此数据集上训练的模型准确率高，但往往无法泛化到真实农田图像，造成了研究成果与实际应用需求之间的显著差距。

Method: 评估了三种模型类别：卷积神经网络(CNN)、Vision Transformer和基于对比语言-图像预训练(CLIP)的零样本模型。比较了它们在领域偏移下的表现和泛化能力。

Result: CNN在领域偏移下表现出有限的鲁棒性；Vision Transformer通过捕获全局上下文特征展现出更强的泛化能力；CLIP模型无需任务特定训练即可直接从自然语言描述分类病害，提供了强大的适应性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 零样本学习作为一种实用且可扩展的领域适应策略，在多样化田间环境中的植物健康诊断方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled significant progress in plant disease classification using leaf images. Much of the existing research in this field has relied on the PlantVillage dataset, which consists of well-centered plant images captured against uniform, uncluttered backgrounds. Although models trained on this dataset achieve high accuracy, they often fail to generalize to real-world field images, such as those submitted by farmers to plant diagnostic systems. This has created a significant gap between published studies and practical application requirements, highlighting the necessity of investigating and addressing this issue. In this study, we investigate whether attention-based architectures and zero-shot learning approaches can bridge the gap between curated academic datasets and real-world agricultural conditions in plant disease classification. We evaluate three model categories: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers, and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based zero-shot models. While CNNs exhibit limited robustness under domain shift, Vision Transformers demonstrate stronger generalization by capturing global contextual features. Most notably, CLIP models classify diseases directly from natural language descriptions without any task-specific training, offering strong adaptability and interpretability. These findings highlight the potential of zero-shot learning as a practical and scalable domain adaptation strategy for plant health diagnosis in diverse field environments.

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于消除训练和微调开源视频基础模型的关键障碍，并为构建高质量和可泛化的视频-文本数据集提供了见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has surged in interest since Sora, yet open-source models still face a data bottleneck: there is no large, high-quality, easily obtainable video-text corpus. Existing public datasets typically require manual YouTube crawling, which yields low usable volume due to link rot and access limits, and raises licensing uncertainty. This work addresses this challenge by introducing ViMix-14M, a curated multi-source video-text dataset of around 14 million pairs that provides crawl-free, download-ready access and long-form, high-quality captions tightly aligned to video. ViMix-14M is built by merging diverse open video sources, followed by unified de-duplication and quality filtering, and a multi-granularity, ground-truth-guided re-captioning pipeline that refines descriptions to better match actions, scenes, and temporal structure. We evaluate the dataset by multimodal retrieval, text-to-video generation, and video question answering tasks, observing consistent improvements over counterpart datasets. We hope this work can help removing the key barrier to training and fine-tuning open-source video foundation models, and provide insights of building high-quality and generalizable video-text datasets.

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) plays a crucial role in evaluating and optimizing visual experience. Most existing BIQA approaches fuse shallow and deep features extracted from backbone networks, while overlooking the unequal contributions to quality prediction. Moreover, while various vision encoder backbones are widely adopted in BIQA, the effective quality decoding architectures remain underexplored. To address these limitations, this paper investigates the contributions of shallow and deep features to BIQA, and proposes a effective quality feature decoding framework via GCN-enhanced \underline{l}ayer\underline{i}nteraction and MoE-based \underline{f}eature d\underline{e}coupling, termed \textbf{(Life-IQA)}. Specifically, the GCN-enhanced layer interaction module utilizes the GCN-enhanced deepest-layer features as query and the penultimate-layer features as key, value, then performs cross-attention to achieve feature interaction. Moreover, a MoE-based feature decoupling module is proposed to decouple fused representations though different experts specialized for specific distortion types or quality dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Life-IQA shows more favorable balance between accuracy and cost than a vanilla Transformer decoder and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple BIQA benchmarks.The code is available at: \href{https://github.com/TANGLONG2/Life-IQA/tree/main}{\texttt{Life-IQA}}.

Conclusion: 提出的CSD任务和MC-DiSNet方法解决了传统语义变化检测的局限性，在冲突区域损坏评估中表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurately and swiftly assessing damage from conflicts is crucial for humanitarian aid and regional stability. In conflict zones, damaged zones often share similar architectural styles, with damage typically covering small areas and exhibiting blurred boundaries. These characteristics lead to limited data, annotation difficulties, and significant recognition challenges, including high intra-class similarity and ambiguous semantic changes. To address these issues, we introduce a pre-trained DINOv3 model and propose a multi-scale cross-attention difference siamese network (MC-DiSNet). The powerful visual representation capability of the DINOv3 backbone enables robust and rich feature extraction from bi-temporal remote sensing images. We also release a new Gaza-change dataset containing high-resolution satellite image pairs from 2023-2024 with pixel-level semantic change annotations. It is worth emphasizing that our annotations only include semantic pixels of changed areas. Unlike conventional semantic change detection (SCD), our approach eliminates the need for large-scale semantic annotations of bi-temporal images, instead focusing directly on the changed regions. We term this new task change semantic detection (CSD). The CSD task represents a direct extension of binary change detection (BCD). Due to the limited spatial extent of semantic regions, it presents greater challenges than traditional SCD tasks. We evaluated our method under the CSD framework on both the Gaza-Change and SECOND datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively addresses the CSD task, and its outstanding performance paves the way for practical applications in rapid damage assessment across conflict zones.

Abstract: We have introduced SegSplat, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between rapid, feed-forward 3D reconstruction and rich, open-vocabulary semantic understanding. By constructing a compact semantic memory bank from multi-view 2D foundation model features and predicting discrete semantic indices alongside geometric and appearance attributes for each 3D Gaussian in a single pass, SegSplat efficiently imbues scenes with queryable semantics. Our experiments demonstrate that SegSplat achieves geometric fidelity comparable to state-of-the-art feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting methods while simultaneously enabling robust open-set semantic segmentation, crucially \textit{without} requiring any per-scene optimization for semantic feature integration. This work represents a significant step towards practical, on-the-fly generation of semantically aware 3D environments, vital for advancing robotic interaction, augmented reality, and other intelligent systems.

Method: 提出类原型学习(CPL)方法，通过学习更具代表性的类别原型来增强CLIP模型的分类能力，使用简单的损失函数在弱监督下进行训练。

Conclusion: 弱到强的泛化方法在视觉语言模型中同样有效，CPL方法在弱监督下能够显著提升CLIP模型的分类性能，特别是在预训练资源有限的情况下。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.

TL;DR: MeanFlow通过联合学习瞬时和平均速度场实现少步高质量生成，但训练动态不明确。分析发现瞬时速度是学习平均速度的前提，小时间间隔下平均速度有助于瞬时速度学习，但大间隔会降低性能。基于此设计了加速瞬时速度形成并逐步转向长间隔平均速度的训练方案，显著提升少步生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MeanFlow虽然承诺在少步内实现高质量生成建模，但其训练动态机制尚不明确，需要深入分析瞬时速度与平均速度之间的相互作用，以指导更有效的训练策略设计。

Method: 分析瞬时速度与平均速度的相互作用关系，发现瞬时速度是学习平均速度的前提条件，小间隔平均速度有助于瞬时速度学习，但大间隔会降低性能。基于这些观察设计训练方案：先加速瞬时速度形成，然后逐步从短间隔转向长间隔平均速度学习。

Result: 增强的MeanFlow训练实现了更快的收敛和显著更好的少步生成性能：使用相同DiT-XL骨干网络，在1-NFE ImageNet 256x256上达到FID 2.87，优于基线方法的3.43。或者，在训练时间缩短2.5倍或使用更小的DiT-L骨干网络时，仍能匹配基线性能。

Conclusion: 瞬时速度和平均速度之间存在复杂的相互作用关系，通过精心设计的训练策略可以显著提升MeanFlow的性能，实现更快的收敛和更好的少步生成质量，为高效生成建模提供了重要指导。

Abstract: MeanFlow promises high-quality generative modeling in few steps, by jointly learning instantaneous and average velocity fields. Yet, the underlying training dynamics remain unclear. We analyze the interaction between the two velocities and find: (i) well-established instantaneous velocity is a prerequisite for learning average velocity; (ii) learning of instantaneous velocity benefits from average velocity when the temporal gap is small, but degrades as the gap increases; and (iii) task-affinity analysis indicates that smooth learning of large-gap average velocities, essential for one-step generation, depends on the prior formation of accurate instantaneous and small-gap average velocities. Guided by these observations, we design an effective training scheme that accelerates the formation of instantaneous velocity, then shifts emphasis from short- to long-interval average velocity. Our enhanced MeanFlow training yields faster convergence and significantly better few-step generation: With the same DiT-XL backbone, our method reaches an impressive FID of 2.87 on 1-NFE ImageNet 256x256, compared to 3.43 for the conventional MeanFlow baseline. Alternatively, our method matches the performance of the MeanFlow baseline with 2.5x shorter training time, or with a smaller DiT-L backbone.

TL;DR: DynaMix是一种新颖的可泛化行人重识别方法，通过动态结合手动标注的多摄像头数据和伪标注的大规模单摄像头数据，在三个核心组件支持下实现高效训练和优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法严重依赖有限的多摄像头标注数据，难以实现真正的泛化能力。需要有效利用大规模单摄像头数据来提升模型在未见摄像头和环境下的识别能力。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：1) 动态重标注模块优化单摄像头身份的伪标签；2) 高效质心模块在大身份空间下维护鲁棒的身份表示；3) 数据采样模块精心组合混合数据批次以平衡学习复杂性和批内多样性。

Result: 在大量实验验证中，DynaMix在可泛化行人重识别任务上持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DynaMix通过动态适应训练数据的结构和噪声，有效结合多摄像头和单摄像头数据，实现了在可泛化行人重识别任务上的显著性能提升。

Abstract: Generalizable person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to recognize individuals across unseen cameras and environments. While existing methods rely heavily on limited labeled multi-camera data, we propose DynaMix, a novel method that effectively combines manually labeled multi-camera and large-scale pseudo-labeled single-camera data. Unlike prior works, DynaMix dynamically adapts to the structure and noise of the training data through three core components: (1) a Relabeling Module that refines pseudo-labels of single-camera identities on-the-fly; (2) an Efficient Centroids Module that maintains robust identity representations under a large identity space; and (3) a Data Sampling Module that carefully composes mixed data mini-batches to balance learning complexity and intra-batch diversity. All components are specifically designed to operate efficiently at scale, enabling effective training on millions of images and hundreds of thousands of identities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generalizable person Re-ID.

*Haonan Wang,Hanyu Zhou,Haoyue Liu,Luxin Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出4D-VGGT模型，通过分治时空表示解决动态场景几何估计中的空间和时间特征不匹配问题，支持多设置输入、多级表示和多任务预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将空间和时间特征对齐到统一潜在空间中，但由于这两种特征的异构性，会导致表示不匹配的问题。

Method: 设计自适应视觉网格支持任意视图和时间步输入；提出跨视图全局融合用于空间表示，跨时间局部融合用于时间表示；添加多个任务特定头部实现多任务预测。

Result: 在多个动态场景几何基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，模型具有更好的特征区分能力和应用普适性。

Conclusion: 4D-VGGT通过分治时空表示的统一框架，成功解决了动态场景几何估计中的特征表示问题，并在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We investigate a challenging task of dynamic scene geometry estimation, which requires representing both spatial and temporal features. Typically, existing methods align the two features into a unified latent space to model scene geometry. However, this unified paradigm suffers from potential mismatched representation due to the heterogeneous nature between spatial and temporal features. In this work, we propose 4D-VGGT, a general foundation model with divide-and-conquer spatiotemporal representation for dynamic scene geometry. Our model is divided into three aspects: 1) Multi-setting input. We design an adaptive visual grid that supports input sequences with arbitrary numbers of views and time steps. 2) Multi-level representation. We propose a cross-view global fusion for spatial representation and a cross-time local fusion for temporal representation. 3) Multi-task prediction. We append multiple task-specific heads to spatiotemporal representations, enabling a comprehensive visual geometry estimation for dynamic scenes. Under this unified framework, these components enhance the feature discriminability and application universality of our model for dynamic scenes. In addition, we integrate multiple geometry datasets to train our model and conduct extensive experiments to verify the effectiveness of our method across various tasks on multiple dynamic scene geometry benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeuroVascU-Net是一种专门用于从T1CE MRI中分割脑血管的深度学习架构，通过多尺度特征融合和跨域自适应特征融合模块，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑血管分割方法要么依赖耗时的手动标注，要么在准确性和计算成本之间难以平衡，特别是缺乏专门针对神经肿瘤患者T1CE MRI的自动化分割方案。

Method: 基于扩张U-Net架构，集成了多尺度上下文特征融合模块和跨域自适应特征融合模块，通过多尺度扩张卷积捕获局部和全局信息，动态整合领域特定特征。

Result: 在137名脑肿瘤活检患者的T1CE扫描数据集上，NeuroVascU-Net获得了0.8609的Dice分数和0.8841的精确度，仅需12.4M参数，显著少于基于transformer的模型。

Conclusion: NeuroVascU-Net在准确性和效率之间取得了良好平衡，为计算机辅助神经外科规划提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Precise 3D segmentation of cerebral vasculature from T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) MRI is crucial for safe neurosurgical planning. Manual delineation is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while current automated methods often trade accuracy for computational cost, limiting clinical use. We present NeuroVascU-Net, the first deep learning architecture specifically designed to segment cerebrovascular structures directly from clinically standard T1CE MRI in neuro-oncology patients, addressing a gap in prior work dominated by TOF-MRA-based approaches. NeuroVascU-Net builds on a dilated U-Net and integrates two specialized modules: a Multi-Scale Contextual Feature Fusion ($MSC^2F$) module at the bottleneck and a Cross-Domain Adaptive Feature Fusion ($CDA^2F$) module at deeper hierarchical layers. $MSC^2F$ captures both local and global information via multi-scale dilated convolutions, while $CDA^2F$ dynamically integrates domain-specific features, enhancing representation while keeping computation low. The model was trained and validated on a curated dataset of T1CE scans from 137 brain tumor biopsy patients, annotated by a board-certified functional neurosurgeon. NeuroVascU-Net achieved a Dice score of 0.8609 and precision of 0.8841, accurately segmenting both major and fine vascular structures. Notably, it requires only 12.4M parameters, significantly fewer than transformer-based models such as Swin U-NetR. This balance of accuracy and efficiency positions NeuroVascU-Net as a practical solution for computer-assisted neurosurgical planning.

TL;DR: CrossJEPA是一种简单的跨模态联合嵌入预测架构，利用图像基础模型的知识，通过预测特定渲染2D视图的嵌入来训练3D点云表示，在计算效率和性能上达到新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前利用2D数据的3D表示学习方法模型庞大、训练缓慢、计算成本高的问题，探索JEPA架构在跨模态学习中的潜力。

Method: 提出CrossJEPA架构，利用冻结的图像基础模型作为教师，训练3D点云编码器预测对应2D视图的嵌入，采用跨域投影信息净化监督信号，并设计一次性目标嵌入缓存机制提高效率。

Result: 在ModelNet40上达到94.2%的线性探测准确率，在ScanObjectNN上达到88.3%，仅使用14.1M预训练参数（点编码器8.5M），在单GPU上约6小时完成预训练。

Conclusion: CrossJEPA是一个性能优异、内存高效、训练快速的3D表示学习框架，通过知识蒸馏实现了计算效率和性能的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Image-to-point cross-modal learning has emerged to address the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets in 3D representation learning. However, current methods that leverage 2D data often result in large, slow-to-train models, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy in resource-constrained environments. The architecture design of such models is therefore critical, determining their performance, memory footprint, and compute efficiency. The Joint-embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) has gained wide popularity in self-supervised learning for its simplicity and efficiency, but has been under-explored in cross-modal settings, partly due to the misconception that masking is intrinsic to JEPA. In this light, we propose CrossJEPA, a simple Cross-modal Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that harnesses the knowledge of an image foundation model and trains a predictor to infer embeddings of specific rendered 2D views from corresponding 3D point clouds, thereby introducing a JEPA-style pretraining strategy beyond masking. By conditioning the predictor on cross-domain projection information, CrossJEPA purifies the supervision signal from semantics exclusive to the target domain. We further exploit the frozen teacher design with a one-time target embedding caching mechanism, yielding amortized efficiency. CrossJEPA achieves a new state-of-the-art in linear probing on the synthetic ModelNet40 (94.2%) and the real-world ScanObjectNN (88.3%) benchmarks, using only 14.1M pretraining parameters (8.5M in the point encoder), and about 6 pretraining hours on a standard single GPU. These results position CrossJEPA as a performant, memory-efficient, and fast-to-train framework for 3D representation learning via knowledge distillation. We analyze CrossJEPA intuitively, theoretically, and empirically, and extensively ablate our design choices. Code will be made available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中存在大量矛盾的多模态输入，但现有基准通常假设输入一致性，无法评估跨模态矛盾检测这一防止幻觉和确保可靠性的基本能力。

Method: 构建CLASH基准，包含COCO图像与矛盾标题配对，提供经过自动质量检查的精细调优集和人工验证的诊断集，分析最先进模型在识别跨模态冲突方面的表现。

Result: 分析显示最先进模型在识别跨模态冲突方面存在显著局限性，暴露出系统性模态偏见和类别特定弱点。针对CLASH的精细调优显著增强了冲突检测能力。

Conclusion: CLASH基准揭示了当前多模态模型在矛盾检测方面的不足，通过针对性训练可以显著提升模型的跨模态冲突识别能力。

Abstract: Contradictory multimodal inputs are common in real-world settings, yet existing benchmarks typically assume input consistency and fail to evaluate cross-modal contradiction detection - a fundamental capability for preventing hallucinations and ensuring reliability. We introduce CLASH, a novel benchmark for multimodal contradiction detection, featuring COCO images paired with contradictory captions containing controlled object-level or attribute-level contradictions. The samples include targeted questions evaluated in both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. The benchmark provides an extensive fine-tuning set filtered through automated quality checks, alongside a smaller human-verified diagnostic set. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models reveals substantial limitations in recognizing cross-modal conflicts, exposing systematic modality biases and category-specific weaknesses. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that targeted fine-tuning on CLASH substantially enhances conflict detection capabilities.

TL;DR: 研究发现前沿视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中对视觉信息的依赖程度存在显著差异，GPT-4o表现出最强的视觉基础性，而其他模型更多依赖文本捷径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答基准上表现出色，但其是否真正依赖视觉信息仍不明确，需要验证模型是否真正整合视觉和文本信息。

Method: 使用欧洲医学问答意大利数据集的60个明确需要图像解释的问题，将正确的医学图像替换为空白占位符，测试四个最先进模型（Claude Sonnet 4.5、GPT-4o、GPT-5-mini和Gemini 2.0 flash exp）的视觉依赖程度。

Result: GPT-4o显示出最强的视觉基础性，准确率下降27.9个百分点（从83.2%降至55.3%），而GPT-5-mini、Gemini和Claude的准确率下降幅度较小，分别为8.5pp、2.4pp和5.6pp。所有模型都生成了对虚构视觉解释的自信推理。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在视觉依赖方面存在关键差异，模型生成虚假视觉解释的自信推理表明需要严格的评估才能进行临床部署。

Abstract: Large vision language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on medical visual question answering benchmarks, yet their reliance on visual information remains unclear. We investigate whether frontier VLMs demonstrate genuine visual grounding when answering Italian medical questions by testing four state-of-the-art models: Claude Sonnet 4.5, GPT-4o, GPT-5-mini, and Gemini 2.0 flash exp. Using 60 questions from the EuropeMedQA Italian dataset that explicitly require image interpretation, we substitute correct medical images with blank placeholders to test whether models truly integrate visual and textual information. Our results reveal striking variability in visual dependency: GPT-4o shows the strongest visual grounding with a 27.9pp accuracy drop (83.2% [74.6%, 91.7%] to 55.3% [44.1%, 66.6%]), while GPT-5-mini, Gemini, and Claude maintain high accuracy with modest drops of 8.5pp, 2.4pp, and 5.6pp respectively. Analysis of model-generated reasoning reveals confident explanations for fabricated visual interpretations across all models, suggesting varying degrees of reliance on textual shortcuts versus genuine visual analysis. These findings highlight critical differences in model robustness and the need for rigorous evaluation before clinical deployment.

Motivation: 随着人脸生成技术的发展，伪造方法日益多样化。增量伪造检测需要不断更新模型以适应新数据，但现有基于样本回放的方法存在多样性低和隐私问题。生成回放提供了潜在解决方案，但其在伪造检测中的可行性尚不明确。

Method: 提出领域感知相对加权策略，包含两个关键组件：对领域安全样本直接监督，对领域风险样本应用相对分离损失来平衡监督和潜在混淆。通过领域混淆分数动态调整这种权衡。

Result: 大量实验表明，DARW在不同生成回放设置下持续提升了伪造检测的增量学习性能，并缓解了领域重叠的不利影响。

Conclusion: 生成回放在伪造检测中具有可行性，通过领域感知方法可以有效利用生成回放来提升增量学习效果，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of face generation techniques has led to a growing variety of forgery methods. Incremental forgery detection aims to gradually update existing models with new forgery data, yet current sample replay-based methods are limited by low diversity and privacy concerns. Generative replay offers a potential solution by synthesizing past data, but its feasibility for forgery detection remains unclear. In this work, we systematically investigate generative replay and identify two scenarios: when the replay generator closely resembles the new forgery model, generated real samples blur the domain boundary, creating domain-risky samples; when the replay generator differs significantly, generated samples can be safely supervised, forming domain-safe samples. To exploit generative replay effectively, we propose a novel Domain-Aware Relative Weighting (DARW) strategy. DARW directly supervises domain-safe samples while applying a Relative Separation Loss to balance supervision and potential confusion for domain-risky samples. A Domain Confusion Score dynamically adjusts this tradeoff according to sample reliability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DARW consistently improves incremental learning performance for forgery detection under different generative replay settings and alleviates the adverse impact of domain overlap.

Conclusion: DiT-Mem方法成功为视频生成模型注入世界知识，提高了生成视频的物理合理性和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer(DiT) based video generation models have recently achieved impressive visual quality and temporal coherence, but they still frequently violate basic physical laws and commonsense dynamics, revealing a lack of explicit world knowledge. In this work, we explore how to equip them with a plug-and-play memory that injects useful world knowledge. Motivated by in-context memory in Transformer-based LLMs, we conduct empirical studies to show that DiT can be steered via interventions on its hidden states, and simple low-pass and high-pass filters in the embedding space naturally disentangle low-level appearance and high-level physical/semantic cues, enabling targeted guidance. Building on these observations, we propose a learnable memory encoder DiT-Mem, composed of stacked 3D CNNs, low-/high-pass filters, and self-attention layers. The encoder maps reference videos into a compact set of memory tokens, which are concatenated as the memory within the DiT self-attention layers. During training, we keep the diffusion backbone frozen, and only optimize the memory encoder. It yields a rather efficient training process on few training parameters (150M) and 10K data samples, and enables plug-and-play usage at inference time. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in improving physical rule following and video fidelity. Our code and data are publicly released here: https://thrcle421.github.io/DiT-Mem-Web/.

TL;DR: PEARL提出了一种双分支的感知-推理协同方法，通过将多模态推理显式锚定到经过验证的视觉证据上来增强VLM的推理能力，解决了传统RLVR方法忽视视觉感知验证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RLVR方法在VLM中仅验证最终文本输出，忽视了视觉感知这一基础步骤，导致视觉幻觉和奖励欺骗问题。基于错误感知的推理本质上是不可靠的。

Method: PEARL为每个推理导向的QA实例首先推导感知检查清单——一组具有可验证答案的感知导向子问题，用于探测模型对关键视觉证据的理解。在训练过程中，通过感知检查清单的辅助rollout产生感知奖励，既直接增强模型的感知能力，又作为推理的保真度门控。

Result: 综合实验显示PEARL在多模态推理基准上取得了显著提升，如在MathVerse上相比基线提升了+9.7%，相比GRPO提升了+6.6%。

Conclusion: PEARL能够无缝集成到流行的RL方法中，通过显式锚定推理到经过验证的视觉证据，有效解决了VLM中的视觉幻觉问题，显著提升了多模态推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and is now being applied to Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, vanilla RLVR for VLMs verifies only the final textual output, critically neglecting the foundational step of visual perception. This oversight leads to visual hallucinations and reward hacking, as reasoning built upon flawed perception is inherently unreliable. To address this, we propose PEARL (Perceptual-Evidence Anchored Reinforced Learning), a dual-branch, perception-reasoning synergistic that strengthens multimodal reasoning by explicitly anchoring it to verified visual evidence. For each reasoning-oriented QA instance, PEARL first derive a perception checklist -- a set of perception-oriented sub-questions with verifiable answers that probe the model's understanding of key visual evidence. During training, auxiliary rollouts on this checklist yield a perceptual reward that both directly reinforces the model's perception ability and acts as a fidelity gate for reasoning. If the model passes the perception check, its policy update is biased towards evidence-anchored reasoning. Otherwise, the process is halted to prevent reasoning from flawed premises. PEARL can be seamlessly integrated with popular RL methods like GRPO and DAPO. Comprehensive experiments show PEARL achieves substantial gains on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, e.g., a +9.7% improvement over the baseline and +6.6% over GRPO on MathVerse.

Conclusion: 这是首个在物理真实的全模拟3D场景中研究货运占用率估计对抗补丁攻击的工作，揭示了物流自动化管道安全风险并指出了增强物理鲁棒性的方向。

Abstract: Computer vision systems are increasingly adopted in modern logistics operations, including the estimation of trailer occupancy for planning, routing, and billing. Although effective, such systems may be vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patches that can be printed and placed on interior surfaces. In this work, we study the feasibility of such attacks on a convolutional cargo-occupancy classifier using fully simulated 3D environments. Using Mitsuba 3 for differentiable rendering, we optimize patch textures across variations in geometry, lighting, and viewpoint, and compare their effectiveness to a 2D compositing baseline. Our experiments demonstrate that 3D-optimized patches achieve high attack success rates, especially in a denial-of-service scenario (empty to full), where success reaches 84.94 percent. Concealment attacks (full to empty) prove more challenging but still reach 30.32 percent. We analyze the factors influencing attack success, discuss implications for the security of automated logistics pipelines, and highlight directions for strengthening physical robustness. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate adversarial patch attacks for cargo-occupancy estimation in physically realistic, fully simulated 3D scenes.

Method: 引入SineProject方法，在冻结投影器中添加正弦调制的可训练参数，改善Jacobian矩阵的谱条件数，稳定跨模态嵌入对齐。

Result: 在LLaVA v1.5 7B和13B模型的安全和隐私遗忘基准测试中，SineProject显著减少良性查询拒绝，同时实现目标信息的完全遗忘，达到最优的遗忘-保留权衡。

Conclusion: SineProject以可忽略的计算开销，在多模态大语言模型遗忘任务中实现了最先进的性能，有效解决了遗忘过程中的视觉语言对齐破坏问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly need to forget specific knowledge such as unsafe or private information without requiring full retraining. However, existing unlearning methods often disrupt vision language alignment, causing models to reject both harmful and benign queries. We trace this failure to the projector network during unlearning, its Jacobian becomes severely illconditioned, leading to unstable optimization and drift in cross modal embeddings. We introduce SineProject, a simple method that augments the frozen projector with sinusoidally modulated trainable parameters, improving the Jacobian's spectral conditioning and stabilizing alignment throughout unlearning. Across standard safety and privacy unlearning benchmarks using LLaVA v1.5 7B and 13B, SineProject reduces benign query refusals while achieving complete forgetting of targeted information, yielding state of the art forget retain trade offs with negligible computational overhead.

Conclusion: 当前的数据集水印方法在实际应用中仍存在脆弱性，需要进一步研究来应对现实威胁场景，确保扩散模型的可追溯性和安全性。

Abstract: Recent fine-tuning techniques for diffusion models enable them to reproduce specific image sets, such as particular faces or artistic styles, but also introduce copyright and security risks. Dataset watermarking has been proposed to ensure traceability by embedding imperceptible watermarks into training images, which remain detectable in outputs even after fine-tuning. However, current methods lack a unified evaluation framework. To address this, this paper establishes a general threat model and introduces a comprehensive evaluation framework encompassing Universality, Transmissibility, and Robustness. Experiments show that existing methods perform well in universality and transmissibility, and exhibit some robustness against common image processing operations, yet still fall short under real-world threat scenarios. To reveal these vulnerabilities, the paper further proposes a practical watermark removal method that fully eliminates dataset watermarks without affecting fine-tuning, highlighting a key challenge for future research.

Result: 评估了GPT-5、Gemini-2.5 Pro、Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL3和EventGPT等模型，发现事件型MLLMs在事件流理解方面表现强劲，但在细粒度识别和3D空间推理方面存在明显不足。

Conclusion: EventBench为事件视觉领域提供了首个全面评估基准，揭示了当前事件型MLLMs的能力差距，特别是在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant advancements in event-based vision, yet the comprehensive evaluation of their capabilities within a unified benchmark remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EventBench, a benchmark that offers eight diverse task metrics together with a large-scale event stream dataset. EventBench differs from existing event-based benchmarks in four key aspects: (1) openness in accessibility, releasing all raw event streams and task instructions across eight evaluation metrics; (2) diversity in task coverage, spanning understanding, recognition, and spatial reasoning tasks for comprehensive capability assessment; (3) integration in spatial dimensions, pioneering the design of 3D spatial reasoning tasks for event-based MLLMs; and (4) scale in data volume, with an accompanying training set of over one million event-text pairs supporting large-scale training and evaluation. Using EventBench, we evaluate state-of-the-art closed-source models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5 Pro, leading open-source models including Qwen2.5-VL and InternVL3, and event-based MLLMs such as EventGPT that directly process raw event streams. Extensive evaluation reveals that while current event-based MLLMs demonstrate strong performance in event stream understanding, they continue to struggle with fine-grained recognition and spatial reasoning.

*Zehong Ma,Longhui Wei,Shuai Wang,Shiliang Zhang,Qi Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeCo提出了一种频率解耦的像素扩散框架，通过将高频细节和低频语义解耦生成，使用轻量级像素解码器生成高频细节，让DiT专注于低频语义建模，实现了更高效的像素扩散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有像素扩散模型训练和推理速度慢，因为它们在单一扩散变换器中同时建模高频信号和低频语义。为了追求更高效的像素扩散范式，需要解耦高频和低频组件的生成。

Method: 提出频率解耦像素扩散框架：使用轻量级像素解码器生成高频细节（以DiT的语义指导为条件），让DiT专注于低频语义建模；引入频率感知流匹配损失，强调视觉显著频率并抑制不显著频率。

Result: 在ImageNet上达到FID 1.62（256x256）和2.22（512x512），在像素扩散模型中表现优异，缩小了与潜在扩散方法的差距；预训练的文本到图像模型在GenEval系统级比较中获得0.86的领先总分。

Conclusion: DeCo通过频率解耦策略实现了高效的像素扩散，在保持高质量生成的同时显著提升了效率，为像素扩散模型提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Pixel diffusion aims to generate images directly in pixel space in an end-to-end fashion. This approach avoids the limitations of VAE in the two-stage latent diffusion, offering higher model capacity. Existing pixel diffusion models suffer from slow training and inference, as they usually model both high-frequency signals and low-frequency semantics within a single diffusion transformer (DiT). To pursue a more efficient pixel diffusion paradigm, we propose the frequency-DeCoupled pixel diffusion framework. With the intuition to decouple the generation of high and low frequency components, we leverage a lightweight pixel decoder to generate high-frequency details conditioned on semantic guidance from the DiT. This thus frees the DiT to specialize in modeling low-frequency semantics. In addition, we introduce a frequency-aware flow-matching loss that emphasizes visually salient frequencies while suppressing insignificant ones. Extensive experiments show that DeCo achieves superior performance among pixel diffusion models, attaining FID of 1.62 (256x256) and 2.22 (512x512) on ImageNet, closing the gap with latent diffusion methods. Furthermore, our pretrained text-to-image model achieves a leading overall score of 0.86 on GenEval in system-level comparison. Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/Zehong-Ma/DeCo.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAF是一种零样本视觉基础模型特征上采样方法，通过跨尺度邻域注意力和旋转位置编码学习自适应空间-内容权重，无需重新训练即可提升任何VFM的特征分辨率，在多个下游任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有上采样方法面临基本权衡：经典滤波器速度快但依赖固定形式，现代上采样器精度高但需要为每个VFM重新训练。需要一种既能保持高精度又无需重新训练的通用上采样方法。

Method: 提出邻域注意力滤波(NAF)，通过跨尺度邻域注意力和旋转位置编码学习自适应空间-内容权重，仅由高分辨率输入图像引导，实现零样本特征上采样。

Result: NAF是首个VFM无关架构，在多个下游任务中超越VFM特定上采样器并达到最先进性能，高效支持2K特征图，以18FPS重建中间分辨率图，在图像恢复任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: NAF成功解决了VFM特征上采样的基本权衡问题，提供了一种高效、通用且高性能的零样本上采样解决方案，展现了在特征上采样和图像恢复等多任务中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) extract spatially downsampled representations, posing challenges for pixel-level tasks. Existing upsampling approaches face a fundamental trade-off: classical filters are fast and broadly applicable but rely on fixed forms, while modern upsamplers achieve superior accuracy through learnable, VFM-specific forms at the cost of retraining for each VFM. We introduce Neighborhood Attention Filtering (NAF), which bridges this gap by learning adaptive spatial-and-content weights through Cross-Scale Neighborhood Attention and Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), guided solely by the high-resolution input image. NAF operates zero-shot: it upsamples features from any VFM without retraining, making it the first VFM-agnostic architecture to outperform VFM-specific upsamplers and achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple downstream tasks. It maintains high efficiency, scaling to 2K feature maps and reconstructing intermediate-resolution maps at 18 FPS. Beyond feature upsampling, NAF demonstrates strong performance on image restoration, highlighting its versatility. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/valeoai/NAF.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于医学规则的混合管道方法，通过精确测量肿瘤大小和距离属性来进行肺癌分期，而不是将其视为纯图像分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端深度学习方法往往忽略肿瘤-淋巴结-转移系统(TNM)中的空间和解剖信息，而肿瘤分期依赖于多个定量标准，包括肿瘤大小及其与邻近解剖结构的距离。

Method: 使用专门的编码器-解码器网络精确分割肺部和邻近解剖结构，然后通过分析分割掩码提取肿瘤属性，最后应用基于医学指南的规则进行分期。

Result: 在Lung-PET-CT-Dx数据集上评估，总体分类准确率达91.36%，各阶段F1分数分别为T1:0.93、T2:0.89、T3:0.96、T4:0.90。

Conclusion: 这是首个将明确临床背景嵌入肿瘤分期分类的研究，相比传统黑盒CNN方法，既提供最先进性能又具有透明决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer tumor staging is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, it remains challenging for end-to-end deep learning approaches, as such approaches often overlook spatial and anatomical information that are central to the tumor-node-metastasis system. The tumor stage depends on multiple quantitative criteria, including the tumor size and its proximity to the nearest anatomical structures, and small variations can alter the staging outcome. We propose a medically grounded hybrid pipeline that performs staging by explicitly measuring the tumor's size and distance properties rather than treating it as a pure image classification task. Our method employs specialized encoder-decoder networks to precisely segment the lung and adjacent anatomy, including the lobes, tumor, mediastinum, and diaphragm. Subsequently, we extract the necessary tumor properties, i.e. measure the largest tumor dimension and calculate the distance between the tumor and neighboring anatomical structures by a quantitative analysis of the segmentation masks. Finally, we apply rule-based tumor staging aligned with the medical guidelines. This novel framework has been evaluated on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional deep learning models, achieving an overall classification accuracy of 91.36%. We report the per-stage F1-scores of 0.93 (T1), 0.89 (T2), 0.96 (T3), and 0.90 (T4), a critical evaluation aspect often omitted in prior literature. To our knowledge, this is the first study that embeds explicit clinical context into tumor stage classification. Unlike standard convolutional neural networks that operate in an uninterpretable "black box" manner, our method offers both state-of-the-art performance and transparent decision support.

TL;DR: 提出了Video-PLR框架，通过感知循环推理范式和反幻觉奖励机制解决视频推理中的感知不足和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理大语言模型存在感知捷径问题，采用单步感知范式容易导致证据不足和幻觉现象。

Method: 1. 感知循环推理(PLR)：分步骤描述视频片段并分析，决定下一步动作；2. 事实感知评估器(FAE)：作为反幻觉奖励机制评估感知结果。

Result: 在3B和7B参数规模上达到最先进水平，具有最佳数据效率。FAE性能与GPT-4o相当。

Conclusion: Video-PLR框架有效解决了视频推理中的感知不足和幻觉问题，实现了更好的推理性能。

Abstract: Sufficient visual perception is the foundation of video reasoning. Nevertheless, existing Video Reasoning LLMs suffer from perception shortcuts, relying on a flawed single-step perception paradigm. This paradigm describes the video and then conducts reasoning, which runs the risk of insufficient evidence and emergent hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce a new framework that integrates a loop-based paradigm with an anti-hallucination reward. First, to address the insufficient evidence, we introduce the Perception Loop Reasoning (PLR) paradigm. Instead of describing the video at once, each loop requires the model to describe a video segment with precise timestamps, analyze this segment, and decide the next action. Second, for the risk of hallucinations, the Factual-Aware Evaluator (FAE) evaluates each perception result as a reliable anti-hallucination reward. This reward encourages the model to provide sufficient and precise video evidence. Our FAE, which performs comparably to GPT-4o, is tuned on our AnetHallu-117K, a large-scale hallucination judgment preference dataset. Extensive experiments show that our Video-PLR achieves the state-of-the-art in both 3B and 7B parameter scales and has the best data efficiency. Our code, models, and datasets are released on: https://github.com/BoweiPu/VideoPLR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用大规模视频生成模型强大的视觉能力，探索如何通过视觉域中的嵌入式指令来实现更精确可控的图像到视频生成，解决文本提示全局性和粗糙性的限制。

Method: 在视频帧中嵌入视觉信号作为指令，包括覆盖文字、箭头、轨迹等元素，为不同对象分配不同的视觉指令，建立明确的空间对应关系。

Result: 在Veo 3.1、Kling 2.5和Wan 2.2三个先进生成器上的实验表明，视频模型能够可靠地解释和执行这种视觉嵌入式指令，特别是在复杂多对象场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: In-Video Instruction范式能够有效利用视频生成模型的视觉理解能力，为图像到视频生成提供更精确、空间感知的控制方式。

Abstract: Large-scale video generative models have recently demonstrated strong visual capabilities, enabling the prediction of future frames that adhere to the logical and physical cues in the current observation. In this work, we investigate whether such capabilities can be harnessed for controllable image-to-video generation by interpreting visual signals embedded within the frames as instructions, a paradigm we term In-Video Instruction. In contrast to prompt-based control, which provides textual descriptions that are inherently global and coarse, In-Video Instruction encodes user guidance directly into the visual domain through elements such as overlaid text, arrows, or trajectories. This enables explicit, spatial-aware, and unambiguous correspondences between visual subjects and their intended actions by assigning distinct instructions to different objects. Extensive experiments on three state-of-the-art generators, including Veo 3.1, Kling 2.5, and Wan 2.2, show that video models can reliably interpret and execute such visually embedded instructions, particularly in complex multi-object scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然自我中心用户和场景理解研究主要集中在运动和接触交互，但预测人类视觉感知本身仍较少探索，尽管它在指导人类行为和AR/VR、辅助技术中具有基础作用。

Method: EgoSpanLift将SLAM关键点转换为注视兼容几何，提取体积视觉跨度区域，结合3D U-Net和单向transformer进行时空融合预测。

Result: 方法在自我中心2D注视预测和3D定位方面优于竞争基线，即使投影回2D图像平面也取得可比结果，无需额外2D特定训练。

Conclusion: 成功将视觉跨度预测从2D扩展到3D，为AR/VR和辅助技术提供了更准确的视觉感知预测能力。

Abstract: People continuously perceive and interact with their surroundings based on underlying intentions that drive their exploration and behaviors. While research in egocentric user and scene understanding has focused primarily on motion and contact-based interaction, forecasting human visual perception itself remains less explored despite its fundamental role in guiding human actions and its implications for AR/VR and assistive technologies. We address the challenge of egocentric 3D visual span forecasting, predicting where a person's visual perception will focus next within their three-dimensional environment. To this end, we propose EgoSpanLift, a novel method that transforms egocentric visual span forecasting from 2D image planes to 3D scenes. EgoSpanLift converts SLAM-derived keypoints into gaze-compatible geometry and extracts volumetric visual span regions. We further combine EgoSpanLift with 3D U-Net and unidirectional transformers, enabling spatio-temporal fusion to efficiently predict future visual span in the 3D grid. In addition, we curate a comprehensive benchmark from raw egocentric multisensory data, creating a testbed with 364.6K samples for 3D visual span forecasting. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines for egocentric 2D gaze anticipation and 3D localization while achieving comparable results even when projected back onto 2D image planes without additional 2D-specific training.

TL;DR: 提出了AdaPS方法，一种自适应后验扩散采样策略，通过基于两种不同似然梯度近似之间一致性的观测相关权重方案，自动调整扩散过程中的似然步长，无需超参数调优即可在多种成像任务中提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为逆问题的强大生成先验面临关键挑战：需要在先验贡献和数据保真度之间取得平衡，过于激进的似然更新会引入伪影，而保守更新会减慢收敛或产生次优重建。

Method: 开发了基于两种难以处理的中间似然梯度近似之间一致性的观测相关权重方案，该方案自然适应扩散调度、时间重间距和注入的随机性，形成超参数自适应的AdaPS方法。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet-256验证集上的超分辨率、高斯去模糊和运动去模糊等任务中，AdaPS在感知质量上一致超越现有扩散基线，失真度损失最小或无损失，无需任务特定调优。

Conclusion: AdaPS是一种鲁棒且有效的自适应扩散采样方法，对各种扩散步数、观测噪声水平和随机性变化都具有良好适应性，显著提升了逆问题求解的重建质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative priors for solving inverse problems, achieving state-of-the-art results across various imaging tasks. A central challenge in this setting lies in balancing the contribution of the prior with the data fidelity term: overly aggressive likelihood updates may introduce artifacts, while conservative updates can slow convergence or yield suboptimal reconstructions. In this work, we propose an adaptive likelihood step-size strategy to guide the diffusion process for inverse-problem formulations. Specifically, we develop an observation-dependent weighting scheme based on the agreement between two different approximations of the intractable intermediate likelihood gradients, that adapts naturally to the diffusion schedule, time re-spacing, and injected stochasticity. The resulting approach, Adaptive Posterior diffusion Sampling (AdaPS), is hyperparameter-free and improves reconstruction quality across diverse imaging tasks - including super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring - on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet-256 validation sets. AdaPS consistently surpasses existing diffusion-based baselines in perceptual quality with minimal or no loss in distortion, without any task-specific tuning. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate its robustness to the number of diffusion steps, observation noise levels, and varying stochasticity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT)框架，使视觉语言模型能够在连续视觉标记空间中进行推理，解决现有模型在密集视觉感知方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型擅长语言空间推理，但在需要密集视觉感知的任务（如空间推理和几何意识）上表现不佳，因为缺乏捕捉空间维度密集视觉信息的机制。

Method: COVT框架通过约20个紧凑的连续视觉标记编码丰富的感知线索，从轻量级视觉专家中提取知识，捕捉2D外观、3D几何、空间布局和边缘结构等互补属性。训练时模型自回归预测这些视觉标记来重建密集监督信号，推理时直接在连续视觉标记空间进行推理。

Conclusion: 紧凑的连续视觉思考能够实现更精确、更可靠和更可解释的多模态智能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework that enables VLMs to reason not only in words but also through continuous visual tokens-compact latent representations that encode rich perceptual cues. Within a small budget of roughly 20 tokens, COVT distills knowledge from lightweight vision experts, capturing complementary properties such as 2D appearance, 3D geometry, spatial layout, and edge structure. During training, the VLM with COVT autoregressively predicts these visual tokens to reconstruct dense supervision signals (e.g., depth, segmentation, edges, and DINO features). At inference, the model reasons directly in the continuous visual token space, preserving efficiency while optionally decoding dense predictions for interpretability. Evaluated across more than ten diverse perception benchmarks, including CV-Bench, MMVP, RealWorldQA, MMStar, WorldMedQA, and HRBench, integrating COVT into strong VLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL and LLaVA consistently improves performance by 3% to 16% and demonstrates that compact continuous visual thinking enables more precise, grounded, and interpretable multimodal intelligence.

Abstract: Hyperspectral image reconstruction from a compressed measurement is a highly ill-posed inverse problem. Current data-driven methods suffer from hallucination due to the lack of spectral diversity in existing hyperspectral image datasets, particularly when they are evaluated for the metamerism phenomenon. In this work, we formulate hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction as a Bayesian inference problem and propose a framework, HSDiff, that utilizes an unconditionally trained, pixel-level diffusion prior and posterior diffusion sampling to generate diverse HSI samples consistent with the measurements of various hyperspectral image formation models. We propose an enhanced metameric augmentation technique using region-based metameric black and partition-of-union spectral upsampling to expand training with physically valid metameric spectra, strengthening the prior diversity and improving uncertainty calibration. We utilize HSDiff to investigate how the studied forward models shape the posterior distribution and demonstrate that guiding with effective spectral encoding provides calibrated informative uncertainty compared to non-encoded models. Through the lens of the Bayesian framework, HSDiff offers a complete, high-performance method for uncertainty-aware HSI reconstruction. Our results also reiterate the significance of effective spectral encoding in snapshot hyperspectral imaging.

Conclusion: VDC-Agent证明了无需人工标注或大型教师模型即可实现高质量视频描述的可能性，为自动数据生成和模型优化提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We present VDC-Agent, a self-evolving framework for Video Detailed Captioning that requires neither human annotations nor larger teacher models. The agent forms a closed loop of caption generation, principle-guided scoring (score and textual suggestions), and prompt refinement. When caption quality regresses, a self-reflection path leverages the previous chain-of-thought to amend the update. Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the trajectories into preference tuples and filter out samples with JSON parsing errors, resulting in VDC-Agent-19K, which contains 18,886 automatically constructed pairs. We then fine-tune the base MLLM on this dataset using an easy-to-hard curriculum direct preference optimization. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, our VDC-Agent-7B attains state-of-the-art performance on the VDC benchmark with 49.08% average accuracy and 2.50 score, surpassing specialized video captioners and improving over the base model by +5.13% accuracy and +0.27 score at similar inference cost.

Conclusion: 这些技术能够在真实世界边缘设备上高效部署能力强大的视觉语言模型

Abstract: The demand for edge AI in vision-language tasks requires models that achieve real-time performance on resource-constrained devices with limited power and memory. This paper proposes two adaptive compression techniques -- Sparse Temporal Token Fusion (STTF) and Adaptive Neural Compression (ANC) -- that integrate algorithmic innovations with hardware-aware optimizations. Unlike previous approaches relying on static pruning or uniform scaling, STTF dynamically reuses visual tokens through event-driven change detection, while ANC conditionally activates encoder branches via a learned router, enabling fine-grained adaptation to scene complexity. Our 3B-parameter TinyGPT-STTF achieves CIDEr 131.2, BLEU-4 0.38, METEOR 0.31, and ROUGE-L 0.56 on the COCO 2017 test set, surpassing LLaVA-1.5 7B by 17.6 CIDEr points while using 2.3x fewer parameters and 62x fewer on-device FLOPs. TinyGPT-ANC reaches CIDEr 128.5. On event-based vision tasks, STTF reduces average token count by 84% (from 196 to 31 tokens) while preserving 95.6% accuracy on the DVS128 Gesture dataset, and ANC cuts FLOPs by up to 90% in low-motion scenes. Compared to strong baselines, our models improve accuracy by up to 4.4% and reduce latency by up to 13x. These results enable efficient deployment of capable vision-language models on real-world edge devices.

Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have achieved remarkable success and become the mainstream paradigm for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) reconstruction. Existing DUNs are derived from full-HSI imaging models, where each stage operates directly on the high-dimensional HSI, refining the entire data cube based on the single 2D coded measurement. However, this paradigm leads to computational redundancy and suffers from the ill-posed nature of mapping 2D residuals back to 3D space of HSI. In this paper, we propose two novel imaging models corresponding to the spectral basis and subspace image by explicitly integrating low-rank (LR) decomposition with the sensing model. Compared to recovering the full HSI, estimating these compact low-dimensional components significantly mitigates the ill-posedness. Building upon these novel models, we develop the Low-Rank Deep Unfolding Network (LRDUN), which jointly solves the two subproblems within an unfolded proximal gradient descent (PGD) framework. Furthermore, we introduce a Generalized Feature Unfolding Mechanism (GFUM) that decouples the physical rank in the data-fidelity term from the feature dimensionality in the prior module, enhancing the representational capacity and flexibility of the network. Extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed LRDUN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) reconstruction quality with significantly reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Solar energy is one of the most abundant and tapped sources of renewable energies with enormous future potential. Solar panel output can vary widely with factors like intensity, temperature, dirt, debris and so on affecting it. We have implemented a model on detecting dust and fault on solar panels. These two applications are centralized as a single-platform and can be utilized for routine-maintenance and any other checks. These are checked against various parameters such as power output, sinusoidal wave (I-V component of solar cell), voltage across each solar cell and others. Firstly, we filter and preprocess the obtained images using gamma removal and Gaussian filtering methods alongside some predefined processes like normalization. The first application is to detect whether a solar cell is dusty or not based on various pre-determined metrics like shadowing, leaf, droppings, air pollution and from other human activities to extent of fine-granular solar modules. The other one is detecting faults and other such occurrences on solar panels like faults, cracks, cell malfunction using thermal imaging application. This centralized platform can be vital since solar panels have different efficiency across different geography (air and heat affect) and can also be utilized for small-scale house requirements to large-scale solar farm sustentation effectively. It incorporates CNN, ResNet models that with self-attention mechanisms-KerNet model which are used for classification and results in a fine-tuned system that detects dust or any fault occurring. Thus, this multi-application model proves to be efficient and optimized in detecting dust and faults on solar panels. We have performed various comparisons and findings that demonstrates that our model has better efficiency and accuracy results overall than existing models.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了向无训练持续适应的范式转变，为FSCIL提供了高效且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efforts to overcome catastrophic forgetting in Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) have primarily focused on developing more effective gradient-based optimization strategies. In contrast, little attention has been paid to the training cost explosion that inevitably arises as the number of novel classes increases, a consequence of relying on gradient learning even under extreme data scarcity. More critically, since FSCIL typically provides only a few samples for each new class, gradient-based updates not only induce severe catastrophic forgetting on base classes but also hinder adaptation to novel ones. This paper seeks to break this long-standing limitation by asking: Can we design a training-free FSCIL paradigm that entirely removes gradient optimization? We provide an affirmative answer by uncovering an intriguing connection between gradient-based optimization and the Conditional Diffusion process. Building on this observation, we propose a Conditional Diffusion-driven FSCIL (CD-FSCIL) framework that substitutes the conventional gradient update process with a diffusion-based generative transition, enabling training-free incremental adaptation while effectively mitigating forgetting. Furthermore, to enhance representation under few-shot constraints, we introduce a multimodal learning strategy that integrates visual features with natural language descriptions automatically generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). This synergy substantially alleviates the sample scarcity issue and improves generalization across novel classes. Extensive experiments on mainstream FSCIL benchmarks demonstrate that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also drastically reduces computational and memory overhead, marking a paradigm shift toward training-free continual adaptation.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of individual teeth from panoramic radiographs remains a challenging task due to anatomical variations, irregular tooth shapes, and overlapping structures. These complexities often limit the performance of conventional deep learning models. To address this, we propose DE-KAN, a novel Dual Encoder Kolmogorov Arnold Network, which enhances feature representation and segmentation precision. The framework employs a ResNet-18 encoder for augmented inputs and a customized CNN encoder for original inputs, enabling the complementary extraction of global and local spatial features. These features are fused through KAN-based bottleneck layers, incorporating nonlinear learnable activation functions derived from the Kolmogorov Arnold representation theorem to improve learning capacity and interpretability. Extensive experiments on two benchmark dental X-ray datasets demonstrate that DE-KAN outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation models, achieving mIoU of 94.5%, Dice coefficient of 97.1%, accuracy of 98.91%, and recall of 97.36%, representing up to +4.7% improvement in Dice compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity MR images from undersampled k-space data requires recovering high-frequency details while maintaining anatomical coherence. We present HiFi-MambaV2, a hierarchical shared-routed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Mamba architecture that couples frequency decomposition with content-adaptive computation. The model comprises two core components: (i) a separable frequency-consistent Laplacian pyramid (SF-Lap) that delivers alias-resistant, stable low- and high-frequency streams; and (ii) a hierarchical shared-routed MoE that performs per-pixel top-1 sparse dispatch to shared experts and local routers, enabling effective specialization with stable cross-depth behavior. A lightweight global context path is fused into an unrolled, data-consistency-regularized backbone to reinforce long-range reasoning and preserve anatomical coherence. Evaluated on fastMRI, CC359, ACDC, M4Raw, and Prostate158, HiFi-MambaV2 consistently outperforms CNN-, Transformer-, and prior Mamba-based baselines in PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE across single- and multi-coil settings and multiple acceleration factors, consistently surpassing consistent improvements in high-frequency detail and overall structural fidelity. These results demonstrate that HiFi-MambaV2 enables reliable and robust MRI reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了零样本视频去雨，在动态场景中有效去除雨滴同时保持背景一致性，展示了预训练扩散模型的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing video deraining methods are often trained on paired datasets, either synthetic, which limits their ability to generalize to real-world rain, or captured by static cameras, which restricts their effectiveness in dynamic scenes with background and camera motion. Furthermore, recent works in fine-tuning diffusion models have shown promising results, but the fine-tuning tends to weaken the generative prior, limiting generalization to unseen cases. In this paper, we introduce the first zero-shot video deraining method for complex dynamic scenes that does not require synthetic data nor model fine-tuning, by leveraging a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model that demonstrates strong generalization capabilities. By inverting an input video into the latent space of diffusion models, its reconstruction process can be intervened and pushed away from the model's concept of rain using negative prompting. At the core of our approach is an attention switching mechanism that we found is crucial for maintaining dynamic backgrounds as well as structural consistency between the input and the derained video, mitigating artifacts introduced by naive negative prompting. Our approach is validated through extensive experiments on real-world rain datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior methods and showcasing robust generalization without the need for supervised training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有几何模型在处理不同视角（如航拍vs地面）或不同模态（如照片vs抽象绘图）的输入时表现不佳，特别是在地面照片与平面图对应这一挑战性问题上。

Method: 通过从互联网照片集合中重建3D场景，然后手动将重建结果与互联网收集的平面图配准，从而推导出图像与平面图之间的对应关系。

Result: C3数据集包含597个场景中的9万对平面图和照片，1.53亿像素级对应关系和8.5万个相机姿态。在训练新数据后，最佳方法的RMSE提高了34%。

Conclusion: 该数据集有助于解决跨模态几何推理中的开放挑战，现有最先进的对应模型在此任务上表现困难。

Abstract: Geometric models like DUSt3R have shown great advances in understanding the geometry of a scene from pairs of photos. However, they fail when the inputs are from vastly different viewpoints (e.g., aerial vs. ground) or modalities (e.g., photos vs. abstract drawings) compared to what was observed during training. This paper addresses a challenging version of this problem: predicting correspondences between ground-level photos and floor plans. Current datasets for joint photo--floor plan reasoning are limited, either lacking in varying modalities (VIGOR) or lacking in correspondences (WAFFLE). To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset, C3, created by first reconstructing a number of scenes in 3D from Internet photo collections via structure-from-motion, then manually registering the reconstructions to floor plans gathered from the Internet, from which we can derive correspondence between images and floor plans. C3 contains 90K paired floor plans and photos across 597 scenes with 153M pixel-level correspondences and 85K camera poses. We find that state-of-the-art correspondence models struggle on this task. By training on our new data, we can improve on the best performing method by 34% in RMSE. We also identify open challenges in cross-modal geometric reasoning that our dataset aims to help address.

Abstract: Understanding physical properties such as friction, stiffness, hardness, and material composition is essential for enabling robots to interact safely and effectively with their surroundings. However, existing 3D reconstruction methods focus on geometry and appearance and cannot infer these underlying physical properties. We present PhysGS, a Bayesian-inferred extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting that estimates dense, per-point physical properties from visual cues and vision--language priors. We formulate property estimation as Bayesian inference over Gaussian splats, where material and property beliefs are iteratively refined as new observations arrive. PhysGS also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, enabling uncertainty-aware object and scene interpretation. Across object-scale (ABO-500), indoor, and outdoor real-world datasets, PhysGS improves accuracy of the mass estimation by up to 22.8%, reduces Shore hardness error by up to 61.2%, and lowers kinetic friction error by up to 18.1% compared to deterministic baselines. Our results demonstrate that PhysGS unifies 3D reconstruction, uncertainty modeling, and physical reasoning in a single, spatially continuous framework for dense physical property estimation.

Abstract: Real-world dark images commonly exhibit not only low visibility and contrast but also complex noise and blur, posing significant restoration challenges. Existing methods often rely on paired data or fail to model dynamic illumination and blur characteristics, leading to poor generalization. To tackle this, we propose a generative framework based on visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, guided by perceptual priors from the vision-language model (VLM). Specifically, to supply informative conditioning cues for VAR models, we deploy an adaptive curve estimation scheme to modulate the diverse illumination based on VLM-derived visibility scores. In addition, we integrate dynamic and spatial-frequency-aware Rotary Positional Encodings (SF-RoPE) into VAR to enhance its ability to model structures degraded by blur. Furthermore, we propose a recursive phase-domain modulation strategy that mitigates blur-induced artifacts in the phase domain via bounded iterative refinement guided by VLM-assessed blur scores. Our framework is fully unsupervised and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Neural asset authoring and neural rendering have emerged as fundamentally disjoint threads: one generates digital assets using neural networks for traditional graphics pipelines, while the other develops neural renderers that map conventional assets to images. However, the potential of jointly designing the asset representation and renderer remains largely unexplored. We argue that coupling them can unlock an end-to-end learnable graphics stack with benefits in fidelity, consistency, and efficiency. In this paper, we explore this possibility with NeAR: a Coupled Neural Asset-Renderer Stack. On the asset side, we build on Trellis-style Structured 3D Latents and introduce a lighting-homogenized neural asset: from a casually lit input, a rectified-flow backbone predicts a Lighting-Homogenized SLAT that encodes geometry and intrinsic material cues in a compact, view-agnostic latent. On the renderer side, we design a lighting-aware neural renderer that uses this neural asset, along with explicit view embeddings and HDR environment maps, to achieve real-time, relightable rendering. We validate NeAR on four tasks: (1) G-buffer-based forward rendering, (2) random-lit single-image reconstruction, (3) unknown-lit single-image relighting, and (4) novel-view relighting. Our coupled stack surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both quantitative metrics and perceptual quality. We hope this coupled asset-renderer perspective inspires future graphics stacks that view neural assets and renderers as co-designed components instead of independent entities.

Abstract: In this paper, we present RigAnyFace (RAF), a scalable neural auto-rigging framework for facial meshes of diverse topologies, including those with multiple disconnected components. RAF deforms a static neutral facial mesh into industry-standard FACS poses to form an expressive blendshape rig. Deformations are predicted by a triangulation-agnostic surface learning network augmented with our tailored architecture design to condition on FACS parameters and efficiently process disconnected components. For training, we curated a dataset of facial meshes, with a subset meticulously rigged by professional artists to serve as accurate 3D ground truth for deformation supervision. Due to the high cost of manual rigging, this subset is limited in size, constraining the generalization ability of models trained exclusively on it. To address this, we design a 2D supervision strategy for unlabeled neutral meshes without rigs. This strategy increases data diversity and allows for scaled training, thereby enhancing the generalization ability of models trained on this augmented data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAF is able to rig meshes of diverse topologies on not only our artist-crafted assets but also in-the-wild samples, outperforming previous works in accuracy and generalizability. Moreover, our method advances beyond prior work by supporting multiple disconnected components, such as eyeballs, for more detailed expression animation.

Abstract: Reliable detection of retinal diseases from fundus images is challenged by the variability in imaging quality, subtle early-stage manifestations, and domain shift across datasets. In this study, we systematically evaluated a Vision Transformer (ViT) classifier under multiple augmentation and enhancement strategies across several heterogeneous public datasets, as well as the AEyeDB dataset, a high-quality fundus dataset created in-house and made available for the research community. The ViT demonstrated consistently strong performance, with accuracies ranging from 0.789 to 0.843 across datasets and diseases. Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration were detected reliably, whereas glaucoma remained the most frequently misclassified disease. Geometric and color augmentations provided the most stable improvements, while histogram equalization benefited datasets dominated by structural subtlety. Laplacian enhancement reduced performance across different settings.
  On the Papila dataset, the ViT with geometric augmentation achieved an AUC of 0.91, outperforming previously reported convolutional ensemble baselines (AUC of 0.87), underscoring the advantages of transformer architectures and multi-dataset training. To complement the classifier, we developed a GANomaly-based anomaly detector, achieving an AUC of 0.76 while providing inherent reconstruction-based explainability and robust generalization to unseen data. Probabilistic calibration using GUESS enabled threshold-independent decision support for future clinical implementation.

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tumor data presents a major obstacle to accurate and automated tumor segmentation. While existing data synthesis methods offer promising solutions, they often suffer from key limitations: manual modeling is labor intensive and requires expert knowledge. Deep generative models may be used to augment data and annotation, but they typically demand large amounts of training pairs in the first place, which is impractical in data limited clinical settings. In this work, we propose Tumor Fabrication (TF), a novel two-stage framework for unpaired 3D brain tumor synthesis. The framework comprises a coarse tumor synthesis process followed by a refinement process powered by a generative model. TF is fully automated and leverages only healthy image scans along with a limited amount of real annotated data to synthesize large volumes of paired synthetic data for enriching downstream supervised segmentation training. We demonstrate that our synthetic image-label pairs used as data enrichment can significantly improve performance on downstream tumor segmentation tasks in low-data regimes, offering a scalable and reliable solution for medical image enrichment and addressing critical challenges in data scarcity for clinical AI applications.

Conclusion: 提出的超像素正则化方法能够生成对尺度变化具有弹性的对抗补丁，在数字和物理域都表现出更好的性能，解决了插值损失导致的对抗信号退化问题。

Abstract: Physical adversarial attacks on deep learning systems is concerning due to the ease of deploying such attacks, usually by placing an adversarial patch in a scene to manipulate the outcomes of a deep learning model. Training such patches typically requires regularization that improves physical realizability (e.g., printability, smoothness) and/or robustness to real-world variability (e.g. deformations, viewing angle, noise). One type of variability that has received little attention is scale variability. When a patch is rescaled, either digitally through downsampling/upsampling or physically through changing imaging distances, interpolation-induced color mixing occurs. This smooths out pixel values, resulting in a loss of high-frequency patterns and degrading the adversarial signal. To address this, we present a novel superpixel-based regularization method that guides patch optimization to scale-resilient structures. Our ap proach employs the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm to dynamically cluster pixels in an adversarial patch during optimization. The Implicit Function Theorem is used to backpropagate gradients through SLIC to update the superpixel boundaries and color. This produces patches that maintain their structure over scale and are less susceptible to interpolation losses. Our method achieves greater performance in the digital domain, and when realized physically, these performance gains are preserved, leading to improved physical performance. Real-world performance was objectively assessed using a novel physical evaluation protocol that utilizes screens and cardboard cut-outs to systematically vary real-world conditions.

Abstract: Robust lane detection is essential for advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving, yet models trained on public datasets such as CULane often fail to generalise across different camera viewpoints. This paper addresses the challenge of domain shift for side-mounted cameras used in lane-wheel monitoring by introducing a generative AI-based data enhancement pipeline. The approach combines geometric perspective transformation, AI-driven inpainting, and vehicle body overlays to simulate deployment-specific viewpoints while preserving lane continuity. We evaluated the effectiveness of the proposed augmentation in two state-of-the-art models, SCNN and UFLDv2. With the augmented data trained, both models show improved robustness to different conditions, including shadows. The experimental results demonstrate gains in precision, recall, and F1 score compared to the pre-trained model.
  By bridging the gap between widely available datasets and deployment-specific scenarios, our method provides a scalable and practical framework to improve the reliability of lane detection in a pilot deployment scenario.

TL;DR: Sphinx是一个免训练的混合推理框架，通过回归式快速初始化引导扩散模型降噪，结合选择性细化和自适应噪声调度，在保持扩散级质量的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散式新视角合成计算成本过高，而回归式方法质量不足的问题，实现高质量与推理效率的平衡。

Method: 使用回归式快速初始化减少扩散模型的降噪工作量，集成选择性细化和自适应噪声调度，将更多计算资源分配给不确定区域和帧。

Result: 相比扩散模型推理平均加速1.8倍，感知质量退化小于5%，在NVS服务中建立了质量与延迟的新帕累托边界。

Conclusion: Sphinx框架成功实现了扩散级质量与显著降低计算成本的平衡，为动态变化的推理场景提供了灵活的性能-质量权衡方案。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) is the task of generating new images of a scene from viewpoints that were not part of the original input. Diffusion-based NVS can generate high-quality, temporally consistent images, however, remains computationally prohibitive. Conversely, regression-based NVS offers suboptimal generation quality despite requiring significantly lower compute; leaving the design objective of a high-quality, inference-efficient NVS framework an open challenge. To close this critical gap, we present Sphinx, a training-free hybrid inference framework that achieves diffusion-level fidelity at a significantly lower compute. Sphinx proposes to use regression-based fast initialization to guide and reduce the denoising workload for the diffusion model. Additionally, it integrates selective refinement with adaptive noise scheduling, allowing more compute to uncertain regions and frames. This enables Sphinx to provide flexible navigation of the performance-quality trade-off, allowing adaptation to latency and fidelity requirements for dynamically changing inference scenarios. Our evaluation shows that Sphinx achieves an average 1.8x speedup over diffusion model inference with negligible perceptual degradation of less than 5%, establishing a new Pareto frontier between quality and latency in NVS serving.

Conclusion: 编辑导向的扩散变换器在几何感知任务中展现出强大潜力，为密集感知提供了更有效的基础模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have shown remarkable generalization in visual synthesis, yet most dense perception methods still rely on text-to-image (T2I) generators designed for stochastic generation. We revisit this paradigm and show that image editing diffusion models are inherently image-to-image consistent, providing a more suitable foundation for dense perception task. We introduce Edit2Perceive, a unified diffusion framework that adapts editing models for depth, normal, and matting. Built upon the FLUX.1 Kontext architecture, our approach employs full-parameter fine-tuning and a pixel-space consistency loss to enforce structure-preserving refinement across intermediate denoising states. Moreover, our single-step deterministic inference yields up to faster runtime while training on relatively small datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate comprehensive state-of-the-art results across all three tasks, revealing the strong potential of editing-oriented diffusion transformers for geometry-aware perception.

Conclusion: KTCAA框架通过理论指导的跨模态泛化方法，有效解决了素描-图像人员重识别的挑战。

Abstract: Sketch based person re-identification aims to match hand-drawn sketches with RGB surveillance images, but remains challenging due to significant modality gaps and limited annotated data. To address this, we introduce KTCAA, a theoretically grounded framework for few-shot cross-modal generalization. Motivated by generalization theory, we identify two key factors influencing target domain risk: (1) domain discrepancy, which quantifies the alignment difficulty between source and target distributions; and (2) perturbation invariance, which evaluates the model's robustness to modality shifts. Based on these insights, we propose two components: (1) Alignment Augmentation (AA), which applies localized sketch-style transformations to simulate target distributions and facilitate progressive alignment; and (2) Knowledge Transfer Catalyst (KTC), which enhances invariance by introducing worst-case perturbations and enforcing consistency. These modules are jointly optimized under a meta-learning paradigm that transfers alignment knowledge from data-rich RGB domains to sketch-based scenarios. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KTCAA achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in data-scarce conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了解码器无关、存储高效的神经几何图像表示，能够通过单次前向传递恢复高质量网格，解决了现有方法的计算效率问题。

Abstract: Neural representations for 3D meshes are emerging as an effective solution for compact storage and efficient processing. Existing methods often rely on neural overfitting, where a coarse mesh is stored and progressively refined through multiple decoder networks. While this can restore high-quality surfaces, it is computationally expensive due to successive decoding passes and the irregular structure of mesh data. In contrast, images have a regular structure that enables powerful super-resolution and restoration frameworks, but applying these advantages to meshes is difficult because their irregular connectivity demands complex encoder-decoder architectures. Our key insight is that a geometry image-based representation transforms irregular meshes into a regular image grid, making efficient image-based neural processing directly applicable. Building on this idea, we introduce our neural geometry image-based representation, which is decoder-free, storage-efficient, and naturally suited for neural processing. It stores a low-resolution geometry-image mipmap of the surface, from which high-quality meshes are restored in a single forward pass. To construct geometry images, we leverage Optimal Transport (OT), which resolves oversampling in flat regions and undersampling in feature-rich regions, and enables continuous levels of detail (LoD) through geometry-image mipmapping. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art storage efficiency and restoration accuracy, measured by compression ratio (CR), Chamfer distance (CD), and Hausdorff distance (HD).

Conclusion: 该相位展开框架通过结合微分同胚和GraphCut方法，成功解决了速度与精度之间的权衡问题，为实时3D扫描应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed rapid advancements in 3D scanning technologies, with applications spanning VR/AR, digital human creation, and medical imaging. Structured-light scanning with phase-shifting techniques is preferred for its use of low-intensity visible light and high accuracy, making it well suited for capturing 4D facial dynamics. A key step is phase unwrapping, which recovers continuous phase values from measurements wrapped modulo 2pi. The goal is to estimate the unwrapped phase count k in the equation Phi = phi + 2pi k, where phi is the wrapped phase and Phi is the true phase. Noise, occlusions, and complex 3D geometry make recovering the true phase challenging because phase unwrapping is ill-posed: measurements only provide modulo 2pi values, and estimating k requires assumptions about surface continuity. Existing methods trade speed for accuracy: fast approaches lack precision, while accurate algorithms are too slow for real-time use. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a phase unwrapping framework that reformulates GraphCut-based unwrapping as a pixel-labeling problem. This framework improves the estimation of the unwrapped phase count k through the invariance property of diffeomorphisms applied in image space via conformal and optimal transport (OT) maps. An odd number of diffeomorphisms are precomputed from the input phase data, and a hierarchical GraphCut algorithm is applied in each domain. The resulting label maps are fused via majority voting to robustly estimate k at each pixel. Experimental results demonstrate a 45.5x speedup and lower L2 error in real experiments and simulations, showing potential for real-time applications.

TL;DR: ICE是一种无需训练、模态无关的一次性权重修改方法，通过各向异性能量加权缩放定义擦除和保留子空间，并使用独特的闭式重叠投影器显式正则化它们的交集，实现精确、持久的遗忘。

Conclusion: ICE是一种训练免费、模态无关、一次性权重修改方法，能够实现精确持久的遗忘，且无运行时开销，在多种概念移除任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Robust concept removal for text-to-image (T2I) and text-to-video (T2V) models is essential for their safe deployment. Existing methods, however, suffer from costly retraining, inference overhead, or vulnerability to adversarial attacks. Crucially, they rarely model the latent semantic overlap between the target erase concept and surrounding content -- causing collateral damage post-erasure -- and even fewer methods work reliably across both T2I and T2V domains. We introduce Instant Concept Erasure (ICE), a training-free, modality-agnostic, one-shot weight modification approach that achieves precise, persistent unlearning with zero overhead. ICE defines erase and preserve subspaces using anisotropic energy-weighted scaling, then explicitly regularises against their intersection using a unique, closed-form overlap projector. We pose a convex and Lipschitz-bounded Spectral Unlearning Objective, balancing erasure fidelity and intersection preservation, that admits a stable and unique analytical solution. This solution defines a dissociation operator that is translated to the model's text-conditioning layers, making the edit permanent and runtime-free. Across targeted removals of artistic styles, objects, identities, and explicit content, ICE efficiently achieves strong erasure with improved robustness to red-teaming, all while causing only minimal degradation of original generative abilities in both T2I and T2V models.

Result: 主流多模态大语言模型在生成物理交互的详细指令方面表现不佳，在意图和评估等高阶推理方面存在显著局限，但使用CFG-Bench数据进行监督微调能显著提升在现有具身基准上的性能。

Conclusion: CFG-Bench揭示了多模态大语言模型在物理交互推理方面的局限性，为开发更强大和接地气的具身智能体提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promising results as decision-making engines for embodied agents operating in complex, physical environments. However, existing benchmarks often prioritize high-level planning or spatial reasoning, leaving the fine-grained action intelligence required for embodied physical interaction underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce CFG-Bench, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate this crucial capability. CFG-Bench consists of 1,368 curated videos paired with 19,562 three-modalities question-answer pairs targeting four cognitive abilities: 1) Physical Interaction, 2) Temporal-Causal Relation, 3) Intentional Understanding, and 4) Evaluative Judgment. Together, these dimensions provide a systematic framework for assessing a model's ability to translate visual observations into actionable knowledge, moving beyond mere surface-level recognition. Our comprehensive evaluation on CFG-Bench reveals that leading MLLMs struggle to produce detailed instructions for physical interactions and exhibit profound limitations in the higher-order reasoning of intention and evaluation. Moreover, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our data demonstrates that teaching an MLLMs to articulate fine-grained actions directly translates to significant performance gains on established embodied benchmarks. Our analysis highlights these limitations and offers insights for developing more capable and grounded embodied agents.

Abstract: In this work, we explore the technical feasibility of implementing end-to-end 3D object detection (3DOD) with surround-view fisheye camera system. Specifically, we first investigate the performance drop incurred when transferring classic pinhole-based 3D object detectors to fisheye imagery. To mitigate this, we then develop two methods that incorporate the unique geometry of fisheye images into mainstream detection frameworks: one based on the bird's-eye-view (BEV) paradigm, named FisheyeBEVDet, and the other on the query-based paradigm, named FisheyePETR. Both methods adopt spherical spatial representations to effectively capture fisheye geometry. In light of the lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks, we release Fisheye3DOD, a new open dataset synthesized using CARLA and featuring both standard pinhole and fisheye camera arrays. Experiments on Fisheye3DOD show that our fisheye-compatible modeling improves accuracy by up to 6.2% over baseline methods.

Conclusion: 该卷积的计算方式与生物神经元树突的一致性使其在复杂噪声环境中表现显著优于传统卷积，为从神经元角度解决噪声干扰问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios of image recognition, there exists substantial noise interference. Existing works primarily focus on methods such as adjusting networks or training strategies to address noisy image recognition, and the anti-noise performance has reached a bottleneck. However, little is known about the exploration of anti-interference solutions from a neuronal perspective.This paper proposes an anti-noise neuronal convolution. This convolution mimics the dendritic structure of neurons, integrates the neighborhood interaction computation logic of dendrites into the underlying design of convolutional operations, and simulates the XOR logic preprocessing function of biological dendrites through nonlinear interactions between input features, thereby fundamentally reconstructing the mathematical paradigm of feature extraction. Unlike traditional convolution where noise directly interferes with feature extraction and exerts a significant impact, DDC mitigates the influence of noise by focusing on the interaction of neighborhood information. Experimental results demonstrate that in image classification tasks (using YOLOv11-cls, VGG16, and EfficientNet-B0) and object detection tasks (using YOLOv11, YOLOv8, and YOLOv5), after replacing traditional convolution with the dendritic convolution, the accuracy of the EfficientNet-B0 model on noisy datasets is relatively improved by 11.23%, and the mean Average Precision (mAP) of YOLOv8 is increased by 19.80%. The consistency between the computation method of this convolution and the dendrites of biological neurons enables it to perform significantly better than traditional convolution in complex noisy environments.

Abstract: Existing diffusion codecs typically build on text-to-image diffusion foundation models like Stable Diffusion. However, text conditioning is suboptimal from a compression perspective, hindering the potential of downstream diffusion codecs, particularly at ultra-low bitrates. To address it, we introduce \textbf{CoD}, the first \textbf{Co}mpression-oriented \textbf{D}iffusion foundation model, trained from scratch to enable end-to-end optimization of both compression and generation. CoD is not a fixed codec but a general foundation model designed for various diffusion-based codecs. It offers several advantages: \textbf{High compression efficiency}, replacing Stable Diffusion with CoD in downstream codecs like DiffC achieves SOTA results, especially at ultra-low bitrates (e.g., 0.0039 bpp); \textbf{Low-cost and reproducible training}, 300$\times$ faster training than Stable Diffusion ($\sim$ 20 vs. $\sim$ 6,250 A100 GPU days) on entirely open image-only datasets; \textbf{Providing new insights}, e.g., We find pixel-space diffusion can achieve VTM-level PSNR with high perceptual quality and can outperform GAN-based codecs using fewer parameters. We hope CoD lays the foundation for future diffusion codec research. Codes will be released.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D object detection recognizes and localizes 3D objects from RGB images. However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.

However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on a single scalar reward per sample, treating each image or video as a holistic entity and ignoring the rich spatial and temporal structure of visual content. This coarse supervision hinders the correction of localized artifacts and the modeling of fine-grained perceptual cues. We introduce Visual Preference Policy Optimization (ViPO), a GRPO variant that lifts scalar feedback into structured, pixel-level advantages. ViPO employs a Perceptual Structuring Module that uses pretrained vision backbones to construct spatially and temporally aware advantage maps, redistributing optimization pressure toward perceptually important regions while preserving the stability of standard GRPO. Across both image and video benchmarks, ViPO consistently outperforms vanilla GRPO, improving in-domain alignment with human-preference rewards and enhancing generalization on out-of-domain evaluations. The method is architecture-agnostic, lightweight, and fully compatible with existing GRPO training pipelines, providing a more expressive and informative learning signal for visual generation.

Conclusion: GuideFlow通过约束流匹配成功解决了多模态轨迹崩溃和约束整合问题，实现了高性能的自动驾驶规划，代码将开源发布。

Abstract: Driving planning is a critical component of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving. However, prevailing Imitative E2E Planners often suffer from multimodal trajectory mode collapse, failing to produce diverse trajectory proposals. Meanwhile, Generative E2E Planners struggle to incorporate crucial safety and physical constraints directly into the generative process, necessitating an additional optimization stage to refine their outputs. In this paper, we propose \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}, a novel planning framework that leverages Constrained Flow Matching. Concretely, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} explicitly models the flow matching process, which inherently mitigates mode collapse and allows for flexible guidance from various conditioning signals. Our core contribution lies in directly enforcing explicit constraints within the flow matching generation process, rather than relying on implicit constraint encoding. Crucially, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} unifies the training of the flow matching with the Energy-Based Model (EBM) to enhance the model's autonomous optimization capability to robustly satisfy physical constraints. Secondly, \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} parameterizes driving aggressiveness as a control signal during generation, enabling precise manipulation of trajectory style. Extensive evaluations on major driving benchmarks (Bench2Drive, NuScenes, NavSim and ADV-NuScenes) validate the effectiveness of \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}}. Notably, on the NavSim test hard split (Navhard), \textit{\textbf{GuideFlow}} achieved SOTA with an EPDMS score of 43.0. The code will be released.

TL;DR: RefPtsFusion是一种轻量级可解释的协同自动驾驶框架，通过交换紧凑的参考点（如物体位置、速度、尺寸信息）而非大型特征图，将通信带宽从数百MB/s降至几KB/s，同时保持稳定的感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统协同自动驾驶中特征图共享带来的高通信带宽需求问题，创建传感器和模型无关的接口，支持异构感知模型的车辆间协作。

Method: 使用参考点交换机制，将关注点从"看到什么"转向"看哪里"，并开发选择性Top-K查询融合，选择性添加发送方的高置信度查询。

Result: 在M3CAD数据集上，通信开销降低五个数量级（从数百MB/s降至几KB/s），同时保持稳定的感知性能，展现出强大的鲁棒性和一致的传输行为。

Conclusion: RefPtsFusion为实现可扩展、实时的协同驾驶系统提供了有前景的解决方案，在通信效率和感知准确性之间实现了良好平衡。

Abstract: We present RefPtsFusion, a lightweight and interpretable framework for cooperative autonomous driving. Instead of sharing large feature maps or query embeddings, vehicles exchange compact reference points, e.g., objects' positions, velocities, and size information. This approach shifts the focus from "what is seen" to "where to see", creating a sensor- and model-independent interface that works well across vehicles with heterogeneous perception models while greatly reducing communication bandwidth. To enhance the richness of shared information, we further develop a selective Top-K query fusion that selectively adds high-confidence queries from the sender. It thus achieves a strong balance between accuracy and communication cost. Experiments on the M3CAD dataset show that RefPtsFusion maintains stable perception performance while reducing communication overhead by five orders of magnitude, dropping from hundreds of MB/s to only a few KB/s at 5 FPS (frame per second), compared to traditional feature-level fusion methods. Extensive experiments also demonstrate RefPtsFusion's strong robustness and consistent transmission behavior, highlighting its potential for scalable, real-time cooperative driving systems.

Conclusion: VAOT框架在无配对设置下有效减少噪声同时保持血管结构，在眼底图像增强方面表现出优越性。

Abstract: Color fundus photography (CFP) is central to diagnosing and monitoring retinal disease, yet its acquisition variability (e.g., illumination changes) often degrades image quality, which motivates robust enhancement methods. Unpaired enhancement pipelines are typically GAN-based, however, they can distort clinically critical vasculature, altering vessel topology and endpoint integrity. Motivated by these structural alterations, we propose Vessel-Aware Optimal Transport (\textbf{VAOT}), a framework that combines an optimal-transport objective with two structure-preserving regularizers: (i) a skeleton-based loss to maintain global vascular connectivity and (ii) an endpoint-aware loss to stabilize local termini. These constraints guide learning in the unpaired setting, reducing noise while preserving vessel structure. Experimental results on synthetic degradation benchmark and downstream evaluations in vessel and lesion segmentation demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods against several state-of-the art baselines.

Motivation: 现有工业3D服装网格几何覆盖广泛但纹理多样性有限，传统方法需要严格拓扑一致性或准确网格变形，限制了纹理生成质量和灵活性。

Result: 前馈双分支架构生成多样化且空间对齐的PBR材质，适用于工业级3D服装设计。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了非等距图像到3D服装纹理生成的挑战，提供了生产就绪的PBR纹理解决方案。

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

Conclusion: 结合运动感知重建和锚帧引导的视频扩散模型能够实现高质量的视频超分辨率。

Abstract: We present STCDiT, a video super-resolution framework built upon a pre-trained video diffusion model, aiming to restore structurally faithful and temporally stable videos from degraded inputs, even under complex camera motions. The main challenges lie in maintaining temporal stability during reconstruction and preserving structural fidelity during generation. To address these challenges, we first develop a motion-aware VAE reconstruction method that performs segment-wise reconstruction, with each segment clip exhibiting uniform motion characteristic, thereby effectively handling videos with complex camera motions. Moreover, we observe that the first-frame latent extracted by the VAE encoder in each clip, termed the anchor-frame latent, remains unaffected by temporal compression and retains richer spatial structural information than subsequent frame latents. We further develop an anchor-frame guidance approach that leverages structural information from anchor frames to constrain the generation process and improve structural fidelity of video features. Coupling these two designs enables the video diffusion model to achieve high-quality video super-resolution. Extensive experiments show that STCDiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of structural fidelity and temporal consistency.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态基准测试中表现良好，但在深度估计、物体计数等视觉感知任务上落后于人类和专用模型。针对单一任务的微调可能对其他任务产生不可预测的影响，这使得任务特定微调具有挑战性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well on multimodal benchmarks but lag behind humans and specialized models on visual perception tasks like depth estimation or object counting. Finetuning on one task can unpredictably affect performance on others, making task-specific finetuning challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge through a systematic study of task transferability. We examine how finetuning a VLM on one perception task affects its zero-shot performance on others. To quantify these effects, we introduce Perfection Gap Factor (PGF), a metric that captures both the breadth and magnitude of transfer. Using three open-weight VLMs evaluated across 13 perception tasks, we construct a task-transfer graph that reveals previously unobserved relationships among perception tasks. Our analysis uncovers patterns of positive and negative transfer, identifies groups of tasks that mutually influence each other, organizes tasks into personas based on their transfer behavior and demonstrates how PGF can guide data selection for more efficient training. These findings highlight both opportunities for positive transfer and risks of negative interference, offering actionable guidance for advancing VLMs.

Abstract: Compared to monocular 3D object detection, stereo-based 3D methods offer significantly higher accuracy but still suffer from high computational overhead and latency. The state-of-the-art stereo 3D detection method achieves twice the accuracy of monocular approaches, yet its inference speed is only half as fast. In this paper, we propose StereoDETR, an efficient stereo 3D object detection framework based on DETR. StereoDETR consists of two branches: a monocular DETR branch and a stereo branch. The DETR branch is built upon 2D DETR with additional channels for predicting object scale, orientation, and sampling points. The stereo branch leverages low-cost multi-scale disparity features to predict object-level depth maps. These two branches are coupled solely through a differentiable depth sampling strategy. To handle occlusion, we introduce a constrained supervision strategy for sampling points without requiring extra annotations. StereoDETR achieves real-time inference and is the first stereo-based method to surpass monocular approaches in speed. It also achieves competitive accuracy on the public KITTI benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art results on pedestrian and cyclist subsets.

TL;DR: 该论文通过大规模MAE预训练方法，在14个Wi-Fi CSI数据集上验证了数据规模和多样性对跨域泛化性能的关键作用，发现数据而非模型容量是当前Wi-Fi感知泛化的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wi-Fi感知虽然提供了隐私保护的替代方案，但存在严重的跨域泛化问题，模型在不同环境、硬件和用户间表现不佳，现有数据集规模有限且分散。

Method: 采用基础模型方法，使用掩码自编码(MAE)风格预训练，在14个数据集、4种设备、2.4/5/6 GHz频段、20-160 MHz带宽的130万样本上进行大规模预训练和评估。

Result: 实验显示：1) 预训练数据量增加带来对数线性性能提升；2) 当前数据量下，更大模型仅带来边际增益；3) 大规模预训练在人类活动识别等任务上比监督学习基线提升2.2%-15.7%的跨域准确率。

Conclusion: 数据规模和多样性是Wi-Fi感知泛化的关键，为设计具有实际部署鲁棒性的未来Wi-Fi感知系统提供了重要方向。

Abstract: While Wi-Fi sensing offers a compelling, privacy-preserving alternative to cameras, its practical utility has been fundamentally undermined by a lack of robustness across domains. Models trained in one setup fail to generalize to new environments, hardware, or users, a critical "domain shift" problem exacerbated by modest, fragmented public datasets. We shift from this limited paradigm and apply a foundation model approach, leveraging Masked Autoencoding (MAE) style pretraining on the largest and most heterogeneous Wi-Fi CSI datasets collection assembled to date. Our study pretrains and evaluates models on over 1.3 million samples extracted from 14 datasets, collected using 4 distinct devices across the 2.4/5/6 GHz bands and bandwidths from 20 to 160 MHz. Our large-scale evaluation is the first to systematically disentangle the impacts of data diversity versus model capacity on cross-domain performance. The results establish scaling trends on Wi-Fi CSI sensing. First, our experiments show log-linear improvements in unseen domain performance as the amount of pretraining data increases, suggesting that data scale and diversity are key to domain generalization. Second, based on the current data volume, larger model can only provide marginal gains for cross-domain performance, indicating that data, rather than model capacity, is the current bottleneck for Wi-Fi sensing generalization. Finally, we conduct a series of cross-domain evaluations on human activity recognition, human gesture recognition and user identification tasks. The results show that the large-scale pretraining improves cross-domain accuracy ranging from 2.2% to 15.7%, compared to the supervised learning baseline. Overall, our findings provide insightful direction for designing future Wi-Fi sensing systems that can eventually be robust enough for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Existing autoregressive (AR) methods for generating artist-designed meshes struggle to balance global structural consistency with high-fidelity local details, and are susceptible to error accumulation. To address this, we propose PartDiffuser, a novel semi-autoregressive diffusion framework for point-cloud-to-mesh generation. The method first performs semantic segmentation on the mesh and then operates in a "part-wise" manner: it employs autoregression between parts to ensure global topology, while utilizing a parallel discrete diffusion process within each semantic part to precisely reconstruct high-frequency geometric features. PartDiffuser is based on the DiT architecture and introduces a part-aware cross-attention mechanism, using point clouds as hierarchical geometric conditioning to dynamically control the generation process, thereby effectively decoupling the global and local generation tasks. Experiments demonstrate that this method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in generating 3D meshes with rich detail, exhibiting exceptional detail representation suitable for real-world applications.

Conclusion: 所提出的目标先验增强隐式学习框架在稀疏视图CT重建中显著提升了学习效率和重建质量，验证了目标先验在隐式3D重建中的重要性。

Abstract: X-ray imaging, based on penetration, enables detailed visualization of internal structures. Building on this capability, existing implicit 3D reconstruction methods have adapted the NeRF model and its variants for internal CT reconstruction. However, these approaches often neglect the significance of objects' anatomical priors for implicit learning, limiting both reconstruction precision and learning efficiency, particularly in ultra-sparse view scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D CT reconstruction framework that employs a 'target prior' derived from the object's projection data to enhance implicit learning. Our approach integrates positional and structural encoding to facilitate voxel-wise implicit reconstruction, utilizing the target prior to guide voxel sampling and enrich structural encoding. This dual strategy significantly boosts both learning efficiency and reconstruction quality. Additionally, we introduce a CUDA-based algorithm for rapid estimation of high-quality 3D target priors from sparse-view projections. Experiments utilizing projection data from a complex abdominal dataset demonstrate that the proposed model substantially enhances learning efficiency, outperforming the current leading model, NAF, by a factor of ten. In terms of reconstruction quality, it also exceeds the most accurate model, NeRP, achieving PSNR improvements of 3.57 dB, 5.42 dB, and 5.70 dB with 10, 20, and 30 projections, respectively.

Abstract: Reliable 4D object detection, which refers to 3D object detection in streaming video, is crucial for perceiving and understanding the real world. Existing open-set 4D object detection methods typically make predictions on a frame-by-frame basis without modeling temporal consistency, or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines that are prone to error propagation across cascaded stages. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions. Building on DA4D, we propose DetAny4D, an open-set end-to-end framework that predicts 3D b-boxes directly from sequential inputs. DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths. Extensive experiments show that DetAny4D achieves competitive detection accuracy and significantly improves temporal stability, effectively addressing long-standing issues of jitter and inconsistency in 4D object detection. Data and code will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: SupLID是一个新颖的语义分割OOD检测框架，通过利用语义空间的几何结构（特别是线性固有维度LID）来指导分类器衍生的OOD分数，解决了现有方法在像素级应用中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于分类器置信度的像素级OOD检测方法存在过度自信等局限性，需要利用语义空间的几何结构来提供补充信号，提高OOD检测能力。

Method: SupLID构建几何核心集捕捉ID子空间的内在结构，在超像素级别计算OOD分数，实现高效实时推理和改善空间平滑性。

Conclusion: SupLID作为一种后处理评分方法，可以无缝集成到任何语义分割分类器中，通过几何线索增强模型检测多样化OOD场景的能力。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation aims to localize anomalous regions at the pixel level, advancing beyond traditional image-level OOD techniques to better suit real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Recent literature has successfully explored the adaptation of commonly used image-level OOD methods--primarily based on classifier-derived confidence scores (e.g., energy or entropy)--for this pixel-precise task. However, these methods inherit a set of limitations, including vulnerability to overconfidence. In this work, we introduce SupLID, a novel framework that effectively guides classifier-derived OOD scores by exploiting the geometrical structure of the underlying semantic space, particularly using Linear Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID). While LID effectively characterizes the local structure of high-dimensional data by analyzing distance distributions, its direct application at the pixel level remains challenging. To overcome this, SupLID constructs a geometrical coreset that captures the intrinsic structure of the in-distribution (ID) subspace. It then computes OOD scores at the superpixel level, enabling both efficient real-time inference and improved spatial smoothness. We demonstrate that geometrical cues derived from SupLID serve as a complementary signal to traditional classifier confidence, enhancing the model's ability to detect diverse OOD scenarios. Designed as a post-hoc scoring method, SupLID can be seamlessly integrated with any semantic segmentation classifier at deployment time. Our results demonstrate that SupLID significantly enhances existing classifier-based OOD scores, achieving state-of-the-art performance across key evaluation metrics, including AUR, FPR, and AUP.

Motivation: 3D多模态大语言模型落后于2D模型，主要因为缺乏大规模高质量的3D场景对话数据集，且现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注并存在视角模糊和对象指代模糊问题

Method: 四阶段全自动管道：元标注收集、场景图构建与关系校正、判别性对象指代、多任务数据生成，结合基于规则的约束与2D MLLMs和LLMs

Conclusion: 该自动化管道能以低成本生成高质量3D对话数据，有效解决数据集中的固有问题，显著提升3D MLLMs性能

Abstract: 3D Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still lag behind their 2D peers, largely because large-scale, high-quality 3D scene-dialogue datasets remain scarce. Prior efforts hinge on expensive human annotation and leave two key ambiguities unresolved: viewpoint ambiguity, where spatial language presumes unknown camera poses, and object referring ambiguity, where non-exclusive descriptions blur the line between targets and distractors. We therefore present a fully automated pipeline that converts raw 3D scans into unambiguous, high-quality dialogue data at a fraction of the previous cost. By synergizing rule-based constraints with 2D MLLMs and LLMs, the pipeline enables controllable, scalable generation without human intervention. The pipeline comprises four stages: (1) meta-annotation collection harvesting object-, frame-, and scene-level captions, (2) scene graph construction with relation correction to capture proximal object relations, (3) discriminative object referring that generates exclusive and compact descriptions, and (4) multi-task data generation synthesizing diverse dialogues. Our pipeline systematically mitigates inherent flaws in source datasets and produces the final Disc3D dataset, over 2 million samples in 25K hybrid 3D scenes, spanning scene, view, and object captioning, visual grounding, and five object-centric QA tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that training with Disc3D yields consistent, significant improvements on both public benchmarks and our multifaceted Disc3D-QA tasks. Code, data, and models will be publicly available.

TL;DR: DiP是一个高效的像素空间扩散框架，通过全局和局部两阶段生成，在保持计算效率的同时实现高质量图像合成，无需依赖VAE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在生成质量和计算效率之间的权衡问题，避免潜在扩散模型的信息损失和非端到端训练问题，同时克服现有像素空间模型在高分辨率合成中的计算瓶颈。

Method: 将生成过程解耦为全局和局部两个阶段：使用扩散变换器（DiT）在大块上构建全局结构，同时使用轻量级补丁细节器头部恢复细粒度局部细节。

Result: 推理速度比先前方法快10倍，参数仅增加0.3%，在ImageNet 256×256上达到1.90 FID分数。

Conclusion: DiP框架在像素空间中实现了与潜在扩散模型相当的计算效率，同时避免了VAE的使用，为高质量图像合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models face a fundamental trade-off between generation quality and computational efficiency. Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) offer an efficient solution but suffer from potential information loss and non-end-to-end training. In contrast, existing pixel space models bypass VAEs but are computationally prohibitive for high-resolution synthesis. To resolve this dilemma, we propose DiP, an efficient pixel space diffusion framework. DiP decouples generation into a global and a local stage: a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone operates on large patches for efficient global structure construction, while a co-trained lightweight Patch Detailer Head leverages contextual features to restore fine-grained local details. This synergistic design achieves computational efficiency comparable to LDMs without relying on a VAE. DiP is accomplished with up to 10$\times$ faster inference speeds than previous method while increasing the total number of parameters by only 0.3%, and achieves an 1.90 FID score on ImageNet 256$\times$256.

TL;DR: VideoPerceiver是一个新颖的视频多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段训练框架提升视频理解中的细粒度感知能力，特别是在短片段中的瞬时动作和长视频中的罕见事件识别方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频多模态大语言模型在细粒度视频理解上的局限性，特别是对短片段中瞬时动作和长视频中罕见瞬态事件的推理能力不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：1) 监督微调阶段，通过构建'关键信息缺失'视频，使用辅助对比损失对齐中间视觉表示与关键词；2) 强化学习阶段，使用相对奖励机制确保完整视频的响应优于降级输入，训练模型恢复时间精确的动作细节。

Result: 实验表明VideoPerceiver在细粒度动作理解和罕见事件描述基准上显著优于最先进的VMLLMs，同时在标准任务上保持强大性能。

Conclusion: 通过优先处理任务相关的视觉特征，这项工作重新定义了视频语言模型的细粒度感知训练方法。

Abstract: We propose VideoPerceiver, a novel video multimodal large language model (VMLLM) that enhances fine-grained perception in video understanding, addressing VMLLMs' limited ability to reason about brief actions in short clips or rare transient events in long videos. VideoPerceiver adopts a two-stage training framework. During supervised fine-tuning (SFT), we construct "key-information-missing" videos by extracting event-action keywords from captions, identifying corresponding key frames, and replacing them with adjacent frames. We jointly encode original and modified video tokens with text tokens, aligning intermediate visual representations with keywords via an auxiliary contrastive loss to enhance sensitivity to fine-grained motion cues. In reinforcement learning (RL), both video variants are fed into the model to generate descriptions, and a novel relative reward ensures responses from complete videos outperform those from degraded inputs, explicitly training the model to recover temporally precise action details. We also curate a dataset of 80,000 videos with fine-grained actions and transient events. Experiments show VideoPerceiver substantially outperforms state-of-the-art VMLLMs on fine-grained action understanding and rare event captioning benchmarks, while maintaining strong performance on standard tasks. By prioritizing task-relevant visual features, our work redefines video-language model training for fine-grained perception.

Motivation: 当前缺乏能够同时进行准确质量评估和提供可解释理由的AI生成视频评估方法，需要建立全面的评估基准。

Method: 采用SlowFast框架区分快慢帧处理，使用多阶段训练策略：先进行监督微调，然后使用分组相对策略优化增强，最后再次微调以提高稳定性。

Result: 模型在视频质量预测方面达到最先进性能，同时提供与人类对齐的可解释理由。

Conclusion: Q-Save为生成视频研究中的可解释评估建立了坚实基础，有助于多模态生成和可信AI的发展。

Abstract: We present Q-Save, a new benchmark dataset and model for holistic and explainable evaluation of AI-generated video (AIGV) quality. The dataset contains near 10000 videos, each annotated with a scalar mean opinion score (MOS) and fine-grained attribution labels along three core dimensions: visual quality, dynamic quality, and text-video alignment. These multi-aspect annotations enable both accurate quality assessment and interpretable reasoning behind the scores. To leverage this data, we propose a unified evaluation model that jointly performs quality scoring and attribution-based explanation. The model adopts the SlowFast framework to distinguish between fast frames and slow frames - slow frames are processed with high resolution while fast frames use low resolution, balancing evaluation accuracy and computational efficiency. For training, we use data formatted in Chain-of-Thought (COT) style and employ a multi-stage strategy: we first conduct Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), then further enhance the model with Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and finally perform SFT again to improve model stability. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in video quality prediction while also providing human-aligned, interpretable justifications. Our dataset and model establish a strong foundation for explainable evaluation in generative video research, contributing to the development of multimodal generation and trustworthy AI. Code and dataset will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for model compression, enabling the transfer of knowledge from large teacher networks to compact student models. However, traditional knowledge distillation methods treat all teacher predictions equally, regardless of the teacher's confidence in those predictions. This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware dual-student knowledge distillation framework that leverages teacher prediction uncertainty to selectively guide student learning. We introduce a peer-learning mechanism where two heterogeneous student architectures, specifically ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2, learn collaboratively from both the teacher network and each other. Experimental results on ImageNet-100 demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to baseline knowledge distillation methods, with ResNet-18 achieving 83.84\% top-1 accuracy and MobileNetV2 achieving 81.46\% top-1 accuracy, representing improvements of 2.04\% and 0.92\% respectively over traditional single-student distillation approaches.

Abstract: Despite being among the most common psychological disorders, anxiety-related conditions are still primarily identified through subjective assessments, such as clinical interviews and self-evaluation questionnaires. These conventional methods often require significant time and may vary depending on the evaluator. However, the emergence of advanced artificial intelligence techniques has created new opportunities for detecting anxiety in a more consistent and automated manner. To address the limitations of traditional approaches, this study introduces a comprehensive model that integrates deep learning architectures with optimization strategies inspired by swarm intelligence. Using multimodal and wearable-sensor datasets, the framework analyzes physiological, emotional, and behavioral signals. Swarm intelligence techniques including genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization are incorporated to refine the feature space and optimize hyperparameters. Meanwhile, deep learning components are tasked with deriving layered and discriminative representations from sequential, multi-source inputs. Our evaluation shows that the fusion of these two computational paradigms significantly enhances detection performance compared with using deep networks alone. The hybrid model achieves notable improvements in accuracy and demonstrates stronger generalization across various individuals. Overall, the results highlight the potential of combining metaheuristic optimization with deep learning to develop scalable, objective, and clinically meaningful solutions for assessing anxiety disorders

Motivation: 视频理解模型的可扩展性受到大规模视频数据集存储和计算成本的限制，现有数据合成方法难以扩展到视频领域，主要挑战在于时间冗余和复杂的时空动态。

Method: 提出VideoCompressa框架，包含可微分关键帧选择器（轻量级ConvNet + Gumbel-Softmax采样）和预训练冻结的VAE，联合优化关键帧选择和潜在代码压缩，最大化任务相关信息保留。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上仅使用0.13%原始数据就超越全数据训练2.34个百分点，速度提升5800倍；在HMDB51上仅用0.41%训练数据就能匹配全数据性能，比零样本基线提升10.61%。

Conclusion: VideoCompressa通过识别和压缩视频帧级冗余，实现了前所未有的视频数据效率，为大规模视频理解模型提供了可行的数据合成解决方案。

Abstract: The scalability of video understanding models is increasingly limited by the prohibitive storage and computational costs of large-scale video datasets. While data synthesis has improved data efficiency in the image domain, its extension to video remains challenging due to pervasive temporal redundancy and complex spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we uncover a critical insight: the primary source of inefficiency in video datasets is not inter-sample redundancy, but intra-sample frame-level redundancy. To leverage this insight, we introduce VideoCompressa, a novel framework for video data synthesis that reframes the problem as dynamic latent compression. Specifically, VideoCompressa jointly optimizes a differentiable keyframe selector-implemented as a lightweight ConvNet with Gumbel-Softmax sampling-to identify the most informative frames, and a pretrained, frozen Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress these frames into compact, semantically rich latent codes. These latent representations are then fed into a compression network, enabling end-to-end backpropagation. Crucially, the keyframe selector and synthetic latent codes are co-optimized to maximize retention of task-relevant information. Experiments show that our method achieves unprecedented data efficiency: on UCF101 with ConvNets, VideoCompressa surpasses full-data training by 2.34\% points using only 0.13\% of the original data, with over 5800x speedup compared to traditional synthesis method. Moreover, when fine-tuning Qwen2.5-7B-VL on HMDB51, VideoCompressa matches full-data performance using just 0.41\% of the training data-outperforming zero-shot baseline by 10.61\%.

Motivation: 传统视觉自回归模型使用均匀尺度下采样构建多尺度金字塔，导致混叠伪影，损害细节并引入锯齿和摩尔纹。

Conclusion: FVAR通过模拟相机聚焦过程，从根本上解决了视觉自回归模型中的混叠问题，实现了更高质量的图像生成。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive models achieve remarkable generation quality through next-scale predictions across multi-scale token pyramids. However, the conventional method uses uniform scale downsampling to build these pyramids, leading to aliasing artifacts that compromise fine details and introduce unwanted jaggies and moiré patterns. To tackle this issue, we present \textbf{FVAR}, which reframes the paradigm from \emph{next-scale prediction} to \emph{next-focus prediction}, mimicking the natural process of camera focusing from blur to clarity. Our approach introduces three key innovations: \textbf{1) Next-Focus Prediction Paradigm} that transforms multi-scale autoregression by progressively reducing blur rather than simply downsampling; \textbf{2) Progressive Refocusing Pyramid Construction} that uses physics-consistent defocus kernels to build clean, alias-free multi-scale representations; and \textbf{3) High-Frequency Residual Learning} that employs a specialized residual teacher network to effectively incorporate alias information during training while maintaining deployment simplicity. Specifically, we construct optical low-pass views using defocus point spread function (PSF) kernels with decreasing radius, creating smooth blur-to-clarity transitions that eliminate aliasing at its source. To further enhance detail generation, we introduce a High-Frequency Residual Teacher that learns from both clean structure and alias residuals, distilling this knowledge to a vanilla VAR deployment network for seamless inference. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FVAR substantially reduces aliasing artifacts, improves fine detail preservation, and enhances text readability, achieving superior performance with perfect compatibility to existing VAR frameworks.

Conclusion: 深度集成模型将概率工具转变为可靠的临床决策支持系统，提供了可信赖和可解释的诊断平台。

Abstract: The utility of deep learning models, such as CheXNet, in high stakes clinical settings is fundamentally constrained by their purely deterministic nature, failing to provide reliable measures of predictive confidence. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating robust Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) into a high performance diagnostic platform for 14 common thoracic diseases on the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset. Initial architectural development failed to stabilize performance and calibration using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), yielding an unacceptable Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.7588. This technical failure necessitated a rigorous architectural pivot to a high diversity, 9-member Deep Ensemble (DE). This resulting DE successfully stabilized performance and delivered superior reliability, achieving a State-of-the-Art (SOTA) average Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.8559 and an average F1 Score of 0.3857. Crucially, the DE demonstrated superior calibration (Mean ECE of 0.0728 and Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of 0.1916) and enabled the reliable decomposition of total uncertainty into its Aleatoric (irreducible data noise) and Epistemic (reducible model knowledge) components, with a mean Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) of 0.0240. These results establish the Deep Ensemble as a trustworthy and explainable platform, transforming the model from a probabilistic tool into a reliable clinical decision support system.

Conclusion: 该方法优于先前的在线测试时自适应方法，验证了设计选择的有效性，能够稳健地利用个人特征提高精度。

Abstract: Online test-time adaptation addresses the train-test domain gap by adapting the model on unlabeled streaming test inputs before making the final prediction. However, online adaptation for 3D human pose estimation suffers from error accumulation when relying on self-supervision with imperfect predictions, leading to degraded performance over time. To mitigate this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel solution that highlights the use of motion discretization. Specifically, we employ unsupervised clustering in the latent motion representation space to derive a set of anchor motions, whose regularity aids in supervising the human pose estimator and enables efficient self-replay. Additionally, we introduce an effective and efficient soft-reset mechanism by reverting the pose estimator to its exponential moving average during continuous adaptation. We examine long-term online adaptation by continuously adapting to out-of-domain streaming test videos of the same individual, which allows for the capture of consistent personal shape and motion traits throughout the streaming observation. By mitigating error accumulation, our solution enables robust exploitation of these personal traits for enhanced accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our solution outperforms previous online test-time adaptation methods and validate our design choices.

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过统计对齐有效缓解了长尾数据集蒸馏中的模型偏差问题，显著提升了蒸馏性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation creates a small distilled set that enables efficient training by capturing key information from the full dataset. While existing dataset distillation methods perform well on balanced datasets, they struggle under long-tailed distributions, where imbalanced class frequencies induce biased model representations and corrupt statistical estimates such as Batch Normalization (BN) statistics. In this paper, we rethink long-tailed dataset distillation by revisiting the limitations of trajectory-based methods, and instead adopt the statistical alignment perspective to jointly mitigate model bias and restore fair supervision. To this end, we introduce three dedicated components that enable unbiased recovery of distilled images and soft relabeling: (1) enhancing expert models (an observer model for recovery and a teacher model for relabeling) to enable reliable statistics estimation and soft-label generation; (2) recalibrating BN statistics via a full forward pass with dynamically adjusted momentum to reduce representation skew; (3) initializing synthetic images by incrementally selecting high-confidence and diverse augmentations via a multi-round mechanism that promotes coverage and diversity. Extensive experiments on four long-tailed benchmarks show consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods across varying degrees of class imbalance.Notably, our approach improves top-1 accuracy by 15.6% on CIFAR-100-LT and 11.8% on Tiny-ImageNet-LT under IPC=10 and IF=10.

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) methods aim to improve performance in four key directions: semantic enhancement, boundary refinement, auxiliary task supervision, and multi-modal fusion. In pursuit of continuous gains, these approaches have evolved toward increasingly sophisticated architectures with multi-stage pipelines, specialized fusion modules, edge-guided learning, and elaborate attention mechanisms. However, this complexity paradoxically introduces feature redundancy and cross-component interference that obscure salient cues, ultimately reaching performance bottlenecks. In contrast, human vision achieves efficient salient object identification without such architectural complexity. This contrast raises a fundamental question: can we design a biologically grounded yet architecturally simple SOD framework that dispenses with most of this engineering complexity, while achieving state-of-the-art accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability? In this work, we answer this question affirmatively by introducing DualGazeNet, a biologically inspired pure Transformer framework that models the dual biological principles of robust representation learning and magnocellular-parvocellular dual-pathway processing with cortical attention modulation in the human visual system. Extensive experiments on five RGB SOD benchmarks show that DualGazeNet consistently surpasses 25 state-of-the-art CNN- and Transformer-based methods. On average, DualGazeNet achieves about 60\% higher inference speed and 53.4\% fewer FLOPs than four Transformer-based baselines of similar capacity (VST++, MDSAM, Sam2unet, and BiRefNet). Moreover, DualGazeNet exhibits strong cross-domain generalization, achieving leading or highly competitive performance on camouflaged and underwater SOD benchmarks without relying on additional modalities.

Result: 在多个MLLM骨干网络上实验表明，ParVTS能剪枝高达88.9%的视觉令牌，性能损失最小，实现1.77倍加速和70%的FLOPs减少。

Conclusion: ParVTS提供了一种无需训练的高效视觉令牌调度方法，兼容多种现有MLLM架构，显著降低计算复杂度而不依赖启发式方法或额外模块。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) deliver impressive vision-language reasoning but suffer steep inference latency because self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length and thousands of visual tokens contributed by high-resolution images. Naively pruning less-informative visual tokens reduces this burden, yet indiscriminate removal can strip away contextual cues essential for background or fine-grained questions, undermining accuracy. In this paper, we present ParVTS (Parallel Vision Token Scheduling), a training-free scheduling framework that partitions visual tokens into subject and non-subject groups, processes them in parallel to transfer their semantics into question tokens, and discards the non-subject path mid-inference to reduce computation. This scheduling reduces computational complexity, requires no heuristics or additional modules, and is compatible with diverse existing MLLM architectures. Experiments across multiple MLLM backbones show that ParVTS prunes up to 88.9% of visual tokens with minimal performance drop, achieving 1.77x speedup and 70% FLOPs reduction.

*Ayca Duran,Christoph Waibel,Bernd Bickel,Iro Armeni,Arno Schlueter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自动化管道，利用建筑立面详细信息和语义分割来识别适合光伏安装的表面并估算太阳能潜力，结果显示可安装潜力远低于理论潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑一体化光伏立面是城市脱碳的重要途径，但目前针对立面的自动化光伏规划方法仍然稀缺且过于简化，需要更精确的方法来支持可靠的城市能源规划。

Method: 基于SegFormer-B5在CMP Facades数据集上进行微调，将语义预测转换为立面级光伏适用性掩码和光伏板布局，考虑模块尺寸和间隙要求。

Result: 在10个城市的373个已知尺寸的立面上应用，结果显示可安装BIPV潜力显著低于理论潜力。

Conclusion: 随着立面图像的可用性增加，该管道可以扩展到支持全球城市的BIPV规划，为城市能源规划提供可靠见解。

Abstract: Building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) facades represent a promising pathway towards urban decarbonization, especially where roof areas are insufficient and ground-mounted arrays are infeasible. Although machine learning-based approaches to support photovoltaic (PV) planning on rooftops are well researched, automated approaches for facades still remain scarce and oversimplified. This paper therefore presents a pipeline that integrates detailed information on the architectural composition of the facade to automatically identify suitable surfaces for PV application and estimate the solar energy potential. The pipeline fine-tunes SegFormer-B5 on the CMP Facades dataset and converts semantic predictions into facade-level PV suitability masks and PV panel layouts considering module sizes and clearances. Applied to a dataset of 373 facades with known dimensions from ten cities, the results show that installable BIPV potential is significantly lower than theoretical potential, thus providing valuable insights for reliable urban energy planning. With the growing availability of facade imagery, the proposed pipeline can be scaled to support BIPV planning in cities worldwide.

TL;DR: MagicWorld是一个交互式视频世界模型，通过整合3D几何先验和历史检索机制，解决了现有方法在视角变化下的结构不稳定性和多步交互中的历史遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式视频世界模型存在两个关键局限：1）未能充分利用指令驱动场景运动与底层3D几何的对应关系，导致视角变化时结构不稳定；2）多步交互中容易遗忘历史信息，造成错误累积和场景语义结构的渐进漂移。

Method: 提出MagicWorld模型，包含两个核心模块：1）动作引导的3D几何模块（AG3D），从每轮交互的首帧构建点云，为视角转换提供显式几何约束；2）历史缓存检索机制（HCR），在生成过程中检索相关历史帧作为条件信号，帮助模型利用过去场景信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，MagicWorld在交互迭代过程中显著提升了场景稳定性和连续性。

Conclusion: MagicWorld通过整合3D几何先验和历史检索机制，有效解决了交互式视频生成中的结构不稳定和历史遗忘问题，为构建更稳定的交互式视频世界模型提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent interactive video world model methods generate scene evolution conditioned on user instructions. Although they achieve impressive results, two key limitations remain. First, they fail to fully exploit the correspondence between instruction-driven scene motion and the underlying 3D geometry, which results in structural instability under viewpoint changes. Second, they easily forget historical information during multi-step interaction, resulting in error accumulation and progressive drift in scene semantics and structure. To address these issues, we propose MagicWorld, an interactive video world model that integrates 3D geometric priors and historical retrieval. MagicWorld starts from a single scene image, employs user actions to drive dynamic scene evolution, and autoregressively synthesizes continuous scenes. We introduce the Action-Guided 3D Geometry Module (AG3D), which constructs a point cloud from the first frame of each interaction and the corresponding action, providing explicit geometric constraints for viewpoint transitions and thereby improving structural consistency. We further propose History Cache Retrieval (HCR) mechanism, which retrieves relevant historical frames during generation and injects them as conditioning signals, helping the model utilize past scene information and mitigate error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that MagicWorld achieves notable improvements in scene stability and continuity across interaction iterations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多功能模型MFmamba，通过单一PAN图像输入实现超分辨率、光谱恢复以及两者的联合任务。模型基于UNet++架构，结合了Mamba上采样块、双池注意力机制和多尺度混合交叉块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像中仅使用高空间分辨率灰度PAN图像来获得高空间分辨率彩色图像的问题。现有方法如超分辨率和着色技术各有局限，需要一种集成方法。

Method: 使用UNet++作为主干网络，结合Mamba上采样块(MUB)、双池注意力(DPA)替代跳跃连接，以及多尺度混合交叉块(MHCB)进行初始特征提取。

Result: 实验表明MFmamba在评估指标和视觉效果上具有竞争力，在三种任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: MFmamba模型能够仅使用输入PAN图像有效实现超分辨率、光谱恢复及其联合任务，为遥感图像处理提供了集成解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are becoming increasingly widespread in military, earth resource exploration. Because of the limitation of a single sensor, we can obtain high spatial resolution grayscale panchromatic (PAN) images and low spatial resolution color multispectral (MS) images. Therefore, an important issue is to obtain a color image with high spatial resolution when there is only a PAN image at the input. The existing methods improve spatial resolution using super-resolution (SR) technology and spectral recovery using colorization technology. However, the SR technique cannot improve the spectral resolution, and the colorization technique cannot improve the spatial resolution. Moreover, the pansharpening method needs two registered inputs and can not achieve SR. As a result, an integrated approach is expected. To solve the above problems, we designed a novel multi-function model (MFmamba) to realize the tasks of SR, spectral recovery, joint SR and spectral recovery through three different inputs. Firstly, MFmamba utilizes UNet++ as the backbone, and a Mamba Upsample Block (MUB) is combined with UNet++. Secondly, a Dual Pool Attention (DPA) is designed to replace the skip connection in UNet++. Finally, a Multi-scale Hybrid Cross Block (MHCB) is proposed for initial feature extraction. Many experiments show that MFmamba is competitive in evaluation metrics and visual results and performs well in the three tasks when only the input PAN image is used.

Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在处理长视频时存在高推理成本问题，需要减少冗余计算。

Method: 基于事件相机原理设计训练免费框架：1）粗到细关键帧采样消除冗余帧；2）自适应token剪枝利用事件视觉显著性；3）结合问题相关性分配token预算。

Conclusion: EventSTU为高效时空视频理解提供了有效解决方案，既支持物理事件相机也支持模拟事件，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: Video large language models have demonstrated strong video understanding capabilities but suffer from high inference costs due to the massive number of tokens in long videos. Inspired by event-based vision, we propose an event-guided, training-free framework for efficient spatio-temporal understanding, named EventSTU. In the temporal domain, we design a coarse-to-fine keyframe sampling algorithm that exploits the change-triggered property of event cameras to eliminate redundant frames. In the spatial domain, we design an adaptive token pruning algorithm that leverages the visual saliency of events as a zero-cost prior to guide spatial reduction. From a holistic spatio-temporal perspective, we further integrate question relevance from keyframe sampling to adaptively allocate token pruning budgets. To facilitate evaluation, we construct EventBench, the first event-inclusive, human-annotated multimodal benchmark that covers diverse real-world scenarios. Beyond physical event cameras, EventSTU also supports general video understanding using simulated events. Comprehensive experiments show that EventSTU achieves 3.01x FLOPs reduction and 3.10x prefilling speedup over the strongest baseline while still improving performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BackdoorVLM是首个针对视觉语言模型(VLMs)的全面后门攻击基准，系统评估了5类多模态后门威胁，发现文本触发器的攻击成功率极高，即使在1%的投毒率下也能达到90%以上的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然后门攻击在单模态环境中已被广泛研究，但在多模态基础模型特别是视觉语言模型中的影响仍未充分探索，需要建立系统评估基准。

Method: 采用统一视角在图像描述和视觉问答等核心任务中注入后门，将多模态后门威胁分为5类：目标拒绝、恶意注入、越狱、概念替换和感知劫持，使用12种代表性攻击方法在2个开源VLMs和3个多模态数据集上进行测试。

Result: VLMs对文本指令表现出强烈敏感性，在双模态后门中文本触发器通常压倒图像触发器形成后门映射，涉及文本模态的后门攻击效果极强。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs存在显著且未被充分探索的漏洞，BackdoorVLM可作为分析和缓解多模态后门威胁的有用基准。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of machine learning systems by injecting hidden behaviors that can be maliciously activated at inference time. While such threats have been extensively studied in unimodal settings, their impact on multimodal foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), remains largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce \textbf{BackdoorVLM}, the first comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating backdoor attacks on VLMs across a broad range of settings. It adopts a unified perspective that injects and analyzes backdoors across core vision-language tasks, including image captioning and visual question answering. BackdoorVLM organizes multimodal backdoor threats into 5 representative categories: targeted refusal, malicious injection, jailbreak, concept substitution, and perceptual hijack. Each category captures a distinct pathway through which an adversary can manipulate a model's behavior. We evaluate these threats using 12 representative attack methods spanning text, image, and bimodal triggers, tested on 2 open-source VLMs and 3 multimodal datasets. Our analysis reveals that VLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to textual instructions, and in bimodal backdoors the text trigger typically overwhelms the image trigger when forming the backdoor mapping. Notably, backdoors involving the textual modality remain highly potent, with poisoning rates as low as 1\% yielding over 90\% success across most tasks. These findings highlight significant, previously underexplored vulnerabilities in current VLMs. We hope that BackdoorVLM can serve as a useful benchmark for analyzing and mitigating multimodal backdoor threats.

TL;DR: One4D是一个统一的4D生成和重建框架，通过统一掩码条件机制处理不同稀疏度的输入帧，能够从单张图像生成4D内容、从完整视频重建4D内容，或在稀疏帧下进行混合生成和重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度图或点云图重建方法在联合RGB和点云图生成时往往失败，会快速降低基础视频模型的质量。需要一种能够同时处理RGB帧和点云图生成的方法。

Method: 采用统一掩码条件机制处理不同稀疏度输入，使用解耦LoRA控制方法，包含两个模态特定的LoRA适配器，通过轻量级零初始化控制链接学习像素级一致性。

Result: 在合成和真实4D数据集上训练后，One4D在生成和重建任务中都能产生高质量的RGB帧和准确的点云图。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了使用视频扩散模型实现通用、高质量基于几何的4D世界建模的重要一步。

Abstract: We present One4D, a unified framework for 4D generation and reconstruction that produces dynamic 4D content as synchronized RGB frames and pointmaps. By consistently handling varying sparsities of conditioning frames through a Unified Masked Conditioning (UMC) mechanism, One4D can seamlessly transition between 4D generation from a single image, 4D reconstruction from a full video, and mixed generation and reconstruction from sparse frames. Our framework adapts a powerful video generation model for joint RGB and pointmap generation, with carefully designed network architectures. The commonly used diffusion finetuning strategies for depthmap or pointmap reconstruction often fail on joint RGB and pointmap generation, quickly degrading the base video model. To address this challenge, we introduce Decoupled LoRA Control (DLC), which employs two modality-specific LoRA adapters to form decoupled computation branches for RGB frames and pointmaps, connected by lightweight, zero-initialized control links that gradually learn mutual pixel-level consistency. Trained on a mixture of synthetic and real 4D datasets under modest computational budgets, One4D produces high-quality RGB frames and accurate pointmaps across both generation and reconstruction tasks. This work represents a step toward general, high-quality geometry-based 4D world modeling using video diffusion models. Project page: https://mizhenxing.github.io/One4D

Motivation: 虽然基于输出分布熵最小化的测试时自适应方法有效，但Transformer的注意力机制提供了额外的无监督学习信号

Method: 最小化CLS令牌到图像补丁的注意力分布熵，鼓励模型在分布偏移下更自信地关注相关图像区域

Result: 注意力熵最小化提高了对各种损坏类型的鲁棒性，同时在干净数据上不会损害性能，在单样本图像流测试时有效

Conclusion: 注意力熵最小化是一种有效的测试时自适应方法，即使在只有单个测试图像可用时也有效

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables models to adapt to distribution shifts at inference time. While entropy minimization over the output distribution has proven effective for TTA, transformers offer an additional unsupervised learning signal through their attention mechanisms. We propose minimizing the entropy of attention distributions from the CLS token to image patches as a novel TTA objective.This approach encourages the model to attend more confidently to relevant image regions under distribution shift and is effective even when only a single test image is available. We demonstrate that attention entropy minimization improves robustness across diverse corruption types while not hurting performance on clean data on a single sample stream of images at test time.

Conclusion: FineXtrol通过新颖的控制信号和层次对比学习，实现了高效、精确的文本驱动运动生成，提升了运动可控性。

Abstract: Recent works have sought to enhance the controllability and precision of text-driven motion generation. Some approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to produce more detailed texts, while others incorporate global 3D coordinate sequences as additional control signals. However, the former often introduces misaligned details and lacks explicit temporal cues, and the latter incurs significant computational cost when converting coordinates to standard motion representations. To address these issues, we propose FineXtrol, a novel control framework for efficient motion generation guided by temporally-aware, precise, user-friendly, and fine-grained textual control signals that describe specific body part movements over time. In support of this framework, we design a hierarchical contrastive learning module that encourages the text encoder to produce more discriminative embeddings for our novel control signals, thereby improving motion controllability. Quantitative results show that FineXtrol achieves strong performance in controllable motion generation, while qualitative analysis demonstrates its flexibility in directing specific body part movements.

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics and embodied AI is largely driven by Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a key challenge remains underexplored: how can we advance LMMs to discover tasks that directly assist humans in open-future scenarios, where human intentions are highly concurrent and dynamic. In this work, we formalize the problem of Human-centric Open-future Task Discovery (HOTD), focusing particularly on identifying tasks that reduce human effort across multiple plausible futures. To facilitate this study, we propose an HOTD-Bench, which features over 2K real-world videos, a semi-automated annotation pipeline, and a simulation-based protocol tailored for open-set future evaluation. Additionally, we propose the Collaborative Multi-Agent Search Tree (CMAST) framework, which decomposes the complex reasoning through a multi-agent system and structures the reasoning process through a scalable search tree module. In our experiments, CMAST achieves the best performance on the HOTD-Bench, significantly surpassing existing LMMs. It also integrates well with existing LMMs, consistently improving performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配模型可能沿轨迹累积误差并将样本推离数据流形，导致感知质量下降，特别是在轻量级或低步数配置中。

Method: 提出速度对比正则化(VeCoR)，在标准流匹配目标基础上增加对比性双向监督：不仅将预测速度与稳定参考方向对齐（正监督），还将其推离不一致的离流形方向（负监督）。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256×256上，VeCoR在SiT-XL/2和REPA-SiT-XL/2骨干网络上分别实现22%和35%的相对FID降低，在MS-COCO文生图任务中进一步获得32%的相对FID增益。

Conclusion: VeCoR将流匹配从单边吸引目标转变为双边训练信号，在低步数和轻量级设置下显著提升了稳定性、收敛性和图像质量。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has recently emerged as a principled and efficient alternative to diffusion models. Standard FM encourages the learned velocity field to follow a target direction; however, it may accumulate errors along the trajectory and drive samples off the data manifold, leading to perceptual degradation, especially in lightweight or low-step configurations.
  To enhance stability and generalization, we extend FM into a balanced attract-repel scheme that provides explicit guidance on both "where to go" and "where not to go." To be formal, we propose \textbf{Velocity Contrastive Regularization (VeCoR)}, a complementary training scheme for flow-based generative modeling that augments the standard FM objective with contrastive, two-sided supervision. VeCoR not only aligns the predicted velocity with a stable reference direction (positive supervision) but also pushes it away from inconsistent, off-manifold directions (negative supervision). This contrastive formulation transforms FM from a purely attractive, one-sided objective into a two-sided training signal, regularizing trajectory evolution and improving perceptual fidelity across datasets and backbones.
  On ImageNet-1K 256$\times$256, VeCoR yields 22\% and 35\% relative FID reductions on SiT-XL/2 and REPA-SiT-XL/2 backbones, respectively, and achieves further FID gains (32\% relative) on MS-COCO text-to-image generation, demonstrating consistent improvements in stability, convergence, and image quality, particularly in low-step and lightweight settings.

Abstract: In addition to evaluating tumor morphology using H&E staining, immunohistochemistry is used to assess the presence of specific proteins within the tissue. However, this is a costly and labor-intensive technique, for which virtual staining, as an image-to-image translation task, offers a promising alternative. Although recent, this is an emerging field of research with 64% of published studies just in 2024. Most studies use publicly available datasets of H&E-IHC pairs from consecutive tissue sections. Recognizing the training challenges, many authors develop complex virtual staining models based on conditional Generative Adversarial Networks, but ignore the impact of adversarial loss on the quality of virtual staining. Furthermore, overlooking the issues of model evaluation, they claim improved performance based on metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, which are not sufficiently robust to evaluate the quality of virtually stained images. In this paper, we developed CSSP2P GAN, which we demonstrate to achieve heightened pathological fidelity through a blind pathological expert evaluation. Furthermore, while iteratively developing our model, we study the impact of the adversarial loss and demonstrate its crucial role in the quality of virtually stained images. Finally, while comparing our model with reference works in the field, we underscore the limitations of the currently used evaluation metrics and demonstrate the superior performance of CSSP2P GAN.

Abstract: Video virtual try-on technology provides a cost-effective solution for creating marketing videos in fashion e-commerce. However, its practical adoption is hindered by two critical limitations. First, the reliance on a single garment image as input in current virtual try-on datasets limits the accurate capture of realistic texture details. Second, most existing methods focus solely on generating full-shot virtual try-on videos, neglecting the business's demand for videos that also provide detailed close-ups. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-resolution dataset for video-based virtual try-on. This dataset offers two key features. First, it provides more detailed information on the garments, which includes high-fidelity images with detailed close-ups and textual descriptions; Second, it uniquely includes full-shot and close-up try-on videos of real human models. Furthermore, accurately assessing consistency becomes significantly more critical for the close-up videos, which demand high-fidelity preservation of garment details. To facilitate such fine-grained evaluation, we propose a new garment consistency metric VGID (Video Garment Inception Distance) that quantifies the preservation of both texture and structure. Our experiments validate these contributions. We demonstrate that by utilizing the detailed images from our dataset, existing video generation models can extract and incorporate texture features, significantly enhancing the realism and detail fidelity of virtual try-on results. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of recent models. The benchmark effectively identifies the texture and structural preservation problems among current methods.

Abstract: Cataract surgery is one of the most commonly performed surgeries worldwide, yet intraoperative complications such as iris prolapse, posterior capsule rupture (PCR), and vitreous loss remain major causes of adverse outcomes. Automated detection of such events could enable early warning systems and objective training feedback. In this work, we propose CataractCompDetect, a complication detection framework that combines phase-aware localization, SAM 2-based tracking, complication-specific risk scoring, and vision-language reasoning for final classification. To validate CataractCompDetect, we curate CataComp, the first cataract surgery video dataset annotated for intraoperative complications, comprising 53 surgeries, including 23 with clinical complications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了单阶段微调策略和广义交错打包方案，用于将预训练CNN转换为FHE友好的形式，实现高效的全同态加密推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度CNN在全同态加密推理中的两个关键挑战：用低阶多项式近似非线性激活函数以减少精度损失，以及克服高分辨率图像处理的密文容量限制。

Method: 使用单阶段微调策略将预训练CNN转换为FHE友好形式，采用低阶多项式；提出广义交错打包方案和配套的同态操作符来处理任意空间分辨率的特征图。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、ImageNet和MS COCO上的实验表明，通过SFT策略获得的FHE友好CNN达到了与使用ReLU或SiLU激活函数的基线相当的准确率，并首次实现了基于FHE的YOLO架构目标检测推理。

Conclusion: 这些进展使得能够在各种CNN架构上实现高效、端到端的FHE推理，为安全计算环境下的深度学习应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: We address two fundamental challenges in adapting general deep CNNs for FHE-based inference: approximating non-linear activations such as ReLU with low-degree polynomials while minimizing accuracy degradation, and overcoming the ciphertext capacity barrier that constrains high-resolution image processing on FHE inference. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a single-stage fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that directly converts pre-trained CNNs into FHE-friendly forms using low-degree polynomials, achieving competitive accuracy with minimal training overhead; and (2) a generalized interleaved packing (GIP) scheme that is compatible with feature maps of virtually arbitrary spatial resolutions, accompanied by a suite of carefully designed homomorphic operators that preserve the GIP-form encryption throughout computation. These advances enable efficient, end-to-end FHE inference across diverse CNN architectures. Experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and MS COCO demonstrate that the FHE-friendly CNNs obtained via our SFT strategy achieve accuracy comparable to baselines using ReLU or SiLU activations. Moreover, this work presents the first demonstration of FHE-based inference for YOLO architectures in object detection leveraging low-degree polynomial activations.

TL;DR: ZEUS是一个零样本视觉语言分割框架，利用预训练的视觉语言模型和文本提示集成，在无需像素级标注的情况下自动生成全玻片图像中的肿瘤分割掩码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤肿瘤活检的准确标注面临挑战，包括形态变异大、组织学模式重叠以及良恶性病变的细微区别。现有视觉语言模型在病理学中主要限于幻灯片级任务或依赖粗粒度交互提示，难以在千兆像素全玻片图像上生成细粒度分割。

Result: 在两个内部数据集（原发性梭形细胞肿瘤和皮肤转移瘤）上展示了竞争性性能，突出了提示设计、领域偏移和机构变异对病理学视觉语言模型的影响。

Conclusion: ZEUS显著减少了标注负担，同时为下游诊断工作流程提供了可扩展、可解释的肿瘤分割方案。

Abstract: Accurate annotation of cutaneous neoplasm biopsies represents a major challenge due to their wide morphological variability, overlapping histological patterns, and the subtle distinctions between benign and malignant lesions. Vision-language foundation models (VLMs), pre-trained on paired image-text corpora, learn joint representations that bridge visual features and diagnostic terminology, enabling zero-shot localization and classification of tissue regions without pixel-level labels. However, most existing VLM applications in histopathology remain limited to slide-level tasks or rely on coarse interactive prompts, and they struggle to produce fine-grained segmentations across gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs). In this work, we introduce a zero-shot visual-language segmentation pipeline for whole-slide images (ZEUS), a fully automated, zero-shot segmentation framework that leverages class-specific textual prompt ensembles and frozen VLM encoders to generate high-resolution tumor masks in WSIs. By partitioning each WSI into overlapping patches, extracting visual embeddings, and computing cosine similarities against text prompts, we generate a final segmentation mask. We demonstrate competitive performance on two in-house datasets, primary spindle cell neoplasms and cutaneous metastases, highlighting the influence of prompt design, domain shifts, and institutional variability in VLMs for histopathology. ZEUS markedly reduces annotation burden while offering scalable, explainable tumor delineation for downstream diagnostic workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台采用不同程度的压缩给深度伪造检测模型带来了泛化和可靠性挑战。现有方法存在局限性：单模态方法在数据压缩下特征退化，多模态方法需要昂贵的数据收集标注，且在现实场景中模态质量或可访问性不一致。

Method: UMCL框架在训练阶段将单一视觉模态转换为三种互补特征：压缩鲁棒的rPPG信号、时间地标动态和预训练视觉语言模型的语义嵌入。通过亲和力驱动的语义对齐策略显式对齐这些特征，并使用跨质量相似性学习策略增强跨压缩率的特征鲁棒性。

Result: 广泛实验表明，该方法在各种压缩率和操作类型下都实现了优越性能，为鲁棒深度伪造检测建立了新基准。即使在单个特征退化时也能保持高检测精度，并通过显式对齐提供特征关系的可解释性洞察。

Conclusion: UMCL框架通过单模态生成多模态特征和显式对齐策略，有效解决了深度伪造检测中的压缩鲁棒性问题，在保持高精度的同时提供了模型可解释性。

Abstract: In deepfake detection, the varying degrees of compression employed by social media platforms pose significant challenges for model generalization and reliability. Although existing methods have progressed from single-modal to multimodal approaches, they face critical limitations: single-modal methods struggle with feature degradation under data compression in social media streaming, while multimodal approaches require expensive data collection and labeling and suffer from inconsistent modal quality or accessibility in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Unimodal-generated Multimodal Contrastive Learning (UMCL) framework for robust cross-compression-rate (CCR) deepfake detection. In the training stage, our approach transforms a single visual modality into three complementary features: compression-robust rPPG signals, temporal landmark dynamics, and semantic embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models. These features are explicitly aligned through an affinity-driven semantic alignment (ASA) strategy, which models inter-modal relationships through affinity matrices and optimizes their consistency through contrastive learning. Subsequently, our cross-quality similarity learning (CQSL) strategy enhances feature robustness across compression rates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across various compression rates and manipulation types, establishing a new benchmark for robust deepfake detection. Notably, our approach maintains high detection accuracy even when individual features degrade, while providing interpretable insights into feature relationships through explicit alignment.

Conclusion: 通过改进多视角一致性表示可以有效提升视频生成模型的3D一致性，为仿真、游戏和电影制作等应用提供更高质量的视频内容。

Abstract: Video generation models have made significant progress in generating realistic content, enabling applications in simulation, gaming, and film making. However, current generated videos still contain visual artifacts arising from 3D inconsistencies, e.g., objects and structures deforming under changes in camera pose, which can undermine user experience and simulation fidelity. Motivated by recent findings on representation alignment for diffusion models, we hypothesize that improving the multi-view consistency of video diffusion representations will yield more 3D-consistent video generation. Through detailed analysis on multiple recent camera-controlled video diffusion models we reveal strong correlations between 3D-consistent representations and videos. We also propose ViCoDR, a new approach for improving the 3D consistency of video models by learning multi-view consistent diffusion representations. We evaluate ViCoDR on camera controlled image-to-video, text-to-video, and multi-view generation models, demonstrating significant improvements in the 3D consistency of the generated videos.

Motivation: 随着合成音视频内容的快速发展，特别是恶意操纵内容的出现，确保数字媒体完整性变得至关重要。需要有效方法来检测和定位深度伪造内容。

Method: 利用音频-视觉语音表示重建(AuViRe)，从一个模态(如唇部运动)重建另一个模态(如音频波形)的语音表示。在伪造视频片段中，跨模态重建更加困难，导致差异放大，从而为精确时序伪造定位提供判别线索。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法：LAV-DF上AP@0.95提升+8.9，AV-Deepfake1M上AP@0.5提升+9.6，野外实验中AUC提升+5.1。

Conclusion: AuViRe方法通过跨模态重建差异有效定位深度伪造的时间片段，在多个基准测试中表现出色，为数字媒体完整性保护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of sophisticated synthetic audio-visual content, e.g., for subtle malicious manipulations, ensuring the integrity of digital media has become paramount. This work presents a novel approach to temporal localization of deepfakes by leveraging Audio-Visual Speech Representation Reconstruction (AuViRe). Specifically, our approach reconstructs speech representations from one modality (e.g., lip movements) based on the other (e.g., audio waveform). Cross-modal reconstruction is significantly more challenging in manipulated video segments, leading to amplified discrepancies, thereby providing robust discriminative cues for precise temporal forgery localization. AuViRe outperforms the state of the art by +8.9 AP@0.95 on LAV-DF, +9.6 AP@0.5 on AV-Deepfake1M, and +5.1 AUC on an in-the-wild experiment. Code available at https://github.com/mever-team/auvire.

Result: 在无条件和条件生成实验中，T2LDM优于现有方法，达到最先进的场景生成效果。

Conclusion: T2LDM能够感知丰富的几何结构，生成详细场景对象，并提供实用的提示范式和见解。

Abstract: Text-to-LiDAR generation can customize 3D data with rich structures and diverse scenes for downstream tasks. However, the scarcity of Text-LiDAR pairs often causes insufficient training priors, generating overly smooth 3D scenes. Moreover, low-quality text descriptions may degrade generation quality and controllability. In this paper, we propose a Text-to-LiDAR Diffusion Model for scene generation, named T2LDM, with a Self-Conditioned Representation Guidance (SCRG). Specifically, SCRG, by aligning to the real representations, provides the soft supervision with reconstruction details for the Denoising Network (DN) in training, while decoupled in inference. In this way, T2LDM can perceive rich geometric structures from data distribution, generating detailed objects in scenes. Meanwhile, we construct a content-composable Text-LiDAR benchmark, T2nuScenes, along with a controllability metric. Based on this, we analyze the effects of different text prompts for LiDAR generation quality and controllability, providing practical prompt paradigms and insights. Furthermore, a directional position prior is designed to mitigate street distortion, further improving scene fidelity. Additionally, by learning a conditional encoder via frozen DN, T2LDM can support multiple conditional tasks, including Sparse-to-Dense, Dense-to-Sparse, and Semantic-to-LiDAR generation. Extensive experiments in unconditional and conditional generation demonstrate that T2LDM outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art scene generation.

Method: 包含两个关键阶段：粗粒度评估模块（使用边缘密度、熵和频域线索评估视觉复杂度）和细粒度精炼模块（根据选定粒度优化注意力计算），通过两个可学习参数α和β端到端优化全局推理与局部感知的平衡。

Result: 综合评估表明Grc-ViT增强了细粒度判别能力，同时在精度和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡。

Conclusion: Grc-ViT通过动态粒度调整有效解决了ViT在局部细节表示上的局限性，为视觉Transformer提供了更高效的架构设计。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in capturing global dependencies but often struggle to efficiently represent fine-grained local details. Existing multi-scale approaches alleviate this issue by integrating hierarchical or hybrid features; however, they rely on fixed patch sizes and introduce redundant computation. To address these limitations, we propose Granularity-driven Vision Transformer (Grc-ViT), a dynamic coarse-to-fine framework that adaptively adjusts visual granularity based on image complexity. It comprises two key stages: (1) Coarse Granularity Evaluation module, which assesses visual complexity using edge density, entropy, and frequency-domain cues to estimate suitable patch and window sizes; (2) Fine-grained Refinement module, which refines attention computation according to the selected granularity, enabling efficient and precise feature learning. Two learnable parameters, α and \b{eta}, are optimized end-to-end to balance global reasoning and local perception. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Grc-ViT enhances fine-grained discrimination while achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Bench-C基准测试和RAS指标，用于评估大视觉语言模型在视觉损坏下的鲁棒性，解决了现有评估方法中低区分度样本主导和准确性指标无法捕捉预测结构退化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大视觉语言模型鲁棒性评估存在两个主要局限：当前数据集中低区分度样本占主导地位，掩盖了模型间的真实鲁棒性差距；传统的基于准确性的指标无法捕捉底层预测结构的退化。

Method: 提出了Bench-C基准测试，通过考虑损坏下的预测不一致性和语义多样性来选择区分度样本；提出了鲁棒性对齐分数(RAS)，从预测不确定性和校准对齐的角度测量logit级预测结构的退化。

Result: 实验发现：1)模型在损坏下表现出不同的行为模式，如错误置信和犹豫；2)轻微损坏可能导致准确性轻微提升，但整体预测结构仍在退化；3)将鲁棒性分解为破坏性和纠正性组件，可以揭示不同模型的失败和恢复模式。

Conclusion: Bench-C和RAS为评估大视觉语言模型在视觉损坏下的鲁棒性提供了更全面的框架，揭示了传统准确性指标无法捕捉的模型行为模式。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning abilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs), their robustness under visual corruptions remains insufficiently studied. Existing evaluation paradigms exhibit two major limitations: 1) the dominance of low-discriminative samples in current datasets masks the real robustness gap between models; and 2) conventional accuracy-based metric fail to capture the degradation of the underlying prediction structure. To bridge these gaps, we introduce Bench-C, a comprehensive benchmark emphasizing discriminative samples for assessing corruption robustness, where a selection strategy is proposed to jointly consider the prediction inconsistency under corruption and the semantic diversity. Furthermore, we propose the Robustness Alignment Score (RAS), a unified metric that measures degradation in logit-level prediction structure by considering the shifts in prediction uncertainty and calibration alignment. Comprehensive experiments and analysis reveal several interesting findings: 1) model behaviors exhibit distinguish patterns under corruptions, such as erroneous confidence and hesitation; 2) despite subtle corruption may lead to a slight accuracy gain, the overall prediction structure still degrades; 3) by decomposing corruption robustness into destructive and corrective components, the distinct failure and recovery patterns across models can be revealed.

Method: 提出ReEXplore框架，包含两个核心组件：回顾性经验回放（在推理时注入精炼的抽象经验）和分层边界选择（将边界排序分解为从粗到细的决策过程）。

Result: 在多个具身探索基准测试中，ReEXplore相比强MLLM基线取得了显著提升，在开源骨干网络下成功率和导航效率都提高了3倍。

Conclusion: ReEXplore实现了鲁棒、可追踪且高效的探索，为MLLM在具身探索任务中的应用提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied exploration is a target-driven process that requires embodied agents to possess fine-grained perception and knowledge-enhanced decision making. While recent attempts leverage MLLMs for exploration due to their strong perceptual and reasoning abilities, we find that MLLM-based embodied agents remain suboptimal in exploring new environments: (i) they rely on profound but stale pre-trained knowledge, (ii) training-based approaches such as imitation learning or reinforcement learning are expensive for long-horizon tasks with sparse outcome rewards, and (iii) frontier-based exploration yields a large, visually nuanced action space that is difficult for MLLMs to make reliable decisions. We address these challenges with ReEXplore, a training-free framework that performs retrospective experience replay to inject distilled, abstract experience at inference time, and hierarchical frontier selection to decompose frontier ranking into coarse-to-fine decisions. Our approach enables robust, traceable, and efficient exploration. Across multiple embodied exploration benchmarks, ReEXplore yields great improvements over strong MLLM baselines, up to 3x higher performance in both success rate and in navigation efficiency under open-source backbones.

Conclusion: PG-DPO有效解决了DPO在扩散模型中的似然位移问题，显著提升了视频生成的偏好对齐性能。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown promising results in aligning generative outputs with human preferences by distinguishing between chosen and rejected samples. However, a critical limitation of DPO is likelihood displacement, where the probabilities of chosen samples paradoxically decrease during training, undermining the quality of generation. Although this issue has been investigated in autoregressive models, its impact within diffusion-based models remains largely unexplored. This gap leads to suboptimal performance in tasks involving video generation. To address this, we conduct a formal analysis of DPO loss through updating policy within the diffusion framework, which describes how the updating of specific training samples influences the model's predictions on other samples. Using this tool, we identify two main failure modes: (1) Optimization Conflict, which arises from small reward margins between chosen and rejected samples, and (2) Suboptimal Maximization, caused by large reward margins. Informed by these insights, we introduce a novel solution named Policy-Guided DPO (PG-DPO), combining Adaptive Rejection Scaling (ARS) and Implicit Preference Regularization (IPR) to effectively mitigate likelihood displacement. Experiments show that PG-DPO outperforms existing methods in both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, offering a robust solution for improving preference alignment in video generation tasks.

Conclusion: Grc-SAM为提示无关分割提供了独特的粒度计算视角，通过集成多粒度注意力机制，将粒度计算与视觉变换器相结合。

Abstract: Prompt-free image segmentation aims to generate accurate masks without manual guidance. Typical pre-trained models, notably Segmentation Anything Model (SAM), generate prompts directly at a single granularity level. However, this approach has two limitations: (1) Localizability, lacking mechanisms for autonomous region localization; (2) Scalability, limited fine-grained modeling at high resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce Granular Computing-driven SAM (Grc-SAM), a coarse-to-fine framework motivated by Granular Computing (GrC). First, the coarse stage adaptively extracts high-response regions from features to achieve precise foreground localization and reduce reliance on external prompts. Second, the fine stage applies finer patch partitioning with sparse local swin-style attention to enhance detail modeling and enable high-resolution segmentation. Third, refined masks are encoded as latent prompt embeddings for the SAM decoder, replacing handcrafted prompts with an automated reasoning process. By integrating multi-granularity attention, Grc-SAM bridges granular computing with vision transformers. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Grc-SAM outperforms baseline methods in both accuracy and scalability. It offers a unique granular computational perspective for prompt-free segmentation.

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has recently demonstrated significant potential in medical image segmentation. Although SAM is primarily trained on 2D images, attempts have been made to apply it to 3D medical image segmentation. However, the pseudo 3D processing used to adapt SAM results in spatial feature loss, limiting its performance. Additionally, most SAM-based methods still rely on manual prompts, which are challenging to implement in real-world scenarios and require extensive external expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce the Decoder Enhanced and Auto Prompt SAM (DEAP-3DSAM) to tackle these limitations. Specifically, we propose a Feature Enhanced Decoder that fuses the original image features with rich and detailed spatial information to enhance spatial features. We also design a Dual Attention Prompter to automatically obtain prompt information through Spatial Attention and Channel Attention. We conduct comprehensive experiments on four public abdominal tumor segmentation datasets. The results indicate that our DEAP-3DSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D image segmentation, outperforming or matching existing manual prompt methods. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

Abstract: WiFi-based human pose estimation (HPE) has attracted increasing attention due to its resilience to occlusion and privacy-preserving compared to camera-based methods. However, existing WiFi-based HPE approaches often employ regression networks that directly map WiFi channel state information (CSI) to 3D joint coordinates, ignoring the inherent topological relationships among human joints. In this paper, we present GraphPose-Fi, a graph-based framework that explicitly models skeletal topology for WiFi-based 3D HPE. Our framework comprises a CNN encoder shared across antennas for subcarrier-time feature extraction, a lightweight attention module that adaptively reweights features over time and across antennas, and a graph-based regression head that combines GCN layers with self-attention to capture local topology and global dependencies. Our proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods on the MM-Fi dataset in various settings. The source code is available at: https://github.com/Cirrick/GraphPose-Fi.

*Mohan Ramesh,Mark Azer,Fabian B. Flohr*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HABIT是一个高保真自动驾驶仿真基准，通过真实人类动作数据集成到CARLA中，暴露了现有自动驾驶代理在行人交互方面的严重缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶仿真缺乏对真实多样人类行为的充分表示，无法捕捉复杂的动态意图和变化响应，这对系统安全部署至关重要。

Method: 通过模块化、可扩展且物理一致的运动重定向管道，将来自动作捕捉和视频的真实人类动作集成到CARLA中，并筛选出4,730个交通兼容的行人动作。

Result: 评估三个最先进的自动驾驶代理显示，在HABIT上表现显著恶化：碰撞次数高达7.43次/公里，AIS 3+伤害风险达12.94%，不必要制动率高达33%。

Conclusion: HABIT揭示了现有评估方法遗漏的关键故障模式，支持可重复的行人感知AI研究，所有组件已公开发布。

Abstract: Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.

Motivation: 现有AIGC检测基准主要关注整图分类，忽略了扩散编辑的定位问题，需要支持细粒度检测的数据集

Method: 构建包含真实世界图像、8种SOTA扩散模型、多轮编辑、VLM驱动的自动编辑管道的DiffSeg30k数据集，并基准测试三种分割方法

Result: 分割模型在整图分类上优于传统伪造分类器，在跨生成器泛化方面表现出潜力，但在图像失真鲁棒性方面面临挑战

Conclusion: DiffSeg30k将推动AIGC细粒度定位研究，展示了基于分割方法的潜力和局限性

Abstract: Diffusion-based editing enables realistic modification of local image regions, making AI-generated content harder to detect. Existing AIGC detection benchmarks focus on classifying entire images, overlooking the localization of diffusion-based edits. We introduce DiffSeg30k, a publicly available dataset of 30k diffusion-edited images with pixel-level annotations, designed to support fine-grained detection. DiffSeg30k features: 1) In-the-wild images--we collect images or image prompts from COCO to reflect real-world content diversity; 2) Diverse diffusion models--local edits using eight SOTA diffusion models; 3) Multi-turn editing--each image undergoes up to three sequential edits to mimic real-world sequential editing; and 4) Realistic editing scenarios--a vision-language model (VLM)-based pipeline automatically identifies meaningful regions and generates context-aware prompts covering additions, removals, and attribute changes. DiffSeg30k shifts AIGC detection from binary classification to semantic segmentation, enabling simultaneous localization of edits and identification of the editing models. We benchmark three baseline segmentation approaches, revealing significant challenges in semantic segmentation tasks, particularly concerning robustness to image distortions. Experiments also reveal that segmentation models, despite being trained for pixel-level localization, emerge as highly reliable whole-image classifiers of diffusion edits, outperforming established forgery classifiers while showing great potential in cross-generator generalization. We believe DiffSeg30k will advance research in fine-grained localization of AI-generated content by demonstrating the promise and limitations of segmentation-based methods.

TL;DR: 3M-TI是一个无需校准的多相机跨模态扩散框架，用于解决移动热成像传感器空间分辨率低的问题，通过跨模态自注意力模块在去噪过程中自适应对齐热成像和RGB特征，显著提升热图像质量。

Conclusion: 3M-TI通过校准自由的跨模态扩散框架有效提升了移动热成像的空间分辨率、结构保真度和纹理细节，为鲁棒的移动热感知系统提供了实用价值。

Abstract: The miniaturization of thermal sensors for mobile platforms inherently limits their spatial resolution and textural fidelity, leading to blurry and less informative images. Existing thermal super-resolution (SR) methods can be grouped into single-image and RGB-guided approaches: the former struggles to recover fine structures from limited information, while the latter relies on accurate and laborious cross-camera calibration, which hinders practical deployment and robustness. Here, we propose 3M-TI, a calibration-free Multi-camera cross-Modality diffusion framework for Mobile Thermal Imaging. At its core, 3M-TI integrates a cross-modal self-attention module (CSM) into the diffusion UNet, replacing the original self-attention layers to adaptively align thermal and RGB features throughout the denoising process, without requiring explicit camera calibration. This design enables the diffusion network to leverage its generative prior to enhance spatial resolution, structural fidelity, and texture detail in the super-resolved thermal images. Extensive evaluations on real-world mobile thermal cameras and public benchmarks validate our superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. More importantly, the thermal images enhanced by 3M-TI lead to substantial gains in critical downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation, underscoring its practical value for robust mobile thermal perception systems.

Result: 揭示了先进视觉语言模型在单目空间推理任务上的局限性，分析了辅助信息的重要性。

Conclusion: 为推进真实世界开放环境中的单目空间推理奠定了基础，提供了未来模型设计的实用指导。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning (SR), the ability to infer 3D spatial information from 2D inputs, is essential for real-world applications such as embodied AI and autonomous driving. However, existing research primarily focuses on indoor environments and typically relies on multi-view observations, which limits their generalizability to outdoor scenarios and constrains their applicability to monocular images, the most common real-world setting. In this work, we propose MonoSR, a large-scale monocular spatial reasoning dataset that spans diverse scenarios including indoor, outdoor, and object-centric settings, and supports multiple question types. MonoSR provides a path toward open-world monocular spatial reasoning. Beyond introducing the dataset, we evaluate advanced vision-language models to reveal their limitations on this challenging task. We further analyze whether auxiliary information is crucial for monocular spatial reasoning and offer practical guidance for designing future models. These contributions collectively establish a foundation for advancing monocular spatial reasoning in real-world, open-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SemAnti方法，通过冻结CLIP的语义子空间并仅调整对生成痕迹敏感的层，在打乱语义的情况下实现更鲁棒的AI生成图像检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CLIP检测器过度依赖语义线索而非生成器痕迹，导致在分布变化下性能脆弱。需要解决语义偏差问题以提升AI生成图像检测的泛化能力。

Method: 提出SemAnti语义对抗微调范式：1）使用Patch Shuffle破坏全局语义连续性但保留局部痕迹线索；2）冻结语义子空间；3）仅调整对生成痕迹敏感的层

Result: 在AIGCDetectBenchmark和GenImage数据集上实现了最先进的跨域泛化性能，证明了调节语义对于释放CLIP在AI生成图像检测中全部潜力的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过抑制语义偏差和调节语义结构，可以显著提升CLIP在AI生成图像检测中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的小目标检测面临分辨率低和背景杂乱的挑战，现有RGB和红外数据融合方法在跨模态交互和计算效率之间存在权衡困难。

Method: 使用双门控互补Mamba融合模块（DGC-MFM）通过光照感知和差异感知门控机制自适应平衡RGB和红外模态，以及分层特征聚合颈部（HFAN）采用"先优化后融合"策略增强多尺度特征。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和速度之间实现了优越平衡，非常适合实际无人机应用。

Abstract: Small object detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery is a persistent challenge, hindered by low resolution and background clutter. While fusing RGB and infrared (IR) data offers a promising solution, existing methods often struggle with the trade-off between effective cross-modal interaction and computational efficiency. In this letter, we introduce MambaRefine-YOLO. Its core contributions are a Dual-Gated Complementary Mamba fusion module (DGC-MFM) that adaptively balances RGB and IR modalities through illumination-aware and difference-aware gating mechanisms, and a Hierarchical Feature Aggregation Neck (HFAN) that uses a ``refine-then-fuse'' strategy to enhance multi-scale features. Our comprehensive experiments validate this dual-pronged approach. On the dual-modality DroneVehicle dataset, the full model achieves a state-of-the-art mAP of 83.2%, an improvement of 7.9% over the baseline. On the single-modality VisDrone dataset, a variant using only the HFAN also shows significant gains, demonstrating its general applicability. Our work presents a superior balance between accuracy and speed, making it highly suitable for real-world UAV applications.

Abstract: Film set design plays a pivotal role in cinematic storytelling and shaping the visual atmosphere. However, the traditional process depends on expert-driven manual modeling, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we introduce FilmSceneDesigner, an automated scene generation system that emulates professional film set design workflow. Given a natural language description, including scene type, historical period, and style, we design an agent-based chaining framework to generate structured parameters aligned with film set design workflow, guided by prompt strategies that ensure parameter accuracy and coherence. On the other hand, we propose a procedural generation pipeline which executes a series of dedicated functions with the structured parameters for floorplan and structure generation, material assignment, door and window placement, and object retrieval and layout, ultimately constructing a complete film scene from scratch. Moreover, to enhance cinematic realism and asset diversity, we construct SetDepot-Pro, a curated dataset of 6,862 film-specific 3D assets and 733 materials. Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate that our system produces structurally sound scenes with strong cinematic fidelity, supporting downstream tasks such as virtual previs, construction drawing and mood board creation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ABM-LoRA是一种通过对齐预训练模型和适配器激活边界来加速低秩适配器收敛的初始化策略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的随机初始化导致梯度更新在错配的切空间中进行，造成信息损失并阻碍早期收敛

Method: 在下游训练前将适配器的激活边界与预训练模型对齐，最大化全参数梯度在适配器子空间中的投影

Result: 在语言理解、对话生成和视觉识别任务中显著加速收敛，在VTAB-1K上达到最高准确率，在需要几何理解的结构化推理任务上表现突出

Conclusion: ABM-LoRA通过激活边界对齐有效减少信息损失，提供更低的初始损失和更快的收敛速度

Abstract: We propose Activation Boundary Matching for Low-Rank Adaptation (ABM-LoRA), a principled initialization strategy that substantially accelerates the convergence of low-rank adapters. While LoRA offers high parameter efficiency, its random initialization restricts gradient updates to a mismatched tangent space, causing significant information loss and hindering early convergence. Our ABM-LoRA addresses this by aligning the adapter's activation boundaries with those of the pretrained model before downstream training, thereby maximizing the projection of full-parameter gradients into the adapter subspace. This alignment sharply reduces information loss at initialization, yields a lower starting loss, and accelerates convergence. We demonstrate ABM-LoRA's effectiveness across diverse architectures and tasks: language understanding (T5-Base on GLUE), dialogue generation (LLaMA2-7B on WizardLM), and vision recognition (ViT-B/16 on VTAB-1K). On VTAB-1K, it achieves the highest accuracy among all methods, with strong gains on structured reasoning tasks requiring geometric understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 单一基础模型在源自由域自适应中语义覆盖有限，无法捕捉域偏移下的多样化上下文线索，需要利用多个互补基础模型。

Method: CoMA框架联合利用两个不同基础模型，采用双向适应机制对齐目标模型并保持语义区分性，引入分解互信息确保小批量训练的稳定性。

Conclusion: 多基础模型协作能有效提升源自由域自适应的性能，分解互信息解决了小批量训练中的稳定性问题。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without access to source data. Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have introduced new opportunities for leveraging external semantic knowledge to guide SFDA. However, relying on a single FM is often insufficient, as it tends to bias adaptation toward a restricted semantic coverage, failing to capture diverse contextual cues under domain shift. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Collaborative Multi-foundation Adaptation (CoMA) framework that jointly leverages two different FMs (e.g., CLIP and BLIP) with complementary properties to capture both global semantics and local contextual cues. Specifically, we employ a bidirectional adaptation mechanism that (1) aligns different FMs with the target model for task adaptation while maintaining their semantic distinctiveness, and (2) transfers complementary knowledge from the FMs to the target model. To ensure stable adaptation under mini-batch training, we introduce Decomposed Mutual Information (DMI) that selectively enhances true dependencies while suppressing false dependencies arising from incomplete class coverage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SFDA methods across four benchmarks, including Office-31, Office-Home, DomainNet-126, and VisDA, under the closed-set setting, while also achieving best results on partial-set and open-set variants.

Motivation: 现有预训练和零样本图像恢复方法往往无法与人类偏好对齐，恢复的图像可能不受欢迎。需要在不重新训练模型且无需收集大量偏好数据的情况下，提升恢复质量并灵活适应各种任务。

Method: 设计无训练的三阶段流程：1) 基于初始恢复图像使用扩散反演和去噪在线生成候选偏好图像；2) 使用自动化偏好对齐指标或人工反馈选择偏好图像；3) 将选定图像作为奖励信号指导扩散去噪过程，优化恢复图像。

Result: 在各种图像恢复任务和模型上的广泛实验证明了该流程的有效性和灵活性。

Conclusion: TTPO范式能够有效提升图像恢复的感知质量，生成符合人类偏好的结果，且兼容任何图像恢复模型骨干。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) models are typically trained to recover high-quality images using L1 or LPIPS loss. To handle diverse unknown degradations, zero-shot IR methods have also been introduced. However, existing pre-trained and zero-shot IR approaches often fail to align with human preferences, resulting in restored images that may not be favored. This highlights the critical need to enhance restoration quality and adapt flexibly to various image restoration tasks or backbones without requiring model retraining and ideally without labor-intensive preference data collection. In this paper, we propose the first Test-Time Preference Optimization (TTPO) paradigm for image restoration, which enhances perceptual quality, generates preference data on-the-fly, and is compatible with any IR model backbone. Specifically, we design a training-free, three-stage pipeline: (i) generate candidate preference images online using diffusion inversion and denoising based on the initially restored image; (ii) select preferred and dispreferred images using automated preference-aligned metrics or human feedback; and (iii) use the selected preference images as reward signals to guide the diffusion denoising process, optimizing the restored image to better align with human preferences. Extensive experiments across various image restoration tasks and models demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed pipeline.

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting and its derivatives have achieved significant breakthroughs in large-scale scene reconstruction. However, how to efficiently and stably achieve high-quality geometric fidelity remains a core challenge. To address this issue, we introduce MetroGS, a novel Gaussian Splatting framework for efficient and robust reconstruction in complex urban environments. Our method is built upon a distributed 2D Gaussian Splatting representation as the core foundation, serving as a unified backbone for subsequent modules. To handle potential sparse regions in complex scenes, we propose a structured dense enhancement scheme that utilizes SfM priors and a pointmap model to achieve a denser initialization, while incorporating a sparsity compensation mechanism to improve reconstruction completeness. Furthermore, we design a progressive hybrid geometric optimization strategy that organically integrates monocular and multi-view optimization to achieve efficient and accurate geometric refinement. Finally, to address the appearance inconsistency commonly observed in large-scale scenes, we introduce a depth-guided appearance modeling approach that learns spatial features with 3D consistency, facilitating effective decoupling between geometry and appearance and further enhancing reconstruction stability. Experiments on large-scale urban datasets demonstrate that MetroGS achieves superior geometric accuracy, rendering quality, offering a unified solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 3D生物医学图像语义分割依赖大量标注数据，但人工标注成本高且需要专业知识。主动学习旨在通过选择信息量最大的样本来减少标注工作量，但在3D生物医学成像领域尚无共识证明主动学习始终优于随机采样。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is crucial for various biomedical applications, yet its reliance on large annotated datasets presents a bottleneck due to the high cost and specialized expertise required for manual labeling. Active Learning (AL) aims to mitigate this challenge by querying only the most informative samples, thereby reducing annotation effort. However, in the domain of 3D biomedical imaging, there is no consensus on whether AL consistently outperforms Random sampling. Four evaluation pitfalls hinder the current methodological assessment. These are (1) restriction to too few datasets and annotation budgets, (2) using 2D models on 3D images without partial annotations, (3) Random baseline not being adapted to the task, and (4) measuring annotation cost only in voxels. In this work, we introduce nnActive, an open-source AL framework that overcomes these pitfalls by (1) means of a large scale study spanning four biomedical imaging datasets and three label regimes, (2) extending nnU-Net by using partial annotations for training with 3D patch-based query selection, (3) proposing Foreground Aware Random sampling strategies tackling the foreground-background class imbalance of medical images and (4) propose the foreground efficiency metric, which captures the low annotation cost of background-regions. We reveal the following findings: (A) while all AL methods outperform standard Random sampling, none reliably surpasses an improved Foreground Aware Random sampling; (B) benefits of AL depend on task specific parameters; (C) Predictive Entropy is overall the best performing AL method, but likely requires the most annotation effort; (D) AL performance can be improved with more compute intensive design choices. As a holistic, open-source framework, nnActive can serve as a catalyst for research and application of AL in 3D biomedical imaging. Code is at: https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive

Abstract: Detecting deepfake images is crucial in combating misinformation. We present a lightweight, generalizable binary classification model based on EfficientNet-B6, fine-tuned with transformation techniques to address severe class imbalances. By leveraging robust preprocessing, oversampling, and optimization strategies, our model achieves high accuracy, stability, and generalization. While incorporating Fourier transform-based phase and amplitude features showed minimal impact, our proposed framework helps non-experts to effectively identify deepfake images, making significant strides toward accessible and reliable deepfake detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理器官模型的自动化3D解剖数据生成工作流，用于解决手术规划和训练中3D模型数据匮乏的问题，特别针对成像对比度差的软组织器官如前列腺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术规划和训练需要大量从医学影像重建的3D解剖模型，但由于法律、伦理和技术挑战，从真实患者获取这些数据非常困难，特别是对于前列腺等成像对比度差的软组织器官。

Method: 使用物理器官模型获取数据，通过3D生成对抗网络(GAN)获得3D模型流形；使用仿生水凝胶制作人工前列腺模型，在多区域具有成像对比度；通过定制超声扫描仪记录手术前后数据；训练神经网络进行超声图像分割。

Conclusion: 该工作流能够有效生成用于下游机器学习任务的3D解剖数据，解决了手术规划和训练中数据获取的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Surgical planning and training based on machine learning requires a large amount of 3D anatomical models reconstructed from medical imaging, which is currently one of the major bottlenecks. Obtaining these data from real patients and during surgery is very demanding, if even possible, due to legal, ethical, and technical challenges. It is especially difficult for soft tissue organs with poor imaging contrast, such as the prostate. To overcome these challenges, we present a novel workflow for automated 3D anatomical data generation using data obtained from physical organ models. We additionally use a 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to obtain a manifold of 3D models useful for other downstream machine learning tasks that rely on 3D data. We demonstrate our workflow using an artificial prostate model made of biomimetic hydrogels with imaging contrast in multiple zones. This is used to physically simulate endoscopic surgery. For evaluation and 3D data generation, we place it into a customized ultrasound scanner that records the prostate before and after the procedure. A neural network is trained to segment the recorded ultrasound images, which outperforms conventional, non-learning-based computer vision techniques in terms of intersection over union (IoU). Based on the segmentations, a 3D mesh model is reconstructed, and performance feedback is provided.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了CLIP等视觉语言模型是否能区分真实物体与其相似物（如玩具、雕像、绘画等），提出了RoLA数据集并开发了在CLIP嵌入空间中区分真实与相似物的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管计算机视觉模型在识别基准上表现良好，但与人类感知相比仍存在差距，特别是在判断图像是否像某个物体而非其实例的微妙能力方面。

Method: 构建了RoLA数据集，包含真实物体和相似物样本；首先评估基于提示的基线方法，然后在CLIP嵌入空间中估计从真实到相似物的方向向量。

Result: 应用该方向向量到图像和文本嵌入中，改善了Conceptual12M上的跨模态检索性能，并提升了CLIP前缀字幕生成器的字幕质量。

Conclusion: CLIP模型能够捕捉真实物体与相似物之间的区别，通过在嵌入空间中学习区分方向可以提升模型的感知能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in computer vision have yielded models with strong performance on recognition benchmarks; however, significant gaps remain in comparison to human perception. One subtle ability is to judge whether an image looks like a given object without being an instance of that object. We study whether vision-language models such as CLIP capture this distinction. We curated a dataset named RoLA (Real or Lookalike) of real and lookalike exemplars (e.g., toys, statues, drawings, pareidolia) across multiple categories, and first evaluate a prompt-based baseline with paired "real"/"lookalike" prompts. We then estimate a direction in CLIP's embedding space that moves representations between real and lookalike. Applying this direction to image and text embeddings improves discrimination in cross-modal retrieval on Conceptual12M, and also enhances captions produced by a CLIP prefix captioner.

Abstract: Text-to-motion generation, which synthesizes 3D human motions from text inputs, holds immense potential for applications in gaming, film, and robotics. Recently, diffusion-based methods have been shown to generate more diversity and realistic motion. However, there exists a misalignment between text and motion distributions in diffusion models, which leads to semantically inconsistent or low-quality motions. To address this limitation, we propose Reward-guided sampling Alignment (ReAlign), comprising a step-aware reward model to assess alignment quality during the denoising sampling and a reward-guided strategy that directs the diffusion process toward an optimally aligned distribution. This reward model integrates step-aware tokens and combines a text-aligned module for semantic consistency and a motion-aligned module for realism, refining noisy motions at each timestep to balance probability density and alignment. Extensive experiments of both motion generation and retrieval tasks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves text-motion alignment and motion quality compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: Percept-WAM是一个感知增强的世界感知-动作模型，首次在单一视觉语言模型中隐式集成2D/3D场景理解能力，通过World-PV和World-BEV令牌统一空间感知任务，显著提升自动驾驶在长尾场景和复杂交互中的感知稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶系统在空间感知方面存在准确性和稳定性不足的问题，特别是在长尾场景和复杂交互中。现有的视觉语言模型在空间定位和理解方面较弱，导致基于这些模型的VLA系统感知和定位能力有限。

Method: 提出Percept-WAM模型，通过World-PV和World-BEV令牌编码空间坐标和置信度，统一2D/3D感知任务。采用网格条件预测机制进行密集目标感知，包含IoU感知评分和并行自回归解码，提升长尾、远距离和小目标场景的稳定性。

Result: 在COCO 2D检测上达到51.7/58.9 mAP，在nuScenes BEV 3D检测上表现优异。与轨迹解码器集成后，在nuScenes和NAVSIM上规划性能提升，在NAVSIM上超越DiffusionDrive 2.1 PMDS。定性结果显示了强大的开放词汇和长尾泛化能力。

Conclusion: Percept-WAM成功将2D/3D感知能力集成到单一VLM中，显著提升了自动驾驶系统的感知准确性和稳定性，特别是在具有挑战性的场景中，同时保持了通用智能能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving heavily relies on accurate and robust spatial perception. Many failures arise from inaccuracies and instability, especially in long-tail scenarios and complex interactions. However, current vision-language models are weak at spatial grounding and understanding, and VLA systems built on them therefore show limited perception and localization ability. To address these challenges, we introduce Percept-WAM, a perception-enhanced World-Awareness-Action Model that is the first to implicitly integrate 2D/3D scene understanding abilities within a single vision-language model (VLM). Instead of relying on QA-style spatial reasoning, Percept-WAM unifies 2D/3D perception tasks into World-PV and World-BEV tokens, which encode both spatial coordinates and confidence. We propose a grid-conditioned prediction mechanism for dense object perception, incorporating IoU-aware scoring and parallel autoregressive decoding, improving stability in long-tail, far-range, and small-object scenarios. Additionally, Percept-WAM leverages pretrained VLM parameters to retain general intelligence (e.g., logical reasoning) and can output perception results and trajectory control outputs directly. Experiments show that Percept-WAM matches or surpasses classical detectors and segmenters on downstream perception benchmarks, achieving 51.7/58.9 mAP on COCO 2D detection and nuScenes BEV 3D detection. When integrated with trajectory decoders, it further improves planning performance on nuScenes and NAVSIM, e.g., surpassing DiffusionDrive by 2.1 in PMDS on NAVSIM. Qualitative results further highlight its strong open-vocabulary and long-tail generalization.

Motivation: 现有动态场景重建方法要么依赖昂贵的人工标注，要么使用时间变化表示但缺乏明确的物体级分解，导致静态和动态元素交织，难以分离场景。

Method: 将动态物体建模为经历刚性变换的连贯实例；使用基于语言的零样本视频跟踪与激光雷达3D锚定；通过特征对应估计一致位姿；引入协调转向平滑方案获得时空一致的运动轨迹；联合优化物体位姿和高斯参数。

Conclusion: IDSplat为大规模自动驾驶应用提供了一种实用的动态场景重建解决方案，无需人工标注即可实现高质量的实例分解重建。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic driving scenes is essential for developing autonomous systems through sensor-realistic simulation. Although recent methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions, they either rely on costly human annotations for object trajectories or use time-varying representations without explicit object-level decomposition, leading to intertwined static and dynamic elements that hinder scene separation. We present IDSplat, a self-supervised 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that reconstructs dynamic scenes with explicit instance decomposition and learnable motion trajectories, without requiring human annotations. Our key insight is to model dynamic objects as coherent instances undergoing rigid transformations, rather than unstructured time-varying primitives. For instance decomposition, we employ zero-shot, language-grounded video tracking anchored to 3D using lidar, and estimate consistent poses via feature correspondences. We introduce a coordinated-turn smoothing scheme to obtain temporally and physically consistent motion trajectories, mitigating pose misalignments and tracking failures, followed by joint optimization of object poses and Gaussian parameters. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive reconstruction quality while maintaining instance-level decomposition and generalizes across diverse sequences and view densities without retraining, making it practical for large-scale autonomous driving applications. Code will be released.

Motivation: 当前最先进的视觉语言模型在3D空间理解和长视频理解方面仍然表现不佳，尽管在典型视觉语言任务上很强大。现有方法通常需要专门架构设计来分别改进3D任务和视频理解任务。

Method: 提出LAST方法，让VLMs在给出最终答案前在空间和时间维度进行思考，构建3D空间和时间维度的视觉思考轨迹。支持两种场景：零样本直接提示专有模型，以及使用包含空间和时间思考轨迹的数据微调通用VLMs。

Result: LAST在各种基准测试中带来显著提升，包括3个空间理解、4个视频理解和3个图像理解任务。在EgoSchema上使用GPT-4o零样本提升15.8%，在VSI-Bench上相比Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升8.3分。

Conclusion: LAST方法有效提升了视觉语言模型在3D空间和长视频理解方面的能力，通过让模型在空间和时间维度进行思考，仅使用2D图像输入就能实现联合改进。

Abstract: Humans can perceive and understand 3D space and long videos from sequential visual observations. But do vision-language models (VLMs) can? Recent work demonstrates that even state-of-the-art VLMs still struggle to understand 3D space and long videos, although they are powerful in typical vision-language tasks. Current methods often rely on specialized architectural designs to improve performance for 3D tasks and video understanding tasks separately. In contrast, we propose LAST, short for LeArn to Think in Space and Time, to jointly improve 3D spatial and long video understanding for general VLMs with only a set of 2D images as inputs. LAST makes VLMs think in space and time rather than only with text before giving the final answer, building visual thinking trajectories in 3D space and temporal dimension. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LAST in two scenarios: 1) zero-shot, where we directly prompt proprietary models; and 2) fine-tuning general VLMs with data that include thinking trajectories in 3D space and time. We show that LAST brings substantial gains in various benchmarks, including 3 spatial understanding, 4 video understanding, and 3 image understanding tasks. Notably, 15.8% gains on EgoSchema with GPT-4o in a zero-shot manner and 8.3 gains on VSI-Bench compared with Qwen2.5-VL-7B.

Motivation: 当前条件图像生成方法在处理文本提示和条件图像之间的冲突时存在困难，包括输入级冲突和模型偏差冲突，需要更精细的解决方案

Method: 提出双向解耦DPO框架(BideDPO)，创建两个解耦的偏好对（一个用于条件，一个用于文本），采用自适应损失平衡策略，并构建自动化数据管道进行迭代优化

Result: 实验显示BideDPO显著提升文本成功率（如+35%）和条件遵循度，在DualAlign基准测试中表现出色

Conclusion: BideDPO框架有效解决了条件图像生成中的冲突问题，为多约束任务提供了可行的优化方案

Abstract: Conditional image generation enhances text-to-image synthesis with structural, spatial, or stylistic priors, but current methods face challenges in handling conflicts between sources. These include 1) input-level conflicts, where the conditioning image contradicts the text prompt, and 2) model-bias conflicts, where generative biases disrupt alignment even when conditions match the text. Addressing these conflicts requires nuanced solutions, which standard supervised fine-tuning struggles to provide. Preference-based optimization techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) show promise but are limited by gradient entanglement between text and condition signals and lack disentangled training data for multi-constraint tasks. To overcome this, we propose a bidirectionally decoupled DPO framework (BideDPO). Our method creates two disentangled preference pairs-one for the condition and one for the text-to reduce gradient entanglement. The influence of pairs is managed using an Adaptive Loss Balancing strategy for balanced optimization. We introduce an automated data pipeline to sample model outputs and generate conflict-aware data. This process is embedded in an iterative optimization strategy that refines both the model and the data. We construct a DualAlign benchmark to evaluate conflict resolution between text and condition. Experiments show BideDPO significantly improves text success rates (e.g., +35%) and condition adherence. We also validate our approach using the COCO dataset.

Conclusion: 基于似然的方法揭示了数据选择中的信息洞察，阐明了数据分布特征与模型学习偏好之间的相互作用

Abstract: Existing core-set selection methods predominantly rely on heuristic scoring signals such as training dynamics or model uncertainty, lacking explicit modeling of data likelihood. This omission may hinder the constructed subset from capturing subtle yet critical distributional structures that underpin effective model training. In this work, we propose a novel, theoretically grounded approach that leverages diffusion models to estimate data likelihood via reconstruction deviation induced by partial reverse denoising. Specifically, we establish a formal connection between reconstruction error and data likelihood, grounded in the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) of Markovian diffusion processes, thereby enabling a principled, distribution-aware scoring criterion for data selection. Complementarily, we introduce an efficient information-theoretic method to identify the optimal reconstruction timestep, ensuring that the deviation provides a reliable signal indicative of underlying data likelihood. Extensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that reconstruction deviation offers an effective scoring criterion, consistently outperforming existing baselines across selection ratios, and closely matching full-data training using only 50% of the data. Further analysis shows that the likelihood-informed nature of our score reveals informative insights in data selection, shedding light on the interplay between data distributional characteristics and model learning preferences.

Conclusion: ReMatch框架通过充分利用MLLM的生成和推理能力，显著提升了多模态检索的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We present ReMatch, a framework that leverages the generative strength of MLLMs for multimodal retrieval. Previous approaches treated an MLLM as a simple encoder, ignoring its generative nature, and under-utilising its compositional reasoning and world knowledge. We instead train the embedding MLLM end-to-end with a chat-style generative matching stage. The matching stage uses the same MLLM to autoregressively decide relevance from multi-view inputs, including both raw data and its own projected embeddings for each query and document. It provides instance-wise discrimination supervision that complements a standard contrastive loss, offering stronger gradients on hard negatives and preserving the compositional strengths of the original MLLM. To obtain semantically richer multimodal embeddings, we use multiple learnable tokens to augment each input, generating fine-grained contextual, mutually orthogonal embeddings with low inference cost. Leveraging our established high-performance baseline,we assemble the ideas mentioned above into a powerful training recipe and achieve a new state-of-the-art on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB). Our experiments show particularly strong zero-shot generalization results on five datasets, highlighting the robustness and transferability of ReMatch.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods, particularly their reliance on adaptive density control, which can lead to floating artifacts and inefficient resource usage. We propose a novel densify beforehand approach that enhances the initialization of 3D scenes by combining sparse LiDAR data with monocular depth estimation from corresponding RGB images. Our ROI-aware sampling scheme prioritizes semantically and geometrically important regions, yielding a dense point cloud that improves visual fidelity and computational efficiency. This densify beforehand approach bypasses the adaptive density control that may introduce redundant Gaussians in the original pipeline, allowing the optimization to focus on the other attributes of 3D Gaussian primitives, reducing overlap while enhancing visual quality. Our method achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art techniques while significantly lowering resource consumption and training time. We validate our approach through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on four newly collected datasets, showcasing its effectiveness in preserving regions of interest in complex scenes.

Conclusion: IDEAL-M3D通过实例级选择和多样性集成有效解决了单目3D检测中的标注效率问题，实现了显著的资源节省和性能提升。

Abstract: Monocular 3D detection relies on just a single camera and is therefore easy to deploy. Yet, achieving reliable 3D understanding from monocular images requires substantial annotation, and 3D labels are especially costly. To maximize performance under constrained labeling budgets, it is essential to prioritize annotating samples expected to deliver the largest performance gains. This prioritization is the focus of active learning. Curiously, we observed two significant limitations in active learning algorithms for 3D monocular object detection. First, previous approaches select entire images, which is inefficient, as non-informative instances contained in the same image also need to be labeled. Secondly, existing methods rely on uncertainty-based selection, which in monocular 3D object detection creates a bias toward depth ambiguity. Consequently, distant objects are selected, while nearby objects are overlooked.
  To address these limitations, we propose IDEAL-M3D, the first instance-level pipeline for monocular 3D detection. For the first time, we demonstrate that an explicitly diverse, fast-to-train ensemble improves diversity-driven active learning for monocular 3D. We induce diversity with heterogeneous backbones and task-agnostic features, loss weight perturbation, and time-dependent bagging. IDEAL-M3D shows superior performance and significant resource savings: with just 60% of the annotations, we achieve similar or better AP3D on KITTI validation and test set results compared to training the same detector on the whole dataset.

Conclusion: DGSPNet通过语言提示驱动框架有效解决了红外小目标检测中的特征表示有限和背景干扰严重的问题，无需依赖标注即可实现高性能检测。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection remains challenging due to limited feature representation and severe background interference, resulting in sub-optimal performance. While recent CLIP-inspired methods attempt to leverage textual guidance for detection, they are hindered by inaccurate text descriptions and reliance on manual annotations. To overcome these limitations, we propose DGSPNet, an end-to-end language prompt-driven framework. Our approach integrates dual-granularity semantic prompts: coarse-grained textual priors (e.g., 'infrared image', 'small target') and fine-grained personalized semantic descriptions derived through visual-to-textual mapping within the image space. This design not only facilitates learning fine-grained semantic information but also can inherently leverage language prompts during inference without relying on any annotation requirements. By fully leveraging the precision and conciseness of text descriptions, we further introduce a text-guide channel attention (TGCA) mechanism and text-guide spatial attention (TGSA) mechanism that enhances the model's sensitivity to potential targets across both low- and high-level feature spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves detection accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 当前基于视频的方法主要是单视角，阻碍了全面的3D几何感知，常导致几何失真或不真实的运动模式；而3D HOI方法依赖受控实验室环境的高质量3D数据，限制了在真实场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 提出两个核心创新：(1)多视角联合扩散模型共同生成HOI视频和中间运动；(2)扩散点对齐器将粗糙中间运动细化为全局对齐的4D度量点轨迹。建立2D外观与4D动力学的闭环相互增强循环。

Conclusion: SyncMV4D通过统一视觉、运动和几何信息，成功生成了高质量的多视角HOI视频和4D运动，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) generation plays a critical role in advancing applications across animation and robotics. Current video-based methods are predominantly single-view, which impedes comprehensive 3D geometry perception and often results in geometric distortions or unrealistic motion patterns. While 3D HOI approaches can generate dynamically plausible motions, their dependence on high-quality 3D data captured in controlled laboratory settings severely limits their generalization to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SyncMV4D, the first model that jointly generates synchronized multi-view HOI videos and 4D motions by unifying visual prior, motion dynamics, and multi-view geometry. Our framework features two core innovations: (1) a Multi-view Joint Diffusion (MJD) model that co-generates HOI videos and intermediate motions, and (2) a Diffusion Points Aligner (DPA) that refines the coarse intermediate motion into globally aligned 4D metric point tracks. To tightly couple 2D appearance with 4D dynamics, we establish a closed-loop, mutually enhancing cycle. During the diffusion denoising process, the generated video conditions the refinement of the 4D motion, while the aligned 4D point tracks are reprojected to guide next-step joint generation. Experimentally, our method demonstrates superior performance to state-of-the-art alternatives in visual realism, motion plausibility, and multi-view consistency.

Result: 实验表明SteadyDancer在外观保真度和运动控制方面达到最先进性能，且训练资源需求显著低于同类方法。

Conclusion: SteadyDancer是首个能够稳健确保首帧保持的框架，实现了协调一致的动画效果，在人像动画领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Preserving first-frame identity while ensuring precise motion control is a fundamental challenge in human image animation. The Image-to-Motion Binding process of the dominant Reference-to-Video (R2V) paradigm overlooks critical spatio-temporal misalignments common in real-world applications, leading to failures such as identity drift and visual artifacts. We introduce SteadyDancer, an Image-to-Video (I2V) paradigm-based framework that achieves harmonized and coherent animation and is the first to ensure first-frame preservation robustly. Firstly, we propose a Condition-Reconciliation Mechanism to harmonize the two conflicting conditions, enabling precise control without sacrificing fidelity. Secondly, we design Synergistic Pose Modulation Modules to generate an adaptive and coherent pose representation that is highly compatible with the reference image. Finally, we employ a Staged Decoupled-Objective Training Pipeline that hierarchically optimizes the model for motion fidelity, visual quality, and temporal coherence. Experiments demonstrate that SteadyDancer achieves state-of-the-art performance in both appearance fidelity and motion control, while requiring significantly fewer training resources than comparable methods.

TL;DR: MonoMSK是一个从单目视频估计生物力学真实3D人体运动的混合框架，通过结合数据驱动学习和物理模拟，同时恢复运动学和动力学参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目方法使用解剖学不准确的简化模型（如SMPL）并忽略物理原理，限制了生物力学保真度。需要开发能够同时恢复运动学和动力学的生物力学真实方法。

Method: 使用基于变压器的逆动力学与可微分前向运动学和动力学层集成，通过ODE模拟建立物理调节的逆-前向循环，强制执行生物力学因果关系和物理合理性。

Result: 在BML-MoVi、BEDLAM和OpenCap数据集上的实验表明，MonoMSK在运动学精度上显著优于最先进方法，并首次实现了精确的单目动力学估计。

Conclusion: MonoMSK成功地将数据驱动学习与物理模拟相结合，为从单目视频中估计生物力学真实的3D人体运动提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing biomechanically realistic 3D human motion - recovering both kinematics (motion) and kinetics (forces) - is a critical challenge. While marker-based systems are lab-bound and slow, popular monocular methods use oversimplified, anatomically inaccurate models (e.g., SMPL) and ignore physics, fundamentally limiting their biomechanical fidelity. In this work, we introduce MonoMSK, a hybrid framework that bridges data-driven learning and physics-based simulation for biomechanically realistic 3D human motion estimation from monocular video. MonoMSK jointly recovers both kinematics (motions) and kinetics (forces and torques) through an anatomically accurate musculoskeletal model. By integrating transformer-based inverse dynamics with differentiable forward kinematics and dynamics layers governed by ODE-based simulation, MonoMSK establishes a physics-regulated inverse-forward loop that enforces biomechanical causality and physical plausibility. A novel forward-inverse consistency loss further aligns motion reconstruction with the underlying kinetic reasoning. Experiments on BML-MoVi, BEDLAM, and OpenCap show that MonoMSK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in kinematic accuracy, while for the first time enabling precise monocular kinetics estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习遗忘方法通常只修改分类器而保留内部表示，导致不完全遗忘。本文旨在将遗忘概念扩展到表示层面，实现更彻底的遗忘。

Method: 基于神经崩溃理论，提出POUR方法：POUR-P使用封闭形式的几何投影，POUR-D在蒸馏方案下进行特征级遗忘。利用正交投影保持ETF结构，实现最优遗忘。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100和PathMNIST数据集上的实验表明，POUR在分类级和表示级指标上都优于现有最先进的遗忘方法。

Conclusion: POUR方法通过表示层面的几何投影实现了可证明最优的遗忘，同时有效保留知识，为机器学习遗忘提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In computer vision, machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific visual concepts or training images without retraining from scratch. Studies show that existing approaches often modify the classifier while leaving internal representations intact, resulting in incomplete forgetting. In this work, we extend the notion of unlearning to the representation level, deriving a three-term interplay between forgetting efficacy, retention fidelity, and class separation. Building on Neural Collapse theory, we show that the orthogonal projection of a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) remains an ETF in a lower dimensional space, yielding a provably optimal forgetting operator. We further introduce the Representation Unlearning Score (RUS) to quantify representation-level forgetting and retention fidelity. Building on this, we introduce POUR (Provably Optimal Unlearning of Representations), a geometric projection method with closed-form (POUR-P) and a feature-level unlearning variant under a distillation scheme (POUR-D). Experiments on CIFAR-10/100 and PathMNIST demonstrate that POUR achieves effective unlearning while preserving retained knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art unlearning methods on both classification-level and representation-level metrics.

TL;DR: 提出Syn-GRPO方法，通过在线数据生成器合成高质量训练数据来解决MLLM强化学习中数据质量低的问题，显著提升感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法面临数据质量低的问题，样本无法激发MLLM的多样化响应，限制了探索范围。虽然有些方法尝试通过熵约束缓解，但未能从根本上解决问题。

Method: Syn-GRPO包含数据服务器和GRPO工作流两个组件。数据服务器使用图像生成模型从现有样本合成新样本，采用解耦异步方案实现高生成效率。GRPO工作流向数据服务器提供新图像描述，并利用多样性奖励监督MLLM预测图像描述以合成多样化响应样本。

Conclusion: Syn-GRPO通过在线数据生成有效解决了MLLM强化学习中的数据质量问题，为长期自演化强化学习提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: RL (reinforcement learning) methods (e.g., GRPO) for MLLM (Multimodal LLM) perception ability has attracted wide research interest owing to its remarkable generalization ability. Nevertheless, existing reinforcement learning methods still face the problem of low data quality, where data samples cannot elicit diverse responses from MLLMs, thus restricting the exploration scope for MLLM reinforcement learning. Some methods attempt to mitigate this problem by imposing constraints on entropy, but none address it at its root. Therefore, to tackle this problem, this work proposes Syn-GRPO (Synthesis-GRPO), which employs an online data generator to synthesize high-quality training data with diverse responses in GRPO training. Specifically, Syn-GRPO consists of two components: (1) data server; (2) GRPO workflow. The data server synthesizes new samples from existing ones using an image generation model, featuring a decoupled and asynchronous scheme to achieve high generation efficiency. The GRPO workflow provides the data server with the new image descriptions, and it leverages a diversity reward to supervise the MLLM to predict image descriptions for synthesizing samples with diverse responses. Experiment results across three visual perception tasks demonstrate that Syn-GRPO improves the data quality by a large margin, achieving significant superior performance to existing MLLM perception methods, and Syn-GRPO presents promising potential for scaling long-term self-evolving RL.

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模细胞计数数据集（3,023张图像，超过430,000个标注细胞位置），并评估了多种细胞计数方法，包括基于SAM的SAM-Counter方法，在挑战性数据集上取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细胞计数在生物医学研究和临床应用中至关重要，但现有数据集规模有限（通常少于500张图像），且手动标注耗时费力，需要开发更可靠的自动化方法。

Method: 创建大规模免疫细胞化学数据集，评估回归方法、人群计数方法和细胞计数方法，并基于Segment Anything Model（SAM）开发了SAM-Counter密度图方法。

Result: SAM-Counter方法在测试集上取得了22.12的平均绝对误差（MAE），优于现有最佳方法的27.46 MAE，测试集细胞计数范围为10-2,126个细胞/图像。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准框架对推动自动化细胞计数进展具有重要价值，为未来研究提供了坚实基础，SAM方法在细胞计数任务中展现出良好潜力。

Abstract: Accurate cell counting is essential in various biomedical research and clinical applications, including cancer diagnosis, stem cell research, and immunology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, motivating automation through deep learning techniques. However, training reliable deep learning models requires large amounts of high-quality annotated data, which is difficult and time-consuming to produce manually. Consequently, existing cell-counting datasets are often limited, frequently containing fewer than $500$ images. In this work, we introduce a large-scale annotated dataset comprising $3{,}023$ images from immunocytochemistry experiments related to cellular differentiation, containing over $430{,}000$ manually annotated cell locations. The dataset presents significant challenges: high cell density, overlapping and morphologically diverse cells, a long-tailed distribution of cell count per image, and variation in staining protocols. We benchmark three categories of existing methods: regression-based, crowd-counting, and cell-counting techniques on a test set with cell counts ranging from $10$ to $2{,}126$ cells per image. We also evaluate how the Segment Anything Model (SAM) can be adapted for microscopy cell counting using only dot-annotated datasets. As a case study, we implement a density-map-based adaptation of SAM (SAM-Counter) and report a mean absolute error (MAE) of $22.12$, which outperforms existing approaches (second-best MAE of $27.46$). Our results underscore the value of the dataset and the benchmarking framework for driving progress in automated cell counting and provide a robust foundation for future research and development.

TL;DR: 提出了Self-Paced GRPO方法，通过动态调整奖励模型来改善视频生成模型的强化学习对齐效果，解决了静态奖励模型带来的分布偏差和饱和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法依赖静态、固定容量的奖励模型，这些模型在训练期间评估行为被冻结，导致分布偏差、随着生成器改进而快速饱和，限制了强化学习对齐的稳定性和有效性。

Method: 提出了Self-Paced GRPO框架，引入渐进式奖励机制，随着生成质量提高自动将奖励重点从粗粒度视觉保真度转移到时间一致性和细粒度文本-视频语义对齐。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中，多个视频生成骨干网络上的实验表明，相比使用静态奖励的GRPO基线，Self-Paced GRPO在视觉质量和语义对齐方面都取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: Self-Paced GRPO通过奖励反馈与生成器共同演化的方法，缓解了奖励-策略不匹配问题，减轻了奖励利用，实现了更稳定的优化，验证了该方法的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a powerful reinforcement learning paradigm for post-training video generation models. However, existing GRPO pipelines rely on static, fixed-capacity reward models whose evaluation behavior is frozen during training. Such rigid rewards introduce distributional bias, saturate quickly as the generator improves, and ultimately limit the stability and effectiveness of reinforcement-based alignment. We propose Self-Paced GRPO, a competence-aware GRPO framework in which reward feedback co-evolves with the generator. Our method introduces a progressive reward mechanism that automatically shifts its emphasis from coarse visual fidelity to temporal coherence and fine-grained text-video semantic alignment as generation quality increases. This self-paced curriculum alleviates reward-policy mismatch, mitigates reward exploitation, and yields more stable optimization. Experiments on VBench across multiple video generation backbones demonstrate consistent improvements in both visual quality and semantic alignment over GRPO baselines with static rewards, validating the effectiveness and generality of Self-Paced GRPO.

Motivation: 企业软件拥有数千个UI界面，现有方法依赖视觉相似性或文本语义，缺乏对UI组成结构特性的显式建模，难以保证设计一致性、模式发现和合规检查。

Method: 将UI截图转换为属性图表示层次关系和空间布局，使用对比图自编码器学习嵌入，保留视觉、结构和语义属性的多级相似性。

Result: 在20,396个金融软件UI上，UISearch框架达到0.92的Top-5准确率，中位延迟47.5ms，可扩展到20,000+个界面，结构嵌入比最先进视觉编码器具有更好的区分能力。

Conclusion: 结构嵌入在UI表示表达能力上实现了根本性进步，混合索引架构支持复杂查询和细粒度UI区分，这是纯视觉方法无法实现的。

Abstract: Enterprise software companies maintain thousands of user interface screens across products and versions, creating critical challenges for design consistency, pattern discovery, and compliance check. Existing approaches rely on visual similarity or text semantics, lacking explicit modeling of structural properties fundamental to user interface (UI) composition. We present a novel graph-based representation that converts UI screenshots into attributed graphs encoding hierarchical relationships and spatial arrangements, potentially generalizable to document layouts, architectural diagrams, and other structured visual domains. A contrastive graph autoencoder learns embeddings preserving multi-level similarity across visual, structural, and semantic properties. The comprehensive analysis demonstrates that our structural embeddings achieve better discriminative power than state-of-the-art Vision Encoders, representing a fundamental advance in the expressiveness of the UI representation. We implement this representation in UISearch, a multi-modal search framework that combines structural embeddings with semantic search through a composable query language. On 20,396 financial software UIs, UISearch achieves 0.92 Top-5 accuracy with 47.5ms median latency (P95: 124ms), scaling to 20,000+ screens. The hybrid indexing architecture enables complex queries and supports fine-grained UI distinction impossible with vision-only approaches.

Motivation: 传统病灶分割将所有非病灶像素简单归为单一"背景"类，忽略了丰富的解剖学背景信息。背景实际上是高度异质的，包含组织、器官等结构

Method: 提出BackSplit方法，使用细粒度标签细分背景类，通过增加Fisher信息来获得更紧的渐近边界和更稳定的优化

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上的实验表明，BackSplit能持续提升小病灶分割性能，即使辅助标签是通过预训练分割模型自动生成的也有效

Conclusion: BackSplit是一种简单而强大的范式，通过细分背景类来利用解剖学上下文信息，显著提升小病灶分割性能，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Abstract: Segmenting small lesions in medical images remains notoriously difficult. Most prior work tackles this challenge by either designing better architectures, loss functions, or data augmentation schemes; and collecting more labeled data. We take a different view, arguing that part of the problem lies in how the background is modeled. Common lesion segmentation collapses all non-lesion pixels into a single "background" class, ignoring the rich anatomical context in which lesions appear. In reality, the background is highly heterogeneous-composed of tissues, organs, and other structures that can now be labeled manually or inferred automatically using existing segmentation models.
  In this paper, we argue that training with fine-grained labels that sub-divide the background class, which we call BackSplit, is a simple yet powerful paradigm that can offer a significant performance boost without increasing inference costs. From an information theoretic standpoint, we prove that BackSplit increases the expected Fisher Information relative to conventional binary training, leading to tighter asymptotic bounds and more stable optimization. With extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures, we empirically show that BackSplit consistently boosts small-lesion segmentation performance, even when auxiliary labels are generated automatically using pretrained segmentation models. Additionally, we demonstrate that auxiliary labels derived from interactive segmentation frameworks exhibit the same beneficial effect, demonstrating its robustness, simplicity, and broad applicability.

Conclusion: SAM3-Adapter可以作为未来研究和实际分割应用的基础，提供了卓越的准确性、鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid rise of large-scale foundation models has reshaped the landscape of image segmentation, with models such as Segment Anything achieving unprecedented versatility across diverse vision tasks. However, previous generations-including SAM and its successor-still struggle with fine-grained, low-level segmentation challenges such as camouflaged object detection, medical image segmentation, cell image segmentation, and shadow detection. To address these limitations, we originally proposed SAM-Adapter in 2023, demonstrating substantial gains on these difficult scenarios. With the emergence of Segment Anything 3 (SAM3)-a more efficient and higher-performing evolution with a redesigned architecture and improved training pipeline-we revisit these long-standing challenges. In this work, we present SAM3-Adapter, the first adapter framework tailored for SAM3 that unlocks its full segmentation capability. SAM3-Adapter not only reduces computational overhead but also consistently surpasses both SAM and SAM2-based solutions, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple downstream tasks, including medical imaging, camouflaged (concealed) object segmentation, and shadow detection. Built upon the modular and composable design philosophy of the original SAM-Adapter, SAM3-Adapter provides stronger generalizability, richer task adaptability, and significantly improved segmentation precision. Extensive experiments confirm that integrating SAM3 with our adapter yields superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared to all prior SAM-based adaptations. We hope SAM3-Adapter can serve as a foundation for future research and practical segmentation applications. Code, pre-trained models, and data processing pipelines are available.

Abstract: SAM3D has garnered widespread attention for its strong 3D object reconstruction capabilities. However, a key limitation remains: SAM3D cannot reconstruct specific objects referred to by textual descriptions, a capability that is essential for practical applications such as 3D editing, game development, and virtual environments. To address this gap, we introduce Ref-SAM3D, a simple yet effective extension to SAM3D that incorporates textual descriptions as a high-level prior, enabling text-guided 3D reconstruction from a single RGB image. Through extensive qualitative experiments, we show that Ref-SAM3D, guided only by natural language and a single 2D view, delivers competitive and high-fidelity zero-shot reconstruction performance. Our results demonstrate that Ref-SAM3D effectively bridges the gap between 2D visual cues and 3D geometric understanding, offering a more flexible and accessible paradigm for reference-guided 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Task scheduling is critical for embodied AI, enabling agents to follow natural language instructions and execute actions efficiently in 3D physical worlds. However, existing datasets often simplify task planning by ignoring operations research (OR) knowledge and 3D spatial grounding. In this work, we propose Operations Research knowledge-based 3D Grounded Task Scheduling (ORS3D), a new task that requires the synergy of language understanding, 3D grounding, and efficiency optimization. Unlike prior settings, ORS3D demands that agents minimize total completion time by leveraging parallelizable subtasks, e.g., cleaning the sink while the microwave operates. To facilitate research on ORS3D, we construct ORS3D-60K, a large-scale dataset comprising 60K composite tasks across 4K real-world scenes. Furthermore, we propose GRANT, an embodied multi-modal large language model equipped with a simple yet effective scheduling token mechanism to generate efficient task schedules and grounded actions. Extensive experiments on ORS3D-60K validate the effectiveness of GRANT across language understanding, 3D grounding, and scheduling efficiency.

Motivation: 当前全球模型在千米尺度运行，难以模拟单个云层和极端降水、阵风、湍流、地表辐照度等因素，需要更高分辨率模型，而这又需要高分辨率真实观测数据。

Method: 利用同形引导的2D到3D变换器，仅使用同步地面相机重建4维云状态，通过追踪3D液态水含量随时间变化来估计水平风矢量。

Result: 在包含六个向上拍摄相机的两个月部署中，系统相比最先进的卫星测量提供了数量级的时空分辨率改进，同时相对于共置雷达测量保持个位数相对误差（<10%）。

Conclusion: Cloud4D框架能够以高时空分辨率重建物理一致的4维云状态，为高分辨率天气和气候建模提供了重要工具。

Abstract: There has been great progress in improving numerical weather prediction and climate models using machine learning. However, most global models act at a kilometer-scale, making it challenging to model individual clouds and factors such as extreme precipitation, wind gusts, turbulence, and surface irradiance. Therefore, there is a need to move towards higher-resolution models, which in turn require high-resolution real-world observations that current instruments struggle to obtain. We present Cloud4D, the first learning-based framework that reconstructs a physically consistent, four-dimensional cloud state using only synchronized ground-based cameras. Leveraging a homography-guided 2D-to-3D transformer, Cloud4D infers the full 3D distribution of liquid water content at 25 m spatial and 5 s temporal resolution. By tracking the 3D liquid water content retrievals over time, Cloud4D additionally estimates horizontal wind vectors. Across a two-month deployment comprising six skyward cameras, our system delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in space-time resolution relative to state-of-the-art satellite measurements, while retaining single-digit relative error ($<10\%$) against collocated radar measurements.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单的即插即用采样方法，通过在去噪轨迹中切换两个预训练扩散专家来打破图像质量与数据似然之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中存在感知样本质量与数据似然之间的权衡：强调高噪声去噪步骤的训练目标产生真实图像但似然差，而似然导向的训练过度加权低噪声步骤并损害视觉保真度。

Method: 在去噪轨迹中切换两个预训练扩散专家：在高噪声水平应用图像质量专家塑造全局结构，然后在低噪声水平切换到似然专家细化像素统计。无需重新训练或微调，只需选择中间切换步骤。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet32上，合并模型始终匹配或优于其基础组件，相对于每个单独专家，改善或保持了似然和样本质量。

Conclusion: 跨噪声水平的专家切换是打破图像扩散模型中似然-质量权衡的有效方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models for image generation often exhibit a trade-off between perceptual sample quality and data likelihood: training objectives emphasizing high-noise denoising steps yield realistic images but poor likelihoods, whereas likelihood-oriented training overweights low-noise steps and harms visual fidelity. We introduce a simple plug-and-play sampling method that combines two pretrained diffusion experts by switching between them along the denoising trajectory. Specifically, we apply an image-quality expert at high noise levels to shape global structure, then switch to a likelihood expert at low noise levels to refine pixel statistics. The approach requires no retraining or fine-tuning -- only the choice of an intermediate switching step. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet32, the merged model consistently matches or outperforms its base components, improving or preserving both likelihood and sample quality relative to each expert alone. These results demonstrate that expert switching across noise levels is an effective way to break the likelihood-quality trade-off in image diffusion models.

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，IF-Edit在推理中心任务上表现强劲，同时在通用编辑任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究为视频扩散模型作为图像编辑器提供了系统视角，并突出了统一视频-图像生成推理的简单方法。

Abstract: Large-scale video diffusion models show strong world simulation and temporal reasoning abilities, but their use as zero-shot image editors remains underexplored. We introduce IF-Edit, a tuning-free framework that repurposes pretrained image-to-video diffusion models for instruction-driven image editing. IF-Edit addresses three key challenges: prompt misalignment, redundant temporal latents, and blurry late-stage frames. It includes (1) a chain-of-thought prompt enhancement module that transforms static editing instructions into temporally grounded reasoning prompts; (2) a temporal latent dropout strategy that compresses frame latents after the expert-switch point, accelerating denoising while preserving semantic and temporal coherence; and (3) a self-consistent post-refinement step that sharpens late-stage frames using a short still-video trajectory. Experiments on four public benchmarks, covering non-rigid editing, physical and temporal reasoning, and general instruction edits, show that IF-Edit performs strongly on reasoning-centric tasks while remaining competitive on general-purpose edits. Our study provides a systematic view of video diffusion models as image editors and highlights a simple recipe for unified video-image generative reasoning.

TL;DR: LumiTex是一个端到端的PBR纹理生成框架，通过多分支生成方案、光照感知材料注意力机制和几何引导修复模块，解决了材料分解和纹理补全的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PBR纹理生成方法无法解决两个基本挑战：1）在有限光照线索下从图像提示进行材料分解；2）无缝且视角一致的纹理补全。

Method: 包含三个关键组件：1）多分支生成方案，在共享光照先验下解耦反照率和金属粗糙度；2）光照感知材料注意力机制，将光照上下文注入解码过程；3）基于大视角合成模型的几何引导修复模块，确保无缝UV补全。

Result: 大量实验表明LumiTex在纹理质量方面达到最先进性能，超越了现有开源和商业方法。

Conclusion: LumiTex通过创新的多组件设计成功解决了PBR纹理生成中的材料分解和纹理补全问题，实现了高质量的物理渲染纹理生成。

Abstract: Physically-based rendering (PBR) provides a principled standard for realistic material-lighting interactions in computer graphics. Despite recent advances in generating PBR textures, existing methods fail to address two fundamental challenges: 1) materials decomposition from image prompts under limited illumination cues, and 2) seamless and view-consistent texture completion. To this end, we propose LumiTex, an end-to-end framework that comprises three key components: (1) a multi-branch generation scheme that disentangles albedo and metallic-roughness under shared illumination priors for robust material understanding, (2) a lighting-aware material attention mechanism that injects illumination context into the decoding process for physically grounded generation of albedo, metallic, and roughness maps, and (3) a geometry-guided inpainting module based on a large view synthesis model that enriches texture coverage and ensures seamless, view-consistent UV completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LumiTex achieves state-of-the-art performance in texture quality, surpassing both existing open-source and commercial methods.

### [321] [SCARE: A Benchmark for SQL Correction and Question Answerability Classification for Reliable EHR Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17559)
*Gyubok Lee,Woosog Chay,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SCARE是一个用于评估电子健康记录问答系统中后验安全机制的基准，包含4200个问题-SQL对，用于评估问题可回答性分类和SQL查询验证/修正的联合任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床环境中部署文本到SQL模型存在安全风险，错误SQL查询可能危及患者护理，但缺乏统一基准来评估后验验证机制。

Method: 构建包含4200个三元组（问题、候选SQL查询、预期输出）的基准，基于MIMIC-III、MIMIC-IV和eICU数据库，涵盖7种不同文本到SQL模型生成的多样化问题。

Result: 实验揭示了问题分类和SQL错误修正之间的关键权衡，突出了主要挑战。

Conclusion: SCARE基准填补了后验安全机制评估的空白，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of text-to-SQL models that allow clinicians to query structured data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using natural language. However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between question classification and SQL error correction, highlighting key challenges and outlining directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs处理长上下文时解码延迟和内存开销大，现有KV缓存重用方法存在性能下降问题

Method: A³算法预计算文本块的KV缓存，根据与问题的相关性选择性融合，实现准确集成和最小计算开销

Result: 在多个基准测试和LLMs上，A³相比四个基线方法获得最佳任务性能，同时将首词生成时间减少2倍

Conclusion: A³算法有效解决了长上下文处理中的延迟问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升效率

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in processing long contexts, enabling them to tackle tasks involving long textual inputs such as multi-turn conversations, legal documents, or retrieved documents in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, despite their ability to handle long sequences, the resulting decoding latency and memory overhead remain substantial, posing challenges for real-world deployment. Recent advances in KV Cache reuse have shown potential to mitigate these costs, but still suffer from notable performance degradation. To address this issue, we conduct an in-depth investigation of recomputation-based reuse methods and observe that the recomputed tokens often fail to align with the context segments most relevant to the question. This misalignment hinders proper updates to the critical contextual representations. Therefore, we propose the $\textbf{A}$ttention-$\textbf{A}$ware $\textbf{A}$ccurate KV Cache Fusion algorithm ($A^3$), which precomputes and selectively fuses the KV Cache of text chunks based on their relevance to the question, achieving accurate integration with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and LLMs demonstrate that $A^3$ achieves the best task performance compared to four baselines while reducing the time-to-first-token (TTFT) by 2$\times$.

Method: 基于形式化规则语法将复杂指令解构为<过程、关系、值>三元组，通过多阶段人工参与流程生成多样化数据集，并使用透明程序化引擎进行客观验证。

Result: 开发了LexInstructEval基准测试框架，包含数据集和开源评估工具，支持对LLM可控性和可靠性的进一步研究。

Conclusion: LexInstructEval为解决LLM细粒度词汇指令遵循评估的挑战提供了系统化、客观的解决方案，推动了LLM可控性和可靠性研究的发展。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to precisely follow complex and fine-grained lexical instructions is a cornerstone of their utility and controllability. However, evaluating this capability remains a significant challenge. Current methods either rely on subjective and costly human evaluation or on automated LLM-as-a-judge systems, which suffer from inherent biases and unreliability. Existing programmatic benchmarks, while objective, often lack the expressiveness to test intricate, compositional constraints at a granular level. To address these limitations, we introduce LexInstructEval, a new benchmark and evaluation framework for fine-grained lexical instruction following. Our framework is built upon a formal, rule-based grammar that deconstructs complex instructions into a canonical <Procedure, Relation, Value> triplet. This grammar enables the systematic generation of a diverse dataset through a multi-stage, human-in-the-loop pipeline and facilitates objective verification via a transparent, programmatic engine. We release our dataset and open-source evaluation tools to facilitate further research into the controllability and reliability of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\ourmethod{}的生成式缓存方法，能够为结构相似的提示生成变体感知的响应，显著提高缓存命中率和执行效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可重复工作流和智能体场景中，提示经常被重复使用且只有微小变化，但精确匹配会失败，语义缓存可能忽略关键差异产生错误响应。

Method: \ourmethod{}识别相似提示结构中的可重用响应模式，并为新请求合成定制化输出。

Result: 在无提示重复的数据集上达到83%的缓存命中率且错误命中率最小；在智能体工作流中，相比标准提示匹配，缓存命中率提高约20%，端到端执行延迟降低约34%。

Conclusion: \ourmethod{}能够有效处理结构相似提示的缓存问题，显著提升LLM在重复性任务中的执行效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to plan, reason, and execute tasks across diverse scenarios. In use cases like repeatable workflows and agentic settings, prompts are often reused with minor variations while having a similar structure for recurring tasks. This opens up opportunities for caching. However, exact prompt matching fails on such structurally similar prompts, while semantic caching may produce incorrect responses by ignoring critical differences. To address this, we introduce \ourmethod{}, a generative cache that produces variation-aware responses for structurally similar prompts. \ourmethod{} identifies reusable response patterns across similar prompt structures and synthesizes customized outputs for new requests. We show that \ourmethod{} achieves 83\% cache hit rate, while having minimal incorrect hits on datasets without prompt repetition. In agentic workflows, it improves cache hit rate by $\sim$20\% and reduces end-to-end execution latency by $\sim$34\% compared to standard prompt matching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个测试认知立场转移的框架，通过删除事件知识来验证对齐LLMs是否能在无知状态下仍保持特定社区的行为模式，发现即使移除事实信息，LLMs仍能维持社区特定的不确定性处理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在对齐到特定在线社区时，是表现出可泛化的行为模式反映社区态度，还是仅仅回忆训练数据中的模式。

Method: 引入认知立场转移测试框架：定向删除事件知识并用多种探针验证，然后评估模型在无知状态下是否仍能重现社区的有机响应模式。使用俄罗斯-乌克兰军事讨论和美国党派Twitter数据进行实验。

Result: 即使经过激进的事实移除，对齐的LLMs仍保持稳定的、社区特定的不确定性处理行为模式。

Conclusion: 对齐编码了结构化的、可泛化的行为，超越了表面模仿。该框架为检测在无知状态下持续存在的行为偏见提供了系统方法，推动了更安全透明的LLM部署。

Abstract: When large language models (LLMs) are aligned to a specific online community, do they exhibit generalizable behavioral patterns that mirror that community's attitudes and responses to new uncertainty, or are they simply recalling patterns from training data? We introduce a framework to test epistemic stance transfer: targeted deletion of event knowledge, validated with multiple probes, followed by evaluation of whether models still reproduce the community's organic response patterns under ignorance. Using Russian--Ukrainian military discourse and U.S. partisan Twitter data, we find that even after aggressive fact removal, aligned LLMs maintain stable, community-specific behavioral patterns for handling uncertainty. These results provide evidence that alignment encodes structured, generalizable behaviors beyond surface mimicry. Our framework offers a systematic way to detect behavioral biases that persist under ignorance, advancing efforts toward safer and more transparent LLM deployments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个完全非语言学的文本模型，仅基于有限字母表和空格符号的独立随机抽取，推导出词汇长度分布、词汇增长、临界长度和Zipf型秩频定律等结构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自然语言和大语言模型中的词汇统计提供一个结构化的零模型，证明Zipf型模式可以纯粹从组合学和分割中产生，无需优化原则或语言组织。

Method: 使用有限字母表加空格符号的独立随机抽取模型，将词汇定义为最大非空格符号块，基于几何分布和优惠券收集者论证进行数学推导。

Result: 词汇长度服从几何分布；词汇数量和不同词汇数量的期望有闭式解；存在临界词汇长度k*；推导出Zipf型秩频定律p(r) ∝ r^{-α}，指数由字母表大小和空格概率决定。

Conclusion: 该模型为语言统计提供了结构化的零模型，表明Zipf型模式可能源于随机文本结构，而非深层语言机制，有助于识别需要更深层解释的语言现象。

Abstract: We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.
  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.

Conclusion: 支持方法论多元主义，提出计算框架分析的路线图，建议研究人员利用这些方法的互补性进行组合使用。

Abstract: Computational approaches have previously shown various promises and pitfalls when it comes to the reliable identification of media frames. Generative LLMs like GPT and Claude are increasingly being used as content analytical tools, but how effective are they for frame analysis? We address this question by systematically evaluating them against their computational predecessors: bag-of-words models and encoder-only transformers; and traditional manual coding procedures. Our analysis rests on a novel gold standard dataset that we inductively and iteratively developed through the study, investigating six months of news coverage of the US Mpox epidemic of 2022. While we discover some potential applications for generative LLMs, we demonstrate that they were consistently outperformed by manual coders, and in some instances, by smaller language models. Some form of human validation was always necessary to determine appropriate model choice. Additionally, by examining how the suitability of various approaches depended on the nature of different tasks that were part of our frame analytical workflow, we provide insights as to how researchers may leverage the complementarity of these approaches to use them in tandem. We conclude by endorsing a methodologically pluralistic approach and put forth a roadmap for computational frame analysis for researchers going forward.

Motivation: 大型语言模型可以模拟多方审议，但由于缺乏说话者归属数据，现实建模受到限制。自动语音识别生成的匿名说话者标签无法捕捉一致的人类行为。

Method: 开发了一个可复现的流程，将公共Zoom录音转换为带有说话者身份、人物画像和语用行为标签（如[propose_motion]）的转录文本。发布了三个地方政府审议数据集，并使用这些"行为感知"数据微调LLM来建模特定参与者。

Result: 使用该数据微调的LLM在困惑度上降低了67%，在说话者保真度和真实性的分类器性能指标上几乎翻倍。图灵式人工评估显示，模拟结果通常与真实审议难以区分。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂现实公民模拟提供了一种实用且可扩展的方法，能够生成高度逼真的多方审议模拟。

Abstract: Large language models offer opportunities to simulate multi-party deliberation, but realistic modeling remains limited by a lack of speaker-attributed data. Transcripts produced via automatic speech recognition (ASR) assign anonymous speaker labels (e.g., Speaker_1), preventing models from capturing consistent human behavior. This work introduces a reproducible pipeline to transform public Zoom recordings into speaker-attributed transcripts with metadata like persona profiles and pragmatic action tags (e.g., [propose_motion]). We release three local government deliberation datasets: Appellate Court hearings, School Board meetings, and Municipal Council sessions. Fine-tuning LLMs to model specific participants using this "action-aware" data produces a 67% reduction in perplexity and nearly doubles classifier-based performance metrics for speaker fidelity and realism. Turing-style human evaluations show our simulations are often indistinguishable from real deliberations, providing a practical and scalable method for complex realistic civic simulations.

Abstract: The capacity for highly complex, evidence-based, and strategically adaptive persuasion remains a formidable great challenge for artificial intelligence. Previous work, like IBM Project Debater, focused on generating persuasive speeches in simplified and shortened debate formats intended for relatively lay audiences. We introduce DeepDebater, a novel autonomous system capable of participating in and winning a full, unmodified, two-team competitive policy debate. Our system employs a hierarchical architecture of specialized multi-agent workflows, where teams of LLM-powered agents collaborate and critique one another to perform discrete argumentative tasks. Each workflow utilizes iterative retrieval, synthesis, and self-correction using a massive corpus of policy debate evidence (OpenDebateEvidence) and produces complete speech transcripts, cross-examinations, and rebuttals. We introduce a live, interactive end-to-end presentation pipeline that renders debates with AI speech and animation: transcripts are surface-realized and synthesized to audio with OpenAI TTS, and then displayed as talking-head portrait videos with EchoMimic V1. Beyond fully autonomous matches (AI vs AI), DeepDebater supports hybrid human-AI operation: human debaters can intervene at any stage, and humans can optionally serve as opponents against AI in any speech, allowing AI-human and AI-AI rounds. In preliminary evaluations against human-authored cases, DeepDebater produces qualitatively superior argumentative components and consistently wins simulated rounds as adjudicated by an independent autonomous judge. Expert human debate coaches also prefer the arguments, evidence, and cases constructed by DeepDebater. We open source all code, generated speech transcripts, audio and talking head video here: https://github.com/Hellisotherpeople/DeepDebater/tree/main

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于保形预测的覆盖控制过滤框架，用于在检索增强生成(RAG)中去除不相关内容，同时保持支持证据的召回率。该方法能减少2-3倍的保留上下文，并在严格过滤下提高下游事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预生成过滤器依赖启发式方法或未校准的LLM置信度分数，无法对保留证据提供统计控制。当长或嘈杂的上下文超过模型有效注意力范围时，LLM准确性会下降。

Method: 使用保形预测框架，通过嵌入和LLM评分函数评估上下文相关性，在NeuCLIR和RAGTIME数据集上进行测试，实现覆盖控制的过滤。

Result: 保形过滤始终达到目标覆盖范围，确保保留指定比例的相关片段，将保留上下文减少2-3倍。在NeuCLIR上，严格过滤下ARGUE F1测量的事实准确性得到改善。

Conclusion: 保形预测为RAG中的上下文工程提供了可靠、覆盖控制的上下文缩减方法，提供了模型无关的原则性方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances factual grounding in large language models (LLMs) by incorporating retrieved evidence, but LLM accuracy declines when long or noisy contexts exceed the model's effective attention span. Existing pre-generation filters rely on heuristics or uncalibrated LLM confidence scores, offering no statistical control over retained evidence. We evaluate and demonstrate context engineering through conformal prediction, a coverage-controlled filtering framework that removes irrelevant content while preserving recall of supporting evidence. Using both embedding- and LLM-based scoring functions, we test this approach on the NeuCLIR and RAGTIME collections. Conformal filtering consistently meets its target coverage, ensuring that a specified fraction of relevant snippets are retained, and reduces retained context by 2-3x relative to unfiltered retrieval. On NeuCLIR, downstream factual accuracy measured by ARGUE F1 improves under strict filtering and remains stable at moderate coverage, indicating that most discarded material is redundant or irrelevant. These results demonstrate that conformal prediction enables reliable, coverage-controlled context reduction in RAG, offering a model-agnostic and principled approach to context engineering.

Conclusion: 基于潜在表示相似性的训练free方法能有效提升VLMs的推理能力，为模型间能力迁移提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has significantly enhanced the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still struggle with multi-step reasoning tasks due to limited multimodal reasoning data. To bridge this gap, researchers have explored methods to transfer CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. However, existing approaches either need high training costs or require architectural alignment. In this paper, we use Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) to empirically show that LLMs and VLMs share similar low-frequency latent representations of CoT reasoning despite architectural differences. Based on this insight, we propose L2V-CoT, a novel training-free latent intervention approach that transfers CoT reasoning from LLMs to VLMs. L2V-CoT extracts and resamples low-frequency CoT representations from LLMs in the frequency domain, enabling dimension matching and latent injection into VLMs during inference to enhance reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms training-free baselines and even surpasses supervised methods.

TL;DR: 提出ELLA框架，通过LLM感知的关系分词器和跳级关系图Transformer，在异构图中高效捕获复杂关系语义并降低计算复杂度，同时在预训练和微调任务间使用细粒度任务感知的文本Chain-of-Thought提示来弥合语义鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构图中节点和关系类型的多样性导致复杂丰富的语义，但现有方法受限于预定义的语义依赖性和监督信号的稀缺性。预训练-微调范式虽然提供自监督信号，但会引入任务间的语义鸿沟。LLMs有潜力通过文本模态的强推理能力解决异构图中的关系和任务语义问题，但受计算复杂度限制。

Method: 1. LLM感知的关系分词器：利用LLM编码多跳、多类型关系；2. 跳级关系图Transformer：将LLM感知的关系推理复杂度从指数级降低到线性级；3. 细粒度任务感知的文本Chain-of-Thought提示：弥合预训练和微调任务间的语义鸿沟。

Result: 在四个异构图上的广泛实验表明，ELLA在性能和效率上均优于最先进方法。特别是，ELLA可扩展到130亿参数的LLMs，与现有基于LLM的方法相比实现了高达4倍的加速。

Conclusion: ELLA框架成功解决了异构图中复杂关系语义建模的计算复杂度和语义鸿沟问题，为LLMs在异构图分析中的高效应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Heterogeneous graphs are widely present in real-world complex networks, where the diversity of node and relation types leads to complex and rich semantics. Efforts for modeling complex relation semantics in heterogeneous graphs are restricted by the limitations of predefined semantic dependencies and the scarcity of supervised signals. The advanced pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm leverages graph structure to provide rich self-supervised signals, but introduces semantic gaps between tasks. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer significant potential to address the semantic issues of relations and tasks in heterogeneous graphs through their strong reasoning capabilities in textual modality, but their incorporation into heterogeneous graphs is largely limited by computational complexity. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an Efficient LLM-Aware (ELLA) framework for heterogeneous graphs, addressing the above issues. To capture complex relation semantics, we propose an LLM-aware Relation Tokenizer that leverages LLM to encode multi-hop, multi-type relations. To reduce computational complexity, we further employ a Hop-level Relation Graph Transformer, which help reduces the complexity of LLM-aware relation reasoning from exponential to linear. To bridge semantic gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, we introduce the fine-grained task-aware textual Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompts. Extensive experiments on four heterogeneous graphs show that our proposed ELLA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the performance and efficiency. In particular, ELLA scales up to 13b-parameter LLMs and achieves up to a 4x speedup compared with existing LLM-based methods. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/l-wd/ELLA.

TL;DR: SPINE是一种令牌选择性的测试时强化学习框架，通过仅更新高熵分支点令牌来避免多数投票奖励主导导致的响应缩短和性能下降问题，在多个基准测试中稳定提升推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时强化学习方法存在分布偏移和缺乏可验证监督的问题，多数投票奖励主导会导致响应缩短和Pass@1下降。

Method: 提出SPINE框架：(i)仅更新分支令牌（高熵分支点）(ii)在分支令牌处应用熵带正则化器来维持探索并抑制噪声监督。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，SPINE持续改进Pass@1，避免响应长度崩溃，并在LLM和MLLM骨干网络上产生更稳定的训练动态。

Conclusion: 将更新与思维链分支点对齐是一种简单且无需标签的机制，可在推理模型中实现稳定有效的测试时适应。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) excel at chain-of-thought reasoning but face distribution shift at test-time and a lack of verifiable supervision. Recent test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) methods derive label-free pseudo-rewards from self-consistency voting over sampled trajectories, yet they often collapse: the majority-vote reward prevails, responses shorten, and Pass@1 declines. We trace this to uniform sequence updates in which most tokens are low-entropy followers, while a small high-entropy subset determines the reasoning branches. Thus we propose SPINE, a token-selective test-time reinforcement learning framework that (i) updates only forking tokens, the high-entropy branch points identified from forward-pass statistics, and (ii) applies an entropy-band regularizer at those tokens to sustain exploration when entropy is too low and to suppress noisy supervision when it is too high. SPINE plugs into GRPO-style objectives, optionally with a KL anchor, and requires no labels or reward models. Across ten benchmarks spanning multimodal VQA, general and expert QA, mathematical reasoning, and medical QA, SPINE consistently improves Pass@1 over TTRL while avoiding response-length collapse and yielding more stable training dynamics on both LLM and MLLM backbones. These results indicate that aligning updates with chain-of-thought branch points is a simple and label-free mechanism for stable and effective test-time adaptation in reasoning models.

Motivation: 现有研究主要使用模型内部信号（如词元级熵或生成一致性）检测幻觉，但预训练数据暴露与幻觉之间的联系研究不足。作者希望探索问题或生成答案的词汇训练数据覆盖度是否能提供额外的幻觉检测信号。

Method: 在RedPajama的1.3万亿词元预训练语料上构建可扩展后缀数组，检索提示和模型生成的n-gram统计信息，并在三个QA基准上评估其对幻觉检测的有效性。

Result: 基于出现次数的特征单独使用时预测能力较弱，但与对数概率结合时能带来适度提升，特别是在内在模型不确定性较高的数据集上。

Conclusion: 词汇覆盖特征为幻觉检测提供了补充信号，特别是在模型不确定性较高的情况下能提升检测性能。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental challenge, particularly in open-domain question answering. Prior work attempts to detect hallucination with model-internal signals such as token-level entropy or generation consistency, while the connection between pretraining data exposure and hallucination is underexplored. Existing studies show that LLMs underperform on long-tail knowledge, i.e., the accuracy of the generated answer drops for the ground-truth entities that are rare in pretraining. However, examining whether data coverage itself can serve as a detection signal is overlooked. We propose a complementary question: Does lexical training-data coverage of the question and/or generated answer provide additional signal for hallucination detection? To investigate this, we construct scalable suffix arrays over RedPajama's 1.3-trillion-token pretraining corpus to retrieve $n$-gram statistics for both prompts and model generations. We evaluate their effectiveness for hallucination detection across three QA benchmarks. Our observations show that while occurrence-based features are weak predictors when used alone, they yield modest gains when combined with log-probabilities, particularly on datasets with higher intrinsic model uncertainty. These findings suggest that lexical coverage features provide a complementary signal for hallucination detection.

The study also addressed the challenges of comparing comment-based and song-based emotions, mitigating biases inherent in user-generated content. A number of Machine learning and deep learning models were pre-trained on a related large data set of Sinhala News comments in order to report the zero-shot result of our Sinhala YouTube comment data set. An optimized Multi-Layer Perceptron model, after extensive hyperparameter tuning, achieved a ROC-AUC score of 0.887. The model is a three-layer MLP with a configuration of 256, 128, and 64 neurons. This research contributes a valuable annotated dataset and provides insights for future work in Sinhala Natural Language Processing and music emotion recognition.

TL;DR: 本文发现LLM中的概念归纳头和词符归纳头可以识别出具有连贯语义结构的激活子空间，通过注意力权重变换隐藏状态能显著提升平行四边形算术和最近邻检索的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了预测下一个词符，LLM需要表示当前词的语义和表层信息。先前研究已识别出两种能解耦这些信息的注意力头类型，本文旨在探索这些头如何用于识别模型激活中的语义结构子空间。

Method: 使用概念归纳头和词符归纳头的注意力权重来变换Llama-2-7b的隐藏状态，通过这种变换来执行平行四边形算术操作和最近邻检索。

Result: 变换后的隐藏状态在平行四边形算术（如"雅典"-"希腊"+"中国"="北京"）上表现优异，最近邻准确率达到80%，远高于原始隐藏状态的47%。词符头变换也能有效揭示表层词信息。

Conclusion: 特定类型的注意力头可以识别出模型激活中的语义结构子空间，通过注意力权重变换隐藏状态能显著提升语义操作和检索任务的性能。

Abstract: In order to predict the next token, LLMs must represent semantic and surface-level information about the current word. Previous work identified two types of attention heads that disentangle this information: (i) Concept induction heads, which copy word meanings, and (ii) Token induction heads, which copy literal token representations (Feucht et al., 2025). We show that these heads can be used to identify subspaces of model activations that exhibit coherent semantic structure in Llama-2-7b. Specifically, when we transform hidden states using the attention weights of concept heads, we are able to more accurately perform parallelogram arithmetic (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the resulting hidden states, e.g., showing that "Athens" - "Greece" + "China" = "Beijing". This transformation allows for much higher nearest-neighbor accuracy (80%) than direct use of raw hidden states (47%). Analogously, we show that token heads allow for transformations that reveal surface-level word information in hidden states, allowing for operations like "coding" - "code" + "dance" = "dancing".

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作缺乏对金融文档中向量和非向量RAG架构的系统比较，且高级RAG技术对检索准确性、答案质量、延迟和成本的经验影响尚不明确。

Method: 使用1200份SEC文件在150个问题基准上评估两种架构：向量智能RAG（混合搜索+元数据过滤）vs层次节点系统（无嵌入遍历文档结构），并测试交叉编码器重排序和小到大块检索两种增强技术。

Result: 向量智能RAG在答案质量上胜出68%，延迟相当（5.2 vs 5.98秒）；交叉编码器重排序在最优参数下MRR@5提升59%；小到大块检索胜出65%，仅增加0.2秒延迟。

Conclusion: 在金融问答系统中应用高级RAG技术可显著提升检索准确性和答案质量，但在生产环境中需要考虑成本-性能权衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) have enabled Large Language Models to answer financial questions using external knowledge bases of U.S. SEC filings, earnings reports, and regulatory documents. However, existing work lacks systematic comparison of vector-based and non-vector RAG architectures for financial documents, and the empirical impact of advanced RAG techniques on retrieval accuracy, answer quality, latency, and cost remain unclear. We present the first systematic evaluation comparing vector-based agentic RAG using hybrid search and metadata filtering against hierarchical node-based systems that traverse document structure without embeddings. We evaluate two enhancement techniques applied to the vector-based architecture, i) cross-encoder reranking for retrieval precision, and ii) small-to-big chunk retrieval for context completeness. Across 1,200 SEC 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings on a 150-question benchmark, we measure retrieval metrics (MRR, Recall@5), answer quality through LLM-as-a-judge pairwise comparisons, latency, and preprocessing costs. Vector-based agentic RAG achieves a 68% win rate over hierarchical node-based systems with comparable latency (5.2 compared to 5.98 seconds). Cross-encoder reranking achieves a 59% absolute improvement at optimal parameters (10, 5) for MRR@5. Small-to-big retrieval achieves a 65% win rate over baseline chunking with only 0.2 seconds additional latency. Our findings reveal that applying advanced RAG techniques to financial Q&A systems improves retrieval accuracy, answer quality, and has cost-performance tradeoffs to be considered in production.

Conclusion: Agent-as-a-Graph检索方法通过知识图谱表示和检索策略，显著提升了多代理系统中代理选择的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration and retrieval of specialized, parallelized subagents, each equipped with hundreds or thousands of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and tools. However, existing agent, MCP, and retrieval methods typically match queries against a single agent description, obscuring fine-grained tool capabilities of each agent, resulting in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Agent-as-a-Graph retrieval, a knowledge graph retrieval augmented generation approach that represents both tools and their parent agents as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph. During retrieval, i) relevant agents and tool nodes are first retrieved through vector search, ii) we apply a type-specific weighted reciprocal rank fusion (wRRF) for reranking tools and agents, and iii) parent agents are traversed in the knowledge graph for the final set of agents. We evaluate Agent-as-a-Graph on the LiveMCPBenchmark, achieving 14.9% and 14.6% improvements in Recall@5 and nDCG@5 over prior state-of-the-art retrievers, and 2.4% improvements in wRRF optimizations.

Abstract: Pharmaceutical research and development has accumulated vast, heterogeneous archives of data. Much of this knowledge stems from discontinued programs, and reusing these archives is invaluable for reverse translation. However, in practice, such reuse is often infeasible. In this work, we introduce DiscoVerse, a multi-agent co-scientist designed to support pharmaceutical research and development. The system implements semantic retrieval, cross-document linking, and auditable synthesis on a large historical corpus from Roche. To validate our approach at real-world scale, we selected a subset of 180 molecules from the Roche research repositories, covering over 0.87 billion BPE tokens and more than four decades of research. Given that automated evaluation metrics are poorly aligned with scientific utility, we evaluate the performance of DiscoVerse using blinded expert evaluation of source-linked outputs. To our knowledge, this is the first agentic framework systematically assessed on real pharmaceutical data for reverse translation, enabled by authorized access to confidential, end-to-end drug-development archives. Our contributions include role-specialized agent designs aligned with scientist workflows; human-in-the-loop support for reverse translation; expert evaluation; and a large-scale demonstration showing promising answer accuracy and decision-making insights. In brief, across seven benchmark queries covering 180 molecules, DiscoVerse achieved near-perfect recall ($\geq 0.99$) with moderate precision ($0.71-0.91$), while qualitative assessments of discontinuation rationale and organ-specific toxicity showed faithful, source-linked synthesis across preclinical and clinical evidence.

Abstract: The detection of hallucinations in multilingual scientific text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant challenges for reliable AI systems. This paper describes our submission to the SHROOM-CAP 2025 shared task on scientific hallucination detection across 9 languages. Unlike most approaches that focus primarily on model architecture, we adopted a data-centric strategy that addressed the critical issue of training data scarcity and imbalance. We unify and balance five existing datasets to create a comprehensive training corpus of 124,821 samples (50% correct, 50% hallucinated), representing a 172x increase over the original SHROOM training data. Our approach fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa-Large with 560 million parameters on this enhanced dataset, achieves competitive performance across all languages, including \textbf{2nd place in Gujarati} (zero-shot language) with Factuality F1 of 0.5107, and rankings between 4th-6th place across the remaining 8 languages. Our results demonstrate that systematic data curation can significantly outperform architectural innovations alone, particularly for low-resource languages in zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Building codes contain critical information for ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and informed decision-making in construction and engineering. Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%. Our results highlight the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt powerful VLMs for understanding complex structured data in specialized fields, such as building code interpretation and regulatory compliance.

Motivation: LLM代理从知识库检索上下文时，由于缺乏与当前推理状态的结构一致性，导致推理链不连贯。

Method: PCR方法将搜索空间限制在从锚节点可达的节点范围内，结合图结构约束和语义搜索进行检索。

Result: 在PathRAG-6基准测试中，PCR实现100%结构一致性（基线方法仅24-32%），同时保持强相关性得分，在技术领域实现排名10时100%相关性和完全结构一致性。

Conclusion: 路径约束检索是提高LLM代理推理系统可靠性和连贯性的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Model agents often retrieve context from knowledge bases that lack structural consistency with the agent's current reasoning state, leading to incoherent reasoning chains. We introduce Path-Constrained Retrieval (PCR), a retrieval method that combines structural graph constraints with semantic search to ensure retrieved information maintains logical relationships within a knowledge graph. PCR restricts the search space to nodes reachable from an anchor node, preventing retrieval of structurally disconnected information that may lead to inconsistent reasoning. We evaluate PCR on PathRAG-6, a benchmark spanning six domains with 180 nodes and 360 edges. Our results show that PCR achieves full structural consistency compared to 24-32 percent in baseline methods, while maintaining strong relevance scores. On the technology domain, PCR obtains full relevance at rank 10 with full structural consistency, significantly outperforming vector search and hybrid retrieval. PCR reduces the average graph distance of retrieved context by 78 percent compared to baselines, demonstrating retrieval of more structurally consistent information. These findings suggest that path-constrained retrieval is an effective approach for improving the reliability and coherence of LLM agent reasoning systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了"Gradient Masters"方法用于BLP-2025任务1的孟加拉语多任务仇恨言论识别，采用集成微调策略处理仇恨类型分类和目标群体分类两个子任务，在YouTube评论数据集上取得了良好表现。

Abstract: This paper introduces the approach of "Gradient Masters" for BLP-2025 Task 1: "Bangla Multitask Hate Speech Identification Shared Task". We present an ensemble-based fine-tuning strategy for addressing subtasks 1A (hate-type classification) and 1B (target group classification) in YouTube comments. We propose a hybrid approach on a Bangla Language Model, which outperformed the baseline models and secured the 6th position in subtask 1A with a micro F1 score of 73.23% and the third position in subtask 1B with 73.28%. We conducted extensive experiments that evaluated the robustness of the model throughout the development and evaluation phases, including comparisons with other Language Model variants, to measure generalization in low-resource Bangla hate speech scenarios and data set coverage. In addition, we provide a detailed analysis of our findings, exploring misclassification patterns in the detection of hate speech.

*James Y. Huang,Wenxuan Zhou,Nan Xu,Fei Wang,Qin Liu,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OmniStruct是一个评估LLMs在文本到结构任务上能力的综合基准，通过合成数据训练的小模型可以达到GPT-4o的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现代LLMs在生成非结构化自然语言响应方面表现出色，但它们在文本到结构任务（如信息提取、表格生成和函数调用）上的性能仍不清楚，需要建立统一评估基准。

Method: 构建OmniStruct基准，整合现有适合结构化答案格式的数据集，并通过合成任务生成收集高质量训练数据，在不使用监督数据的情况下微调小模型。

Result: 实验表明，仅使用合成数据微调的小模型可以在文本到结构任务上达到与GPT-4o相媲美的性能。

Conclusion: 通过合成数据训练的小模型可以成为通用的结构化生成模型，在文本到结构任务上表现优异，为开发高效的结构化生成模型提供了可能性。

Abstract: The ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate structured outputs that follow arbitrary schemas is crucial to a wide range of downstream tasks that require diverse structured representations of results such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. While modern LLMs excel in generating unstructured responses in natural language, whether this advancement translates to a strong performance on text-to-structure tasks remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first introduce OmniStruct, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' capabilities on diverse text-to-structure tasks such as information extraction, table generation, and function calling. We build OmniStruct by identifying existing datasets across a wide range of tasks that are suitable for a structured answer format, and adapting them under a unified text-to-structure problem setting. To facilitate the development of efficient text-to-structure models, we collect high-quality training data via synthetic task generation. Without using any supervised data for OmniStruct tasks, our experiments demonstrate the possibility of fine-tuning much smaller models on synthetic data into universal structured generation models that can rival the performance of GPT-4o.

*Manon Berriche*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了假新闻在社交媒体中占比虽小但影响巨大的悖论，以及政治极化加剧与用户对假新闻接受度不高之间的矛盾。通过混合方法研究发现，假新闻传播集中在少数高度政治化的用户群体中，用户会根据社交情境采取不同形式的批判性距离，但这些互动往往导致无效对话而非真正的审议辩论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解释两个悖论：为什么在缺乏编辑控制和新闻规范的情况下，实证研究发现假新闻在社交媒体中只占很小比例；以及为什么用户对假新闻的接受度不高，但政治极化却在加剧。

Method: 采用混合方法设计，在Twitter和Facebook上进行两项互补研究，结合数字痕迹的定量分析、在线观察和访谈，考察不同互动情境下的多样化实践。

Result: 1. 假新闻分享集中在少数高度政治化、对制度持批判态度的用户群体中；2. 用户根据社会地位和互动情境采取不同形式的批判性距离；3. 这些批判性互动很少产生真正的审议辩论，而是导致少数活跃用户间的无效对话。

Conclusion: 假新闻的影响主要通过少数高度活跃的政治化用户实现，用户的批判性反应受社交情境影响，但这些互动往往无法促成真正的民主审议，反而加剧了对话的隔阂。

Abstract: This thesis addresses two paradoxes: (1) why empirical studies find that fake news represent only a small share of the information consulted and shared on social media despite the absence of editorial control or journalistic norms, and (2) how political polarization has intensified even though users do not appear especially receptive to fake news. To investigate these issues, two complementary studies were carried out on Twitter and Facebook, combining quantitative analyses of digital traces with online observation and interviews. This mixed-methods design avoids reducing users to single reactions to identified fake items and instead examines the variety of practices across different interactional situations, online and offline, while recording socio-demographic traits. The first study mapped users who shared at least one item labeled fake by fact-checkers in the French Twittersphere. The second used a corpus of items flagged by Facebook users to study reactions to statements whose epistemic status is uncertain. Three main findings emerge. First, sharing fake news is concentrated among a limited group of users who are not less educated or cognitively disadvantaged but are more politicized and critical of institutions; owing to their high activity and prolific sharing, they can help set the agenda for their political camp. Second, exposed users can deploy varying forms of critical distance depending on their social position and the interactional norms of the situations they inhabit: either discursive caution (prudence énonciative) or interventions ('points d'arrêt') that express disagreement or corrections. Third, these forms of critical distance seldom yield genuine deliberative debates or agonistic pluralism; rather, they often produce dialogues of the deaf among a small, particularly active minority.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本常因人为错误或自动化流程故障而质量下降，这会影响AI辅助决策的可靠性和公平性，但此类退化的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入临床基础的标签缩减方案和分层思维链策略，模拟临床医生的推理过程，在多样化的文本退化场景下评估最先进的LLM。

Result: 该方法提高了模型在退化输入下的鲁棒性，减少了亚组不稳定性，推动了LLM在临床决策支持系统中的可靠使用。

Conclusion: 提出的分层思维链方法有效提升了LLM在临床决策支持中的鲁棒性和公平性，为可靠使用AI辅助医疗决策提供了解决方案。

Abstract: A decade of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for clinical decision support systems (CDSS), with large language models (LLMs) demonstrating strong reasoning abilities on timely medical tasks. However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning. Our approach improves robustness and reduces subgroup instability under degraded inputs, advancing the reliable use of LLMs in CDSS. We release code at https://github.com/heejkoo9/NECHOv3.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机械可解释性研究中进展衡量困难的问题，通过标准化评估框架来比较不同MI技术。

Method: 扩展MIB基准为社区共享任务，包含电路定位(识别因果影响组件)和因果变量定位(将激活映射为可解释特征)两个赛道，采用集成、正则化、低维非线性投影等方法。

Result: 在电路定位中，8种方法通过集成和正则化策略取得显著提升；在因果变量定位中，2种方法通过低维非线性投影实现显著改进。

Conclusion: MIB排行榜保持开放，鼓励在该标准化评估框架下继续推进机械可解释性研究。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability (MI) seeks to uncover how language models (LMs) implement specific behaviors, yet measuring progress in MI remains challenging. The recently released Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB; Mueller et al., 2025) provides a standardized framework for evaluating circuit and causal variable localization. Building on this foundation, the BlackboxNLP 2025 Shared Task extends MIB into a community-wide reproducible comparison of MI techniques. The shared task features two tracks: circuit localization, which assesses methods that identify causally influential components and interactions driving model behavior, and causal variable localization, which evaluates approaches that map activations into interpretable features. With three teams spanning eight different methods, participants achieved notable gains in circuit localization using ensemble and regularization strategies for circuit discovery. With one team spanning two methods, participants achieved significant gains in causal variable localization using low-dimensional and non-linear projections to featurize activation vectors. The MIB leaderboard remains open; we encourage continued work in this standard evaluation framework to measure progress in MI research going forward.

TL;DR: SmolKalam是一个阿拉伯语多轮对话数据集，通过多模型集成翻译管道从Smoltalk2翻译而来，并应用质量过滤和消融研究来优化翻译效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏包含推理和工具调用的大规模阿拉伯语多轮对话数据集，而单纯的翻译方法在预训练后阶段需要更高质量的数据集。

Method: 使用多模型集成翻译管道，应用质量过滤，并通过消融研究检验对传统仅解码器模型有效的翻译技术。

Result: 成功创建了SmolKalam数据集，这是Smoltalk2的阿拉伯语翻译版本。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高质量阿拉伯语对话数据集提供了有效的解决方案，特别适用于后训练阶段的需求。

Abstract: Although the community has tackled the acquisition of high-quality Arabic pretraining data, we still lack large-scale, multi-turn Arabic datasets that include reasoning and tool calling. Naive translation can work at the pretraining scale, but post-training demands much higher quality, which requires a stricter approach to dataset curation. In this work, we introduce SmolKalam, a translation of Smoltalk2 that uses a multi-model ensemble translation pipeline, applies quality filtering, and examines effective translation techniques for traditional decoder-only models through ablations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了多智能体协同过滤框架MACF，将传统协同过滤算法类比为基于LLM的多智能体协作，通过动态智能体招募和个性化协作指令来改进智能体推荐系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体推荐系统大多关注通用单智能体或多智能体任务分解流程，缺乏推荐导向设计，未能充分利用用户-物品交互历史中的协同信号，导致推荐结果不理想。

Method: 将相似用户和相关物品实例化为具有独特配置文件的LLM智能体，每个智能体能够调用检索工具、推荐候选物品并与其他智能体交互，通过中央编排器智能体动态管理智能体间的协作。

Result: 在三个不同领域的数据集上的实验结果表明，MACF框架相比强大的智能体推荐基线具有优势。

Conclusion: MACF框架通过将传统协同过滤算法转化为多智能体协作范式，有效提升了智能体推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Agentic recommendations cast recommenders as large language model (LLM) agents that can plan, reason, use tools, and interact with users of varying preferences in web applications. However, most existing agentic recommender systems focus on generic single-agent plan-execute workflows or multi-agent task decomposition pipelines. Without recommendation-oriented design, they often underuse the collaborative signals in the user-item interaction history, leading to unsatisfying recommendation results. To address this, we propose the Multi-Agent Collaborative Filtering (MACF) framework for agentic recommendations, drawing an analogy between traditional collaborative filtering algorithms and LLM-based multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, given a target user and query, we instantiate similar users and relevant items as LLM agents with unique profiles. Each agent is able to call retrieval tools, suggest candidate items, and interact with other agents. Different from the static preference aggregation in traditional collaborative filtering, MACF employs a central orchestrator agent to adaptively manage the collaboration between user and item agents via dynamic agent recruitment and personalized collaboration instruction. Experimental results on datasets from three different domains show the advantages of our MACF framework compared to strong agentic recommendation baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决静态记忆系统在预先创建可用记忆时不可避免的信息丢失问题。

Method: 采用双组件设计：1) Memorizer使用轻量级记忆突出关键历史信息，同时在通用页面存储中维护完整历史；2) Researcher根据预构建记忆从页面存储中检索和整合有用信息。

Result: 在多种基于记忆的任务完成场景中，相比现有记忆系统实现了显著改进。

Conclusion: GAM框架能够有效利用前沿大语言模型的代理能力和测试时扩展性，同时通过强化学习促进端到端性能优化。

Abstract: Memory is critical for AI agents, yet the widely-adopted static memory, aiming to create readily available memory in advance, is inevitably subject to severe information loss. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework called \textbf{general agentic memory (GAM)}. GAM follows the principle of "\textbf{just-in time (JIT) compilation}" where it focuses on creating optimized contexts for its client at runtime while keeping only simple but useful memory during the offline stage. To this end, GAM employs a duo-design with the following components. 1) \textbf{Memorizer}, which highlights key historical information using a lightweight memory, while maintaining complete historical information within a universal page-store. 2) \textbf{Researcher}, which retrieves and integrates useful information from the page-store for its online request guided by the pre-constructed memory. This design allows GAM to effectively leverage the agentic capabilities and test-time scalability of frontier large language models (LLMs), while also facilitating end-to-end performance optimization through reinforcement learning. In our experimental study, we demonstrate that GAM achieves substantial improvement on various memory-grounded task completion scenarios against existing memory systems.

Motivation: 当前AI心理健康聊天机器人存在谄媚、过度验证和强化不良信念等局限，且缺乏能够捕捉真实治疗互动复杂性的基准测试。

Method: 与临床心理学家合作设计MindEval框架，通过患者模拟和LLM自动评估，在真实的多轮治疗对话中测试语言模型。

Result: 评估了12个最先进的LLM，所有模型平均得分低于4/6，在AI特有的沟通模式方面表现尤其薄弱，推理能力和模型规模不能保证更好的表现。

Conclusion: 现有语言模型在心理健康治疗对话中表现不足，需要专门针对治疗性沟通进行优化，而非仅仅依赖通用能力提升。

Abstract: Demand for mental health support through AI chatbots is surging, though current systems present several limitations, like sycophancy or overvalidation, and reinforcement of maladaptive beliefs. A core obstacle to the creation of better systems is the scarcity of benchmarks that capture the complexity of real therapeutic interactions. Most existing benchmarks either only test clinical knowledge through multiple-choice questions or assess single responses in isolation. To bridge this gap, we present MindEval, a framework designed in collaboration with Ph.D-level Licensed Clinical Psychologists for automatically evaluating language models in realistic, multi-turn mental health therapy conversations. Through patient simulation and automatic evaluation with LLMs, our framework balances resistance to gaming with reproducibility via its fully automated, model-agnostic design. We begin by quantitatively validating the realism of our simulated patients against human-generated text and by demonstrating strong correlations between automatic and human expert judgments. Then, we evaluate 12 state-of-the-art LLMs and show that all models struggle, scoring below 4 out of 6, on average, with particular weaknesses in problematic AI-specific patterns of communication. Notably, reasoning capabilities and model scale do not guarantee better performance, and systems deteriorate with longer interactions or when supporting patients with severe symptoms. We release all code, prompts, and human evaluation data.

Abstract: This position paper argues that literary scholars must engage with large language model (LLM) interpretability research. While doing so will involve ideological struggle, if not out-right complicity, the necessity of this engagement is clear: the abiding instrumentality of current approaches to interpretability cannot be the only standard by which we measure interpretation with LLMs. One site at which this struggle could take place, I suggest, is the red team.

Motivation: 探索LLM在结构化任务（如预测编程题目难度）中的表现，特别是在模型输出评估和学习活动中的应用潜力。

Method: 系统比较GPT-4o（纯自然语言难度评估器）与基于显式数值和文本特征的LightGBM集成模型，在1825个LeetCode题目数据集上进行评估。

Result: LightGBM达到86%准确率，GPT-4o仅37.75%；数值约束（如输入大小限制和接受率）对区分难题至关重要，而GPT-4o常忽略这些线索。

Conclusion: LLM在编程题目难度评估等结构化任务中存在具体失败模式，在应用于竞争性编程、教育平台或强化学习管道前需要解决这些问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language and code generation, and are increasingly deployed as automatic judges of model outputs and learning activities. Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy. Our findings connect to recent work on LLMs-as-judges and automatic difficulty estimation in programming and education, and highlight concrete failure modes that must be addressed before LLM-based judges can be considered trustworthy in competitive programming, educational platforms, or reinforcement-learning pipelines.

Motivation: 信念对人类推理、沟通和社交至关重要，但现有计算方法局限于狭窄的社会政治背景且依赖微调。需要了解LLM在不同信念领域的泛化能力。

Method: 使用在线辩论平台数据，构建包含多种信息条件的基准测试，在零样本设置下评估LLM预测个体立场的表现，隔离人口统计背景和已知先验信念对预测成功的贡献。

Result: 提供更多个体背景信息能提高预测准确性，但性能在不同信念领域差异显著。多个中小型模型的测试结果显示了当前LLM模拟人类推理的能力和局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前LLM模拟人类推理的能力和局限性，为机器行为研究提供了进展，并提供了超越社会政治领域的信念系统建模的可扩展框架。

Abstract: Beliefs are central to how humans reason, communicate, and form social connections, yet most computational approaches to studying them remain confined to narrow sociopolitical contexts and rely on fine-tuning for optimal performance. Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) across disciplines, how well these systems generalize across diverse belief domains remains unclear. We introduce a systematic, reproducible benchmark that evaluates the ability of LLMs to predict individuals' stances on a wide range of topics in a zero-shot setting using data from an online debate platform. The benchmark includes multiple informational conditions that isolate the contribution of demographic context and known prior beliefs to predictive success. Across several small- to medium-sized models, we find that providing more background information about an individual improves predictive accuracy, but performance varies substantially across belief domains. These findings reveal both the capacity and limitations of current LLMs to emulate human reasoning, advancing the study of machine behavior and offering a scalable framework for modeling belief systems beyond the sociopolitical sphere.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 报纸是重要的信息来源，但有效导航大量新闻内容具有挑战性。新闻标题情感分析可以帮助快速理解新闻的情感基调，这对孟加拉语这种低资源语言尤为重要。

Method: 使用BERT-CNN-BiLSTM混合迁移学习模型，在9014条孟加拉语新闻标题数据集上应用两种实验策略：技术1（分割前进行欠采样和过采样）和技术2（分割后进行欠采样和过采样）。

Result: 技术1中过采样在标题和情感分类上表现最佳，准确率分别为78.57%和73.43%；技术2中直接在原始不平衡数据集上训练效果最好，准确率分别为81.37%和64.46%。

Conclusion: BERT-CNN-BiLSTM模型在分类任务中显著优于所有基线模型，为孟加拉语文本分类在低资源环境下提供了强大的基准，证明了同时利用标题和情感数据集的重要性。

Abstract: In our daily lives, newspapers are an essential information source that impacts how the public talks about present-day issues. However, effectively navigating the vast amount of news content from different newspapers and online news portals can be challenging. Newspaper headlines with sentiment analysis tell us what the news is about (e.g., politics, sports) and how the news makes us feel (positive, negative, neutral). This helps us quickly understand the emotional tone of the news. This research presents a state-of-the-art approach to Bangla news headline classification combined with sentiment analysis applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, particularly the hybrid transfer learning model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM. We have explored a dataset called BAN-ABSA of 9014 news headlines, which is the first time that has been experimented with simultaneously in the headline and sentiment categorization in Bengali newspapers. Over this imbalanced dataset, we applied two experimental strategies: technique-1, where undersampling and oversampling are applied before splitting, and technique-2, where undersampling and oversampling are applied after splitting on the In technique-1 oversampling provided the strongest performance, both headline and sentiment, that is 78.57\% and 73.43\% respectively, while technique-2 delivered the highest result when trained directly on the original imbalanced dataset, both headline and sentiment, that is 81.37\% and 64.46\% respectively. The proposed model BERT-CNN-BiLSTM significantly outperforms all baseline models in classification tasks, and achieves new state-of-the-art results for Bangla news headline classification and sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the importance of leveraging both the headline and sentiment datasets, and provide a strong baseline for Bangla text classification in low-resource.

### [361] [Prompt Optimization as a State-Space Search Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18619)
*Maanas Taneja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将提示优化建模为状态空间搜索问题，使用束搜索和随机游走算法在提示空间中进行系统探索，在五个NLP任务上验证了该方法能有效提升提示性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型对输入提示的微小变化极其敏感，容易导致性能崩溃。受DSpy等基于演示的提示优化方法启发，作者希望探索一种替代方法，将提示优化视为经典的状态空间搜索问题。

Method: 将提示空间建模为图结构，节点代表提示状态，边对应有意的转换操作（如缩短、添加示例、重新排序内容）。使用束搜索和随机游走算法系统探索该空间，在开发集上评估候选提示并剪枝无希望的路径。

Result: 在五个NLP任务上，即使浅层搜索配置（束宽=2，深度=2）也能在开发集上超越种子提示。例如，在推理任务中，束搜索将开发集准确率从0.40提升到0.80，但测试集改进较为温和（从0.20到0.50），表明存在对开发集启发式的过拟合。

Conclusion: 结果验证了将提示优化作为搜索问题的有效性，并表明通过更多计算资源和改进的评估指标，更深入的探索可以产生更鲁棒、能泛化到开发集之外的提示。

Abstract: Language Models are extremely susceptible to performance collapse with even small changes to input prompt strings. Libraries such as DSpy (from Stanford NLP) avoid this problem through demonstration-based prompt optimisation. Inspired by this, I propose an alternative approach that treats prompt optimisation as a classical state-space search problem. I model the prompt space as a graph where nodes represent prompt states and edges correspond to deliberate transformations such as shortening, adding examples, or re- ordering content. Using beam search and random walk algorithms, I systematically explore this space, evaluating candidates on development sets and pruning unpromising branches. Across five NLP tasks (sentiment classification, question answering, summarisation, reason- ing, and natural language inference), I find that even shallow search configurations (beam width=2, depth=2) improve upon seed prompts on development sets. For instance, beam search achieves development accuracy gains from 0.40 to 0.80 on reasoning tasks, though test set improvements are more modest (0.20 to 0.50), indicating overfitting to the develop- ment heuristic. Analysis of successful optimisation paths reveals that transformations that make prompts concise appear most frequently, while verbosity operators are never selected. My results validate prompt optimization as a search problem and suggest that with greater computational resources and improved evaluation metrics, deeper exploration could yield more robust prompts that generalize beyond development sets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenGloss是一个合成的英语百科全书词典和语义知识图谱，整合了词典定义、百科全书背景、词源历史和语义关系，包含53.7万个词义和150万个词条，生成成本低于1000美元且用时不到一周。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统词典资源手动编纂成本高、周期长的问题，通过结构化生成创建综合词汇资源，填补教学应用中的空白，支持词汇学习和自然语言处理任务。

Method: 采用多智能体程序生成流水线，结合模式验证的LLM输出和自动化质量保证，快速生成结构化词汇资源。

Result: 生成了包含53.7万个词义、150万个词条、910万条语义边、100万个使用示例、300万个搭配和6000万词百科全书内容的资源，规模与WordNet 3.1相当但定义数量多四倍。

Conclusion: 结构化生成能够以手动编纂无法实现的时间和成本规模创建全面词汇资源，随着基础模型的改进可实现快速迭代，该资源已在Hugging Face上公开供研究和教育使用。

Abstract: We present OpenGloss, a synthetic encyclopedic dictionary and semantic knowledge graph for English that integrates lexicographic definitions, encyclopedic context, etymological histories, and semantic relationships in a unified resource. OpenGloss contains 537K senses across 150K lexemes, on par with WordNet 3.1 and Open English WordNet, while providing more than four times as many sense definitions. These lexemes include 9.1M semantic edges, 1M usage examples, 3M collocations, and 60M words of encyclopedic content.
  Generated through a multi-agent procedural generation pipeline with schema-validated LLM outputs and automated quality assurance, the entire resource was produced in under one week for under $1,000. This demonstrates that structured generation can create comprehensive lexical resources at cost and time scales impractical for manual curation, enabling rapid iteration as foundation models improve. The resource addresses gaps in pedagogical applications by providing integrated content -- definitions, examples, collocations, encyclopedias, etymology -- that supports both vocabulary learning and natural language processing tasks.
  As a synthetically generated resource, OpenGloss reflects both the capabilities and limitations of current foundation models. The dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face under CC-BY 4.0, enabling researchers and educators to build upon and adapt this resource.

*Shireen Chand,Faith Baca,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了针对性偏见缓解的跨类别后果，发现虽然针对性缓解可以减少目标维度的偏见，但经常在其他维度产生负面后果，如增加模型偏见和降低整体连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型从训练数据中继承了社会偏见，可能导致有害或不公平的输出。现有偏见缓解技术通常只评估目标偏见维度的影响，缺乏对跨类别后果的研究。

Method: 研究了四种偏见缓解技术，应用于来自七个模型家族的十个模型，探索了种族、宗教、职业和性别相关偏见，使用StereoSet基准测量偏见缓解对模型连贯性和刻板印象偏好的影响。

Result: 结果表明，针对性偏见缓解有时能减少目标维度的偏见，但经常在其他维度产生意外负面后果，包括增加模型偏见和降低一般连贯性。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在检查和开发偏见缓解策略时需要强大的多维评估工具，以避免无意中在未目标轴上转移或恶化偏见。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) inherit societal biases from their training data, potentially leading to harmful or unfair outputs. While various techniques aim to mitigate these biases, their effects are often evaluated only along the dimension of the bias being targeted. This work investigates the cross-category consequences of targeted bias mitigation. We study four bias mitigation techniques applied across ten models from seven model families, and we explore racial, religious, profession- and gender-related biases. We measure the impact of debiasing on model coherence and stereotypical preference using the StereoSet benchmark. Our results consistently show that while targeted mitigation can sometimes reduce bias in the intended dimension, it frequently leads to unintended and often negative consequences in others, such as increasing model bias and decreasing general coherence. These findings underscore the critical need for robust, multi-dimensional evaluation tools when examining and developing bias mitigation strategies to avoid inadvertently shifting or worsening bias along untargeted axes.

TL;DR: 本研究使用2026年韩国高考数学卷对24个先进大语言模型进行系统评估，GPT-5 Codex获得满分，几何是表现最差的领域，文本输入优于图像输入，推理增强会显著增加成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基准测试中数据泄露问题，在完全无污染的环境中评估LLMs的数学推理能力，提供真实考试环境下的模型表现评估。

Method: 在考试公开后2小时内数字化所有46道题目，评估24个LLM在不同输入模式（文本、图像、文本+图像）和提示语言（韩语、英语）下的表现，并进行推理增强实验。

Result: GPT-5 Codex获得唯一满分，Grok 4、GPT-5和Deepseek R1得分超过95分，gpt-oss-20B以较小规模获得95.7分显示高性价比，几何领域平均正确率仅77.7%，文本输入优于图像输入。

Conclusion: 建立了完全未暴露的评估环境，提供了基于真实考试的LLM评估框架，建议在性能、成本和时间综合考虑下，最小推理的模型可能更实用。

Abstract: This study systematically evaluated the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the 2026 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) Mathematics section, ensuring a completely contamination-free evaluation environment. To address data leakage issues in existing benchmarks, we digitized all 46 questions (22 common and 24 elective) within two hours of the exam's public release, eliminating any possibility of inclusion in model training data. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of 24 state-of-the-art LLMs across varying input modalities (text, image, text+figure) and prompt languages (Korean, English).
  GPT-5 Codex achieved the only perfect score (100 points) with text input and Korean prompts, while Grok 4, GPT-5, and Deepseek R1 scored above 95 points. Notably, gpt-oss-20B achieved 95.7 points despite its relatively small size, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. Problem-specific analysis revealed geometry as the weakest domain (77.7% average) with significant performance degradation on 4-point high-difficulty problems. Text input consistently outperformed image input, while prompt language effects varied by model scale.
  In reasoning enhancement experiments with GPT-5 series, increased reasoning intensity improved performance (from 82.6 to 100 points) but quadrupled token usage and drastically reduced efficiency, suggesting that models with minimal reasoning may be more practical. This research contributes: (1) implementation of a completely unexposed evaluation environment, (2) a real-exam-based LLM assessment framework, and (3) a practical evaluation perspective integrating performance, cost, and time considerations. Detailed results and model comparisons are available at the 2026 Korean CSAT LLM Evaluation Leaderboard (https://isoft.cnu.ac.kr/csat2026/).

Motivation: 传统的检索增强生成方法存在长上下文问题和检索与生成模块分离优化的问题，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出CLaRa框架，使用SCP数据合成框架生成语义丰富的压缩向量，通过可微分top-k估计器实现重排序器和生成器的端到端训练，使用单一语言建模损失。

Result: 在多个QA基准测试中，CLaRa实现了最先进的压缩和重排序性能，通常超过基于文本的微调基线。

Conclusion: CLaRa通过统一的连续空间优化，成功对齐了检索相关性和答案质量，为检索增强生成提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge but still suffers from long contexts and disjoint retrieval-generation optimization. In this work, we propose CLaRa (Continuous Latent Reasoning), a unified framework that performs embedding-based compression and joint optimization in a shared continuous space. To obtain semantically rich and retrievable compressed vectors, we introduce SCP, a key-preserving data synthesis framework using QA and paraphrase supervision. CLaRa then trains the reranker and generator end-to-end via a single language modeling loss, with gradients flowing through both modules using a differentiable top-k estimator. Theoretically, this unified optimization aligns retrieval relevance with answer quality. Experiments across multiple QA benchmarks show that CLaRa achieves state-of-the-art compression and reranking performance, often surpassing text-based fine-tuned baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统采用线性的规划-搜索-写作-报告流程，存在错误累积和上下文腐化问题，缺乏对模型行为和上下文的显式控制。

Method: 1) 可验证清单模块将用户需求转化为可追溯的子目标，通过批评者优化并生成层次化大纲；2) 证据审计模块结构化搜索内容，迭代更新大纲，修剪噪声上下文，并通过批评者绑定高质量证据。

Result: 实验表明RhinoInsight在深度研究任务上达到最先进性能，同时在深度搜索任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: RhinoInsight通过两个控制机制有效解决了现有系统的局限性，显著提升了深度研究任务的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models are evolving from single-turn responders into tool-using agents capable of sustained reasoning and decision-making for deep research. Prevailing systems adopt a linear pipeline of plan to search to write to a report, which suffers from error accumulation and context rot due to the lack of explicit control over both model behavior and context. We introduce RhinoInsight, a deep research framework that adds two control mechanisms to enhance robustness, traceability, and overall quality without parameter updates. First, a Verifiable Checklist module transforms user requirements into traceable and verifiable sub-goals, incorporates human or LLM critics for refinement, and compiles a hierarchical outline to anchor subsequent actions and prevent non-executable planning. Second, an Evidence Audit module structures search content, iteratively updates the outline, and prunes noisy context, while a critic ranks and binds high-quality evidence to drafted content to ensure verifiability and reduce hallucinations. Our experiments demonstrate that RhinoInsight achieves state-of-the-art performance on deep research tasks while remaining competitive on deep search tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM具备推理能力和网络搜索功能，且被用户广泛用于事实核查，急需对这些模型在事实核查任务上的表现进行严格评估。

Method: 在PolitiFact的6000多个事实核查声明上评估15个最新LLM，比较标准模型、推理变体和网络搜索变体的表现。

Result: 标准模型表现差，推理能力提供有限帮助，网络搜索仅带来中等提升，而使用PolitiFact摘要的RAG系统平均将宏F1提高了233%。

Conclusion: 为模型提供经过筛选的高质量上下文信息是实现自动化事实核查的有前景路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have raised hopes for automated end-to-end fact-checking, but prior studies report mixed results. As mainstream chatbots increasingly ship with reasoning capabilities and web search tools -- and millions of users already rely on them for verification -- rigorous evaluation is urgent. We evaluate 15 recent LLMs from OpenAI, Google, Meta, and DeepSeek on more than 6,000 claims fact-checked by PolitiFact, comparing standard models with reasoning- and web-search variants. Standard models perform poorly, reasoning offers minimal benefits, and web search provides only moderate gains, despite fact-checks being available on the web. In contrast, a curated RAG system using PolitiFact summaries improved macro F1 by 233% on average across model variants. These findings suggest that giving models access to curated high-quality context is a promising path for automated fact-checking.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于分布的特征恢复与融合方法(DRF)，用于处理图像-文本对中低质量和缺失模态的鲁棒多模态情感分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对低质量和缺失模态的考虑，而现实应用中这些问题经常发生，需要能够鲁棒预测情感的模型。

Method: 为每个模态维护特征队列来近似特征分布，通过统一框架同时处理低质量和缺失模态：对低质量模态基于分布定量估计模态质量并减少其融合贡献；对缺失模态通过样本和分布监督构建跨模态映射关系，从可用模态恢复缺失模态。

Result: 在三个公开图像-文本数据集上的实验表明，DRF相比SOTA方法在两种破坏策略下都取得了普遍改进，验证了其在鲁棒多模态情感分析中的有效性。

Conclusion: DRF方法能够有效处理现实场景中的低质量和缺失模态问题，为鲁棒多模态情感分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As posts on social media increase rapidly, analyzing the sentiments embedded in image-text pairs has become a popular research topic in recent years. Although existing works achieve impressive accomplishments in simultaneously harnessing image and text information, they lack the considerations of possible low-quality and missing modalities. In real-world applications, these issues might frequently occur, leading to urgent needs for models capable of predicting sentiment robustly. Therefore, we propose a Distribution-based feature Recovery and Fusion (DRF) method for robust multimodal sentiment analysis of image-text pairs. Specifically, we maintain a feature queue for each modality to approximate their feature distributions, through which we can simultaneously handle low-quality and missing modalities in a unified framework. For low-quality modalities, we reduce their contributions to the fusion by quantitatively estimating modality qualities based on the distributions. For missing modalities, we build inter-modal mapping relationships supervised by samples and distributions, thereby recovering the missing modalities from available ones. In experiments, two disruption strategies that corrupt and discard some modalities in samples are adopted to mimic the low-quality and missing modalities in various real-world scenarios. Through comprehensive experiments on three publicly available image-text datasets, we demonstrate the universal improvements of DRF compared to SOTA methods under both two strategies, validating its effectiveness in robust multimodal sentiment analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等语言因方言变化大、标注数据有限而导致的低资源ASR挑战

Method: 使用解码器提示（首遍转录或检索语句）和编码器前缀（目标说话人语音合成），引入提示重排序、说话人感知前缀合成和模态特定检索技术

Result: 在9种阿拉伯语语言条件下，现代标准阿拉伯语WER降低22.3%，方言语音降低9.2%，显著减少幻觉和说话人不匹配

Conclusion: 上下文感知提示策略有效提升低资源ASR性能，特别是在方言变化大的阿拉伯语场景

Abstract: Low-resource ASR remains a challenging problem, especially for languages like Arabic that exhibit wide dialectal variation and limited labeled data. We propose context-aware prompting strategies to adapt OpenAI's Whisper for Arabic speech recognition without retraining. Our methods include decoder prompting with first-pass transcriptions or retrieved utterances, and encoder prefixing using speech synthesized in the target speaker's voice. We introduce techniques such as prompt reordering, speaker-aware prefix synthesis, and modality-specific retrieval (lexical, semantic, acoustic) to improve transcription in real-world, zero-shot settings. Evaluated on nine Arabic linguistic conditions, our approach reduces WER by up to 22.3% on Modern Standard Arabic and 9.2% on dialectal speech, significantly mitigating hallucinations and speaker mismatch.

Motivation: 现有的基于图的RAG方法主要依赖欧几里得嵌入，虽然能捕获语义相似性，但缺乏对知识图谱中固有层次结构关系的几何表示能力，限制了复杂知识推理的效果。

Method: 提出HyperbolicRAG框架，包含三个核心设计：(1)在Poincare流形中的深度感知表示学习器；(2)无监督对比正则化确保跨抽象层次的几何一致性；(3)互排序融合机制联合利用欧几里得和双曲空间的检索信号。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试上的广泛实验表明，HyperbolicRAG优于包括标准RAG和图增强基线在内的竞争方法。

Conclusion: 双曲几何能够有效增强图基RAG的表示能力，通过同时捕获语义相似性和层次结构关系，显著提升了复杂知识推理任务的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge, helping mitigate hallucinations and enhance domain-specific expertise. Graph-based RAG enhances structural reasoning by introducing explicit relational organization that enables information propagation across semantically connected text units. However, these methods typically rely on Euclidean embeddings that capture semantic similarity but lack a geometric notion of hierarchical depth, limiting their ability to represent abstraction relationships inherent in complex knowledge graphs. To capture both fine-grained semantics and global hierarchy, we propose HyperbolicRAG, a retrieval framework that integrates hyperbolic geometry into graph-based RAG. HyperbolicRAG introduces three key designs: (1) a depth-aware representation learner that embeds nodes within a shared Poincare manifold to align semantic similarity with hierarchical containment, (2) an unsupervised contrastive regularization that enforces geometric consistency across abstraction levels, and (3) a mutual-ranking fusion mechanism that jointly exploits retrieval signals from Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, emphasizing cross-space agreement during inference. Extensive experiments across multiple QA benchmarks demonstrate that HyperbolicRAG outperforms competitive baselines, including both standard RAG and graph-augmented baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在处理长上下文时面临信息过载问题，特别是在检索增强生成中，大量支持文档常包含冗余内容，这会降低推理准确性并增加计算开销。

Method: 构建AMR图，计算节点级概念熵来估计每个节点的概念重要性，筛选重要信息节点形成压缩的语义聚焦上下文。

Result: 在PopQA和EntityQuestions数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于原始方法和其他基线，在显著减少上下文长度的同时获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: 这是首个引入基于AMR的概念熵进行上下文压缩的工作，展示了稳定语言特征在上下文工程中的潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face information overload when handling long contexts, particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) where extensive supporting documents often introduce redundant content. This issue not only weakens reasoning accuracy but also increases computational overhead. We propose an unsupervised context compression framework that exploits Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs to preserve semantically essential information while filtering out irrelevant text. By quantifying node-level entropy within AMR graphs, our method estimates the conceptual importance of each node, enabling the retention of core semantics. Specifically, we construct AMR graphs from raw contexts, compute the conceptual entropy of each node, and screen significant informative nodes to form a condensed and semantically focused context than raw documents. Experiments on the PopQA and EntityQuestions datasets show that our method outperforms vanilla and other baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing context length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work introducing AMR-based conceptual entropy for context compression, demonstrating the potential of stable linguistic features in context engineering.

Motivation: 传统焦点小组数据分析依赖人工编码，存在可扩展性和可重复性限制，需要开发计算框架来克服这些局限。

Method: 使用BERTopic对10个焦点小组的1076条话语进行主题建模，系统评估27种超参数配置，通过30次自举重采样评估稳定性，并由3名领域专家进行人工验证。

Result: 发现模型对超参数选择敏感，分层合并策略在稳定性-连贯性权衡中表现更好（连贯性0.558 vs 0.539），人工验证显示主题质量良好（ICC=0.79，加权Cohen's kappa=0.578）。

Conclusion: 该框架为定性研究提供了实用指南，所有代码和协议已公开，支持复现和扩展。

Abstract: Focus group discussions generate rich qualitative data but their analysis traditionally relies on labor-intensive manual coding that limits scalability and reproducibility. We present a rigorous, reproducible computational framework for applying neural topic modeling to focus group transcripts, addressing fundamental methodological challenges: hyperparameter sensitivity, model stability, and validation of interpretability. Using BERTopic applied to ten focus groups exploring HPV vaccine perceptions in Tunisia (1,076 utterances), we conducted systematic evaluation across 27 hyperparameter configurations, assessed stability through bootstrap resampling with 30 replicates per configuration, and validated interpretability through formal human evaluation by three domain experts. Our analysis demonstrates substantial sensitivity to hyperparameter choices and reveals that metric selection for stability assessment must align with analytical goals. A hierarchical merging strategy (extracting fine-grained topics for stability then consolidating for interpretability) effectively navigates the stability-coherence tradeoff, achieving coherence of 0.558 compared to 0.539 for direct extraction. Human validation confirmed topic quality with very good inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.79, weighted Cohen's kappa = 0.578). Our framework provides practical guidelines that researchers can adapt to their own qualitative research contexts. All code, data processing scripts, and evaluation protocols are publicly available to support reproduction and extension of this work.

Motivation: 捷克语摘要任务，特别是历史文档摘要，由于语言复杂性和缺乏高质量标注数据集而研究不足。

Method: 使用Mistral和mT5等大语言模型，并提出翻译方法：先将捷克文本翻译成英语，用英语模型摘要，再翻译回捷克语。

Result: 在SumeCzech数据集上取得新的最先进结果，并为历史捷克文本创建了新的标注数据集。

Conclusion: 本研究为捷克语摘要任务奠定了基础，为捷克历史文档处理和低资源语言摘要研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Text summarization is the task of automatically condensing longer texts into shorter, coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning and key information. Although this task has been extensively studied in English and other high-resource languages, Czech summarization, particularly in the context of historical documents, remains underexplored. This is largely due to the inherent linguistic complexity of Czech and the lack of high-quality annotated datasets.
  In this work, we address this gap by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Mistral and mT5, which have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and multilingual settings. In addition, we also propose a translation-based approach that first translates Czech texts into English, summarizes them using an English-language model, and then translates the summaries back into Czech. Our study makes the following main contributions: We demonstrate that LLMs achieve new state-of-the-art results on the SumeCzech dataset, a benchmark for modern Czech text summarization, showing the effectiveness of multilingual LLMs even for morphologically rich, medium-resource languages like Czech. We introduce a new dataset, Posel od Čerchova, designed for the summarization of historical Czech texts. This dataset is derived from digitized 19th-century publications and annotated for abstractive summarization. We provide initial baselines using modern LLMs to facilitate further research in this underrepresented area.
  By combining cutting-edge models with both modern and historical Czech datasets, our work lays the foundation for further progress in Czech summarization and contributes valuable resources for future research in Czech historical document processing and low-resource summarization more broadly.

Result: 在A股股票上的实验表明，CogAlpha持续发现具有优越预测准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力的alpha，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 将进化优化与基于LLM的推理相结合，有望实现自动化和可解释的alpha发现。

Abstract: Discovering effective predictive signals, or ``alphas,'' from financial data with high dimensionality and extremely low signal-to-noise ratio remains a difficult open problem. Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods. Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery. All source code will be released.

### [376] [FanarGuard: A Culturally-Aware Moderation Filter for Arabic Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18852)
*Masoomali Fatehkia,Enes Altinisik,Husrev Taha Sencar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FanarGuard是一个双语内容审核过滤器，专门针对阿拉伯语和英语，评估安全性和文化对齐性，在文化敏感性方面表现优于人类标注者间的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容审核过滤器主要关注通用安全性，但忽视了文化背景的重要性，特别是在阿拉伯文化语境中。

Method: 构建了超过468K个提示-响应对数据集，由LLM评委在无害性和文化意识方面评分，训练了两个过滤器变体，并开发了首个针对阿拉伯文化语境的基准测试。

Result: FanarGuard在文化对齐性方面与人类标注的一致性超过了标注者间的一致性，同时在安全性基准测试中与最先进的过滤器性能相当。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将文化意识整合到内容审核中的重要性，FanarGuard是实现更上下文敏感安全防护的实际步骤。

Abstract: Content moderation filters are a critical safeguard against alignment failures in language models. Yet most existing filters focus narrowly on general safety and overlook cultural context. In this work, we introduce FanarGuard, a bilingual moderation filter that evaluates both safety and cultural alignment in Arabic and English. We construct a dataset of over 468K prompt and response pairs, drawn from synthetic and public datasets, scored by a panel of LLM judges on harmlessness and cultural awareness, and use it to train two filter variants. To rigorously evaluate cultural alignment, we further develop the first benchmark targeting Arabic cultural contexts, comprising over 1k norm-sensitive prompts with LLM-generated responses annotated by human raters. Results show that FanarGuard achieves stronger agreement with human annotations than inter-annotator reliability, while matching the performance of state-of-the-art filters on safety benchmarks. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cultural awareness into moderation and establish FanarGuard as a practical step toward more context-sensitive safeguards.

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), the applications of LLMs have grown substantially. In the education domain, LLMs demonstrate significant potential, particularly in automatic text generation, which enables the creation of intelligent and adaptive learning content. This paper proposes a new LLMs framework, which is named as Reading Comprehension Exercise Generation (RCEG). It can generate high-quality and personalized English reading comprehension exercises automatically. Firstly, RCEG uses fine-tuned LLMs to generate content candidates. Then, it uses a discriminator to select the best candidate. Finally, the quality of the generated content has been improved greatly. To evaluate the performance of RCEG, a dedicated dataset for English reading comprehension is constructed to perform the experiments, and comprehensive evaluation metrics are used to analyze the experimental results. These metrics include content diversity, factual accuracy, linguistic toxicity, and pedagogical alignment. Experimental results show that RCEG significantly improves the relevance and cognitive appropriateness of the generated exercises.

TL;DR: 本文首次研究大型推理模型(LRMs)的剪枝问题，发现直接应用现有剪枝技术效果不佳，提出使用自生成推理数据进行校准可显著提升剪枝性能，并设计了选择性自生成推理(SSGR)数据构建策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色，但其长链推理过程导致高昂的推理开销。现有剪枝研究主要集中在大型语言模型上，而LRMs的剪枝尚未被探索。

Method: 提出选择性自生成推理(SSGR)数据构建策略，使用具有挑战性和中等长度的自生成推理数据作为校准数据来优化LRMs的剪枝过程。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill模型系列上的实验表明，相比通用剪枝方法，该策略将剪枝后LRMs的推理能力提升了10%-13%。

Conclusion: 使用精心选择的自生成推理数据作为校准数据是有效剪枝LRMs的关键，挑战性和中等长度的推理数据是最理想的校准数据。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning benchmarks. However, their long chain-of-thought reasoning processes incur significant inference overhead. Pruning has emerged as a promising approach to reducing computational costs. However, existing efforts have primarily focused on large language models (LLMs), while pruning LRMs remains unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first empirical study on pruning LRMs and show that directly applying existing pruning techniques fails to yield satisfactory results. Our findings indicate that using self-generated reasoning data for calibration can substantially improve pruning performance. We further investigate how the difficulty and length of reasoning data affect pruning outcomes. Our analysis reveals that challenging and moderately long self-generated reasoning data serve as ideal calibration data. Based on these insights, we propose a Selective Self-Generated Reasoning (SSGR) data construction strategy to provide effective calibration data for pruning LRMs. Experimental results on the DeepSeek-R1-Distill model series validate that our strategy improves the reasoning ability of pruned LRMs by 10%-13% compared to general pruning methods.

TL;DR: CoreEval是一种抗数据污染的评估策略，通过从GDELT数据库获取最新知识来更新数据，解决LLM评估中的数据污染问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染导致LLM评估不公平，现有方法无法完全消除模型中的预存知识或保持原始数据集的语义复杂性。

Method: 从原始数据提取实体关系，利用GDELT数据库检索最新相关知识，重新语境化并整合知识，通过数据反射机制迭代验证和精炼标签。

Result: 在更新数据集上的广泛实验验证了CoreEval的鲁棒性，有效缓解了数据污染导致的性能高估。

Conclusion: CoreEval提供了一种有效的抗数据污染评估方法，能够生成语义连贯且任务相关性增强的更新数据集。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to the fairness of LLM evaluations in natural language processing tasks by inadvertently exposing models to test data during training. Current studies attempt to mitigate this issue by modifying existing datasets or generating new ones from freshly collected information. However, these methods fall short of ensuring contamination-resilient evaluation, as they fail to fully eliminate pre-existing knowledge from models or preserve the semantic complexity of the original datasets. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{CoreEval}, a \textbf{Co}ntamination-\textbf{re}silient \textbf{Eval}uation strategy for automatically updating data with real-world knowledge. This approach begins by extracting entity relationships from the original data and leveraging the GDELT database to retrieve relevant, up-to-date knowledge. The retrieved knowledge is then recontextualized and integrated with the original data, which is refined and restructured to ensure semantic coherence and enhanced task relevance. Ultimately, a robust data reflection mechanism is employed to iteratively verify and refine labels, ensuring consistency between the updated and original datasets. Extensive experiments on updated datasets validate the robustness of CoreEval, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating performance overestimation caused by data contamination.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究复现了LLAMBO框架，使用Llama 3.1 70B替代GPT-3.5，验证了其核心主张：基于文本描述的上下文预热显著改善早期遗憾行为，语言模型诱导的跨任务语义先验有益于判别式代理模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLAMBO框架在不同语言模型骨干下的鲁棒性和有效性，特别是使用开源模型Llama 3.1 70B替代GPT-3.5后的表现。

Method: 在原始评估协议下复现核心Bayesmark和HPOBench实验，使用Llama 3.1 70B模型进行所有文本编码组件，并进行消融实验分析各组件贡献。

Result: LLAMBO架构对语言模型骨干更换具有鲁棒性，上下文预热显著改善早期遗憾行为和降低方差，判别式代理虽弱于GP或SMAC但受益于跨任务语义先验，候选采样器生成更高质量和多样化的提议。

Conclusion: LLAMBO架构在使用Llama 3.1 70B时仍保持有效，证明了该方法的通用性和鲁棒性，但较小模型容量不足导致预测不稳定。

Abstract: In this reproducibility study, we revisit the LLAMBO framework of Daxberger et al. (2024), a prompting-based Bayesian optimization (BO) method that uses large language models as discriminative surrogates and acquisition optimizers via text-only interactions. We replicate the core Bayesmark and HPOBench experiments under the original evaluation protocol, but replace GPT-3.5 with the open-weight Llama 3.1 70B model used for all text encoding components.
  Our results broadly confirm the main claims of LLAMBO. Contextual warm starting via textual problem and hyperparameter descriptions substantially improves early regret behaviour and reduces variance across runs. LLAMBO's discriminative surrogate is weaker than GP or SMAC as a pure single task regressor, yet benefits from cross task semantic priors induced by the language model. Ablations that remove textual context markedly degrade predictive accuracy and calibration, while the LLAMBO candidate sampler consistently generates higher quality and more diverse proposals than TPE or random sampling. Experiments with smaller backbones (Gemma 27B, Llama 3.1 8B) yield unstable or invalid predictions, suggesting insufficient capacity for reliable surrogate behaviour.
  Overall, our study shows that the LLAMBO architecture is robust to changing the language model backbone and remains effective when instantiated with Llama 3.1 70B.

*Sahil Kale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在需要时是否有效使用网络搜索的基准测试，发现网络搜索能提高准确性但存在置信度校准问题，模型在需要搜索时经常跳过检索，且搜索查询质量不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估现代大语言模型是否能在需要时有效使用网络搜索，以及它们是否能基于内部置信度正确决定何时需要搜索。

Method: 构建包含静态和动态问题的基准数据集：783个预截止日期可回答的问题测试基于低置信度的搜索调用，288个截止日期后的问题测试识别搜索需求的能力。

Result: 网络搜索显著提高GPT-5-mini和Claude Haiku 4.5的静态准确性，但置信度校准变差。动态查询中模型频繁调用搜索但准确率低于70%，主要由于查询质量差。

Conclusion: 内置网络搜索能有效提高事实准确性并可作为低延迟验证层，但模型仍存在过度自信、在需要时跳过检索以及初始搜索查询失败后表现不佳的问题。

Abstract: Modern large language models integrate web search to provide real-time answers, yet it remains unclear whether they are efficiently calibrated to use search when it is actually needed. We introduce a benchmark evaluating both the necessity and effectiveness of web access across commercial models with no access to internal states or parameters. The dataset includes a static split of 783 temporally anchored questions answerable from pre-cutoff knowledge, aimed at testing whether models invoke search based on low internal confidence, and a dynamic split of 288 post-cutoff queries designed to test whether models recognise when search is required and retrieve updated information. Web access substantially improves static accuracy for GPT-5-mini and Claude Haiku 4.5, though confidence calibration worsens. On dynamic queries, both models frequently invoke search yet remain below 70 percent accuracy due to weak query formulation. Costs per accuracy-improving call remain low, but returns diminish once initial retrieval fails. Selective invocation helps, but models become overconfident and inconsistent after search. Overall, built-in web search meaningfully improves factual accuracy and can be invoked selectively, yet models remain overconfident, skip retrieval when it is essential, and falter once initial search queries underperform. Taken together, internal web search works better as a good low-latency verification layer than a reliable analytical tool, with clear room for improvement.

Motivation: 现有研究通常只关注单一查询语言，导致方法在不同语言间的泛化能力有限。本文旨在统一不同查询语言的语义解析任务，提高方法的通用性。

Method: 提出Text-to-Query任务范式，识别查询骨架作为共享优化目标，开发动态数据增强框架来诊断模型在查询骨架处理上的弱点，并合成针对性训练数据。

Result: 在四个Text-to-Query基准测试中，仅使用少量合成数据就达到了最先进的性能，证明了方法的效率和通用性。

Conclusion: 该方法为Text-to-Query任务的统一研究奠定了坚实基础，通过查询骨架和动态数据增强实现了跨查询语言的高效语义解析。

Abstract: The task of translating natural language questions into query languages has long been a central focus in semantic parsing. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly accelerated progress in this field. However, existing studies typically focus on a single query language, resulting in methods with limited generalizability across different languages. In this paper, we formally define the Text-to-Query task paradigm, unifying semantic parsing tasks across various query languages. We identify query skeletons as a shared optimization target of Text-to-Query tasks, and propose a general dynamic data augmentation framework that explicitly diagnoses model-specific weaknesses in handling these skeletons to synthesize targeted training data. Experiments on four Text-to-Query benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a small amount of synthesized data, highlighting the efficiency and generality of our approach and laying a solid foundation for unified research on Text-to-Query tasks. We release our code at https://github.com/jjjycaptain/Skeletron.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图形化知识的方法来审查临床试验中的治疗相关不良事件，通过为MedDRA添加隐藏的医学知识层(Safeterm)来改进不良事件分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的不良事件分析方法缺乏语义理解，需要增强MedDRA术语系统以更好地捕捉不良事件之间的语义关系，提高临床试验安全性评估的清晰度、效率和准确性。

Method: 在MedDRA基础上添加隐藏的医学知识层(Safeterm)，构建2D语义地图；使用收缩发病率比计算治疗特异性不成比例指标；通过精度加权聚合推导聚类级EBGM值；提供两种可视化输出：显示AE发病率的语义地图和用于快速信号检测的期望度-不成比例度图。

Result: 在三个历史试验中应用，自动化方法清晰地恢复了所有预期的安全信号。

Conclusion: 通过为MedDRA添加医学知识层，显著提高了临床试验中不良事件解释的清晰度、效率和准确性。

Abstract: We present a graphical, knowledge-based method for reviewing treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials. The approach enhances MedDRA by adding a hidden medical knowledge layer (Safeterm) that captures semantic relationships between terms in a 2-D map. Using this layer, AE Preferred Terms can be regrouped automatically into similarity clusters, and their association to the trial disease may be quantified. The Safeterm map is available online and connected to aggregated AE incidence tables from ClinicalTrials.gov. For signal detection, we compute treatment-specific disproportionality metrics using shrinkage incidence ratios. Cluster-level EBGM values are then derived through precision-weighted aggregation. Two visual outputs support interpretation: a semantic map showing AE incidence and an expectedness-versus-disproportionality plot for rapid signal detection. Applied to three legacy trials, the automated method clearly recovers all expected safety signals. Overall, augmenting MedDRA with a medical knowledge layer improves clarity, efficiency, and accuracy in AE interpretation for clinical trials.

Motivation: 寻找与自然语言分离的情感表达形式，作为情感状态的代理或窗口，补充自然语言的表达局限。

Method: 建立"矛盾结构效应"的动态表达形式，通过蒙太奇操作重叠多个效应，形成包含相关效应的"结构"，并引入德勒兹的"强度"概念作为模型要素。

Result: 构建了一个通用的理论框架——系统间词语导入，通过奥斯汀的"力量"一词的使用证明了"强度"概念的导入合理性。

Conclusion: 提出的情感表达模型能够有效补充自然语言，通过矛盾结构和蒙太奇操作产生结构效应，为情感表达提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: In expressing emotions, as an expression form separate from natural language, we propose an alternative form that complements natural language, acting as a proxy or window for emotional states. First, we set up an expression form "Effect of Contradictory Structure." "Effect of Contradictory Structure" is not static but dynamic. Effect in "Effect of Contradictory Structure" is unpleasant or pleasant, and the orientation to avoid that unpleasantness is considered pseudo-expression of will. Second, "Effect of Contradictory Structure" can be overlapped with each other. This overlapping operation is called "montage." A broader "Structure" that includes related "Effect of Contradictory Structure" and "Effect of Structure" are set up. Montage produces "Effect of Structure". In montage, it is necessary to set something like "strength," so we adopted Deleuze and Deleuze/Guattari's word "intensity" and set it as an element of our model. We set up a general theoretical framework - Word Import Between Systems (Models) and justified the import of "intensity" through Austin's use of the word "force." "Effect of Structure" process is demonstrated using the example of proceeding to the next level of education.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, including multi-step reasoning such as mathematical proving. However, existing approaches often lack an explicit and dynamic mechanism to structurally represent and evolve intermediate reasoning states, which limits their ability to perform context-aware theorem selection and iterative conclusion generation. To address these challenges, we propose GraphMind, a novel dynamic graph-based framework that integrates the graph neural network (GNN) with LLMs to iteratively select theorems and generate intermediate conclusions for multi-step reasoning. Our method models the reasoning process as a heterogeneous evolving graph, where nodes represent conditions, theorems, and conclusions, while edges capture logical dependencies between nodes. By encoding the current reasoning state with GNN and leveraging semantic matching for theorem selection, our framework enables context-aware, interpretable, and structured reasoning in a closed-loop manner. Experiments on various question-answering (QA) datasets demonstrate that our proposed GraphMind method achieves consistent performance improvements and significantly outperforms existing baselines in multi-step reasoning, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Method: 提出KDR-Agent多智能体框架，利用自然语言类型定义和静态实体级对比演示，通过中央规划器协调专门智能体进行知识检索、消歧和反思分析。

Conclusion: KDR-Agent通过整合知识检索、消歧和反思分析，有效提升了低资源场景下多领域命名实体识别的性能。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) with large language models (LLMs) has emerged as a promising paradigm for named entity recognition (NER) in low-resource scenarios. However, existing ICL-based NER methods suffer from three key limitations: (1) reliance on dynamic retrieval of annotated examples, which is problematic when annotated data is scarce; (2) limited generalization to unseen domains due to the LLM's insufficient internal domain knowledge; and (3) failure to incorporate external knowledge or resolve entity ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose KDR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for multi-domain low-resource in-context NER that integrates Knowledge retrieval, Disambiguation, and Reflective analysis. KDR-Agent leverages natural-language type definitions and a static set of entity-level contrastive demonstrations to reduce dependency on large annotated corpora. A central planner coordinates specialized agents to (i) retrieve factual knowledge from Wikipedia for domain-specific mentions, (ii) resolve ambiguous entities via contextualized reasoning, and (iii) reflect on and correct model predictions through structured self-assessment. Experiments across ten datasets from five domains demonstrate that KDR-Agent significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and few-shot ICL baselines across multiple LLM backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在思维链推理中存在两个关键限制：一是作为黑盒提供未区分的奖励信号，难以诊断错误；二是顺序解码具有O(n)时间复杂度，使得复杂推理任务的实时部署不切实际。

Method: DeCoRL训练轻量级专用模型并行生成推理子步骤，通过并行处理消除顺序瓶颈。设计了模块化奖励函数独立评分每个子步骤，并使用级联DRPO优化协调这些奖励同时保持步骤间依赖关系。

Result: 在RM-Bench、RMB和RewardBench上的综合评估显示，DeCoRL取得了最先进的结果，优于包括大规模模型在内的现有方法。推理速度提升3.8倍，可解释性提高22.7%，能耗降低72.4%，吞吐量增加68%。

Conclusion: DeCoRL通过并行处理、模块化奖励和级联优化，实现了复杂推理系统的实时部署，在性能、效率和可解释性方面均有显著提升。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning methods for Chain-of-Thought reasoning suffer from two critical limitations. First, they operate as monolithic black boxes that provide undifferentiated reward signals, obscuring individual step contributions and hindering error diagnosis. Second, sequential decoding has O(n) time complexity. This makes real-time deployment impractical for complex reasoning tasks. We present DeCoRL (Decoupled Reasoning Chains via Coordinated Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that transforms reasoning from sequential processing into collaborative modular orchestration. DeCoRL trains lightweight specialized models to generate reasoning sub-steps concurrently, eliminating sequential bottlenecks through parallel processing. To enable precise error attribution, the framework designs modular reward functions that score each sub-step independently. Cascaded DRPO optimization then coordinates these rewards while preserving inter-step dependencies. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art results across RM-Bench, RMB, and RewardBench, outperforming existing methods including large-scale models. DeCoRL delivers 3.8 times faster inference while maintaining superior solution quality and offers a 22.7\% improvement in interpretability through explicit reward attribution. These advancements, combined with a 72.4\% reduction in energy consumption and a 68\% increase in throughput, make real-time deployment of complex reasoning systems a reality.

Our automatic unification algorithm implements linguistic rules in symbolic regular expressions. We also present a manual evaluation protocol that we have proposed and implemented to assess the quality of the unified sentences generated by our algorithm, by testing in a sentence semantic task. We have obtained encouraging results from the evaluators for most of the desired features of our artificially unified sentences

Prior work capitalizes on information theory to formalize these notions; however, these studies generally rely on two simplifications: (i) optimal listeners, and (ii) universal communicative need across languages. Here, we address these limitations by introducing an information-theoretic framework for discrete object naming systems, and we use it to prove that an optimal trade-off is achievable if and only if the listener's decoder is equivalent to the Bayesian decoder of the speaker. Adopting a referential game setup from emergent communication, and focusing on the semantic domain of kinship, we show that our notion of optimality is not only theoretically achievable but also emerges empirically in learned communication systems.

### [390] [Emotion-Enhanced Multi-Task Learning with LLMs for Aspect Category Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19122)
*Yaping Chai,Haoran Xie,Joe S. Qin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种情感增强的多任务ACSA框架，联合学习情感极性和基于Ekman六种基本情绪的分类别情感，通过VAD框架的情绪优化机制提升生成情绪的准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ACSA方法主要关注情感极性，忽略了塑造情感表达的基础情绪维度，这限制了模型捕捉针对特定方面类别的细粒度情感信号的能力。

Method: 利用LLM的生成能力，为每个方面类别生成情感描述，并通过基于VAD维度的情绪优化机制确保生成情绪的准确性和一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在所有基准数据集上都显著优于强基线模型。

Conclusion: 将情感维度整合到ACSA中是有效的，能够丰富情感表示并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Aspect category sentiment analysis (ACSA) has achieved remarkable progress with large language models (LLMs), yet existing approaches primarily emphasize sentiment polarity while overlooking the underlying emotional dimensions that shape sentiment expressions. This limitation hinders the model's ability to capture fine-grained affective signals toward specific aspect categories. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel emotion-enhanced multi-task ACSA framework that jointly learns sentiment polarity and category-specific emotions grounded in Ekman's six basic emotions. Leveraging the generative capabilities of LLMs, our approach enables the model to produce emotional descriptions for each aspect category, thereby enriching sentiment representations with affective expressions. Furthermore, to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the generated emotions, we introduce an emotion refinement mechanism based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) dimensional framework. Specifically, emotions predicted by the LLM are projected onto a VAD space, and those inconsistent with their corresponding VAD coordinates are re-annotated using a structured LLM-based refinement strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines on all benchmark datasets. This underlines the effectiveness of integrating affective dimensions into ACSA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率条件生成的新型隐藏状态操纵方法，通过优化问题平衡似然性和先验正则化，从基础LLMs中激发思维链推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础LLMs在预训练后缺乏专门的推理训练，现有隐藏状态操纵方法存在刚性约束、分布偏移和文本质量下降等问题。

Method: 将挑战重新表述为具有平衡似然性和先验正则化框架的优化问题，引导隐藏状态朝向推理导向的轨迹，同时保持语言连贯性。

Result: 在数学、常识和逻辑推理基准测试中，该方法持续优于现有的引导方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为基础LLMs增强推理能力提供了一个理论上有原则且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is a critical capability for large language models (LLMs), enabling them to tackle com- plex multi-step tasks. While base LLMs, pre-trained on general text corpora, often struggle with reasoning due to a lack of specialized training, recent studies reveal their latent reason- ing potential tied to hidden states. However, existing hidden state manipulation methods, such as linear activation steering, suffer from limitations due to their rigid and unconstrained nature, often leading to distribution shifts and degraded text quality. In this work, we propose a novel approach for elic- iting CoT reasoning from base LLMs through hidden state manipulation grounded in probabilistic conditional generation. By reformulating the challenge as an optimization problem with a balanced likelihood and prior regularization framework, our method guides hidden states toward reasoning-oriented trajectories while preserving linguistic coherence. Extensive evaluations across mathematical, commonsense, and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach con- sistently outperforms existing steering methods, offering a theoretically principled and effective solution for enhancing reasoning capabilities in base LLMs.

*Samantha Dies,Courtney Maynard,Germans Savcisens,Tina Eliassi-Rad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究引入表征稳定性概念，评估LLM内部真实性表示对真理定义扰动的鲁棒性，发现LLM对虚构内容的真实性判断比未知实体更稳定，表明稳定性源于认知熟悉度而非语言形式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM如何在其内部概率表示中稳定地区分真实、虚假和既非真实也非虚假的内容，以及这些表示对真理定义变化的鲁棒性。

Method: 通过在线性探针上训练LLM激活来分离真实与非真实陈述，并在受控标签变化下测量学习决策边界的变化，使用16个开源模型和3个事实领域进行比较。

Result: 未知实体陈述引发最大边界偏移（在脆弱领域如单词定义中达40%真实性判断翻转），而熟悉虚构陈述保持更一致聚类且变化较小（≤8.2%）。

Conclusion: 表征稳定性更多源于认知熟悉度而非语言形式，该方法为审计和训练LLM提供了诊断工具，以在语义不确定性下保持一致性真理分配。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used for factual tasks such as "What treats asthma?" or "What is the capital of Latvia?". However, it remains unclear how stably LLMs encode distinctions between true, false, and neither-true-nor-false content in their internal probabilistic representations. We introduce representational stability as the robustness of an LLM's veracity representations to perturbations in the operational definition of truth. We assess representational stability by (i) training a linear probe on an LLM's activations to separate true from not-true statements and (ii) measuring how its learned decision boundary shifts under controlled label changes. Using activations from sixteen open-source models and three factual domains, we compare two types of neither statements. The first are fact-like assertions about entities we believe to be absent from any training data. We call these unfamiliar neither statements. The second are nonfactual claims drawn from well-known fictional contexts. We call these familiar neither statements. The unfamiliar statements induce the largest boundary shifts, producing up to $40\%$ flipped truth judgements in fragile domains (such as word definitions), while familiar fictional statements remain more coherently clustered and yield smaller changes ($\leq 8.2\%$). These results suggest that representational stability stems more from epistemic familiarity than from linguistic form. More broadly, our approach provides a diagnostic for auditing and training LLMs to preserve coherent truth assignments under semantic uncertainty, rather than optimizing for output accuracy alone.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探索transformer模型如何检测语义异常句子，通过分析phi-2模型在不同层对合理与不合理句子结尾的编码方式，发现语义异常检测在模型中层达到峰值，与人类阅读中语义异常检测发生在句法解析之后的发现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索transformer模型如何以及在哪一层检测到句子语义异常，以理解模型内部处理语义信息的过程。

Method: 使用phi-2因果语言模型，分析合理与不合理句子结尾的隐藏状态，采用线性探测器和有效维度分析两种互补方法。

Result: 线性探测器在模型底层难以区分语义异常，中层检测准确率急剧上升达到峰值；语义异常编码先扩展表示子空间，然后在中层瓶颈后收缩，表明从探索阶段过渡到快速整合阶段。

Conclusion: transformer模型检测语义异常的模式与人类阅读中语义异常检测发生在句法解析之后的心理语言学发现相一致。

Abstract: How and where does a transformer notice that a sentence has gone semantically off the rails? To explore this question, we evaluated the causal language model (phi-2) using a carefully curated corpus, with sentences that concluded plausibly or implausibly. Our analysis focused on the hidden states sampled at each model layer. To investigate how violations are encoded, we utilized two complementary probes. First, we conducted a per-layer detection using a linear probe. Our findings revealed that a simple linear decoder struggled to distinguish between plausible and implausible endings in the lowest third of the model's layers. However, its accuracy sharply increased in the middle blocks, reaching a peak just before the top layers. Second, we examined the effective dimensionality of the encoded violation. Initially, the violation widens the representational subspace, followed by a collapse after a mid-stack bottleneck. This might indicate an exploratory phase that transitions into rapid consolidation. Taken together, these results contemplate the idea of alignment with classical psycholinguistic findings in human reading, where semantic anomalies are detected only after syntactic resolution, occurring later in the online processing sequence.

Method: 从Cinegolpo博客、Samakal和The Business Standard报纸等多个来源收集数据，使用LSTM、BanglaT5-small和MTS-small等深度学习模型进行训练和评估。

Result: 建立了强大的基线模型，展示了该数据集作为孟加拉语自然语言处理未来研究基准的潜力。

Conclusion: 该数据集为构建鲁棒的摘要系统提供了坚实基础，有助于扩展低资源语言的NLP资源。

Abstract: This study developed a new Bangla abstractive summarization dataset to generate concise summaries of Bangla articles from diverse sources. Most existing studies in this field have concentrated on news articles, where journalists usually follow a fixed writing style. While such approaches are effective in limited contexts, they often fail to adapt to the varied nature of real-world Bangla texts. In today's digital era, a massive amount of Bangla content is continuously produced across blogs, newspapers, and social media. This creates a pressing need for summarization systems that can reduce information overload and help readers understand content more quickly. To address this challenge, we developed a dataset of over 54,000 Bangla articles and summaries collected from multiple sources, including blogs such as Cinegolpo and newspapers such as Samakal and The Business Standard. Unlike single-domain resources, our dataset spans multiple domains and writing styles. It offers greater adaptability and practical relevance. To establish strong baselines, we trained and evaluated this dataset using several deep learning and transfer learning models, including LSTM, BanglaT5-small, and MTS-small. The results highlight its potential as a benchmark for future research in Bangla natural language processing. This dataset provides a solid foundation for building robust summarization systems and helps expand NLP resources for low-resource languages.

Conclusion: 评估了不同来源的推理轨迹数据对中等规模模型推理能力训练的效果，为高效训练推理模型提供了参考。

Abstract: Test-time scaling, which leverages additional computation during inference to improve model accuracy, has enabled a new class of Large Language Models (LLMs) that are able to reason through complex problems by understanding the goal, turning this goal into a plan, working through intermediate steps, and checking their own work before answering . Frontier large language models with reasoning capabilities, such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI's gpt-oss, follow the same procedure when solving complex problems by generating intermediate reasoning traces before giving the final answer. Today, these models are being increasingly used to generate reasoning traces that serve as high-quality supervised data for post-training of small and medium-sized language models to teach reasoning capabilities without requiring expensive human curation. In this work, we compare the performance of medium-sized LLMs on Math problems after post-training on two kinds of reasoning traces. We compare the impact of reasoning traces generated by DeepSeek-R1 and gpt-oss LLMs in terms of accuracy and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: RLER方法有效解决了长格式深度研究的训练挑战，开发出的DR Tulu模型在多个领域表现出色，为未来研究提供了数据、模型和代码资源。

Abstract: Deep research models perform multi-step research to produce long-form, well-attributed answers. However, most open deep research models are trained on easily verifiable short-form QA tasks via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which does not extend to realistic long-form tasks. We address this with Reinforcement Learning with Evolving Rubrics (RLER), in which we construct and maintain rubrics that co-evolve with the policy model during training; this allows the rubrics to incorporate information that the model has newly explored and to provide discriminative, on-policy feedback. Using RLER, we develop Deep Research Tulu (DR Tulu-8B), the first open model that is directly trained for open-ended, long-form deep research. Across four long-form deep research benchmarks in science, healthcare and general domains, DR Tulu substantially outperforms existing open deep research models, and matches or exceeds proprietary deep research systems, while being significantly smaller and cheaper per query. To facilitate future research, we release all data, models, and code, including our new MCP-based agent infrastructure for deep research systems.

Motivation: 现有方法需要开发成本高昂的大规模视觉语言模型来扩展LLMs的多模态能力，而较小的VLMs虽然高效但缺乏前沿LLMs的广泛知识和推理能力。

Method: 提出模块化多智能体框架，通过对话协调感知器和推理器的协作；引入数据合成和监督微调管道来训练感知器智能体与推理器有效协作。

Result: 实验表明该框架解锁了LLMs的多模态推理能力，使用轻量级开源解决方案（DeepSeek-R1 + Qwen2.5-VL-7B）在知识密集型多模态任务上超越了GPT-4o等大规模专有VLMs。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了构建未来多模态推理系统的有效性、模块化和可扩展性，结合了感知和推理智能体的互补优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in challenging, knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks. However, extending LLMs to perceive and reason over a new modality (e.g., vision), often requires costly development of large-scale vision language models (VLMs) with LLMs as backbones. Smaller VLMs are more efficient and adaptable but often lack the broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities of frontier LLMs. In this work, we propose BeMyEyes, a modular, multi-agent framework for extending LLMs to multimodal reasoning by orchestrating collaboration between efficient, adaptable VLMs as perceivers and powerful LLMs as reasoners through conversations. We then introduce a data synthesis and supervised fine-tuning pipeline to train the perceiver agent to effectively collaborate with the reasoner agent. By combining the complementary strengths of perception and reasoning agents, BeMyEyes avoids the need for training large-scale multimodal models, preserves the generalization and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, and allows flexible extension to new domains and modalities. Experiments show that our framework unlocks the multimodal reasoning capabilities for LLMs, enabling a lightweight and fully open-source solution, i.e. equipping text-only DeepSeek-R1 with Qwen2.5-VL-7B perceiver, to outperform large-scale proprietary VLMs such as GPT-4o on a wide range of knowledge-intensive multimodal tasks. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, modularity, and scalability of our multi-agent approach for building future multimodal reasoning systems.

Motivation: 为人工智能记忆系统开发一个数学严谨、哲学基础扎实的评估框架，将莱布尼茨的形而上学概念转化为可操作的信息论指标。

Method: 将《单子论》的20个核心命题映射到信息论架构中，每个单子作为模块化单元，包含真值分数、冗余参数和记忆惩罚函数贡献，使用平滑对数变换操作化这些量。

Result: 建立了可解释、有界的记忆老化、表征稳定性和显著性度量，将形而上学概念重新表述为熵、梯度动态和内部表征保真度，并提供了关于精炼不变性、结构可分解性和尺度变换单调性的形式证明。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了评估工具，还为构建模块化、可解释且可证明正确的人工智能记忆架构提供了原则性蓝图。

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematically rigorous, philosophically grounded framework for evaluating artificial memory systems, rooted in the metaphysical structure of Leibniz's Monadology. Building on a previously formalized metric, the Artificial Age Score (AAS), the study maps twenty core propositions from the Monadology to an information-theoretic architecture. In this design, each monad functions as a modular unit defined by a truth score, a redundancy parameter, and a weighted contribution to a global memory penalty function. Smooth logarithmic transformations operationalize these quantities and yield interpretable, bounded metrics for memory aging, representational stability, and salience. Classical metaphysical notions of perception, apperception, and appetition are reformulated as entropy, gradient dynamics, and internal representation fidelity. Logical principles, including the laws of non-contradiction and sufficient reason, are encoded as regularization constraints guiding memory evolution. A central contribution is a set of first principles proofs establishing refinement invariance, structural decomposability, and monotonicity under scale transformation, aligned with the metaphysical structure of monads. The framework's formal organization is structured into six thematic bundles derived from Monadology, aligning each mathematical proof with its corresponding philosophical domain. Beyond evaluation, the framework offers a principled blueprint for building Al memory architectures that are modular, interpretable, and provably sound.

Conclusion: 该方法为使用GAN保留空间拓扑特征的建筑设计和城市更新应用提供了理论基础和数据支持，检测模块可广泛用于定制具有相同拓扑结构的图像数据集和批量检测图像拓扑关系。

Abstract: Taking into account the regional characteristics of intrinsic and extrinsic properties of space is an essential issue in architectural design and urban renewal, which is often achieved step by step using image and graph-based GANs. However, each model nesting and data conversion may cause information loss, and it is necessary to streamline the tools to facilitate architects and users to participate in the design. Therefore, this study hopes to prove that I2I GAN also has the potential to recognize topological relationships autonomously. Therefore, this research proposes a method for quickly detecting the ability of pix2pix to learn topological relationships, which is achieved by adding two Grasshopper-based detection modules before and after GAN. At the same time, quantitative data is provided and its learning process is visualized, and changes in different input modes such as greyscale and RGB affect its learning efficiency. There are two innovations in this paper: 1) It proves that pix2pix can automatically learn spatial topological relationships and apply them to architectural design. 2) It fills the gap in detecting the performance of Image-based Generation GAN from a topological perspective. Moreover, the detection method proposed in this study takes a short time and is simple to operate. The two detection modules can be widely used for customizing image datasets with the same topological structure and for batch detection of topological relationships of images. In the future, this paper may provide a theoretical foundation and data support for the application of architectural design and urban renewal that use GAN to preserve spatial topological characteristics.

Conclusion: 这是首个完全基于推理的对抗AIGC视觉欺骗的框架，通过注入怀疑能有效提升模型对视觉输入真实性的验证能力

Abstract: As the development of AI-generated contents (AIGC), multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) struggle to identify generated visual inputs from real ones. Such shortcoming causes vulnerability against visual deceptions, where the models are deceived by generated contents, and the reliability of reasoning processes is jeopardized. Therefore, facing rapidly emerging generative models and diverse data distribution, it is of vital importance to improve LLMs' generalizable reasoning to verify the authenticity of visual inputs against potential deceptions. Inspired by human cognitive processes, we discovered that LLMs exhibit tendency of over-trusting the visual inputs, while injecting skepticism could significantly improve the models visual cognitive capability against visual deceptions. Based on this discovery, we propose \textbf{Inception}, a fully reasoning-based agentic reasoning framework to conduct generalizable authenticity verification by injecting skepticism, where LLMs' reasoning logic is iteratively enhanced between External Skeptic and Internal Skeptic agents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully reasoning-based framework against AIGC visual deceptions. Our approach achieved a large margin of performance improvement over the strongest existing LLM baselines and SOTA performance on AEGIS benchmark.

Conclusion: 通过连接专家系统原理与现代LLM能力，为可靠、可解释和可治理的AI智能体提供了实用且理论基础的路径。

Abstract: Large language model agents suffer from fundamental architectural problems: entangled reasoning and execution, memory volatility, and uncontrolled action sequences. We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). At the core of SCL is Soft Symbolic Control, an adaptive governance mechanism that applies symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, preserving neural flexibility while restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.

Conclusion: 通过将认知和价值精炼统一在单一形式化框架下，拓宽了理性选择的概念基础，阐明了伦理审议的规范地位。

Abstract: Standard decision frameworks addresses uncertainty about facts but assumes fixed values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yields Pareto-improving Nash bargains. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement and its associated benefits.

*Yang Zhou,Mingyu Zhao,Zhenting Wang,Difei Gu,Bangwei Guo,Ruosong Ye,Ligong Han,Can Jin,Dimitris N. Metaxas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: M^3-Bench是首个基于模型上下文协议评估多模态工具使用的基准，专注于需要视觉基础和文本推理的多跳多线程工作流，包含28个服务器和231个工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏评估多模态工具使用的标准化基准，特别是针对需要跨工具依赖和中间资源持久性的复杂工作流。

Method: 采用相似性驱动的对齐方法，序列化工具调用，使用句子编码器嵌入签名，并通过相似性分桶的匈牙利匹配获得可审计的一对一对应关系。

Result: 评估代表性最先进的多模态大语言模型显示，在多模态MCP工具使用方面存在持续差距，特别是在参数保真度和结构一致性方面。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够联合推理图像、文本和工具图的方法，以改进多模态工具使用能力。

Abstract: We present M^3-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal tool use under the Model Context Protocol. The benchmark targets realistic, multi-hop and multi-threaded workflows that require visual grounding and textual reasoning, cross-tool dependencies, and persistence of intermediate resources across steps. We introduce a similarity-driven alignment that serializes each tool call, embeds signatures with a sentence encoder, and performs similarity-bucketed Hungarian matching to obtain auditable one-to-one correspondences. On top of this alignment, we report interpretable metrics that decouple semantic fidelity from workflow consistency. The benchmark spans 28 servers with 231 tools, and provides standardized trajectories curated through an Executor & Judge pipeline with human verification; an auxiliary four large language models (LLMs) judge ensemble reports end-task Task Completion and information grounding. Evaluations of representative state-of-the-art Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) reveal persistent gaps in multimodal MCP tool use, particularly in argument fidelity and structure consistency, underscoring the need for methods that jointly reason over images, text, and tool graphs.

TL;DR: 本文综述了将传统FMEA转变为智能、数据驱动和语义丰富过程的先进方法，重点探讨AI技术和本体论在自动化失效预测、知识提取和语义推理方面的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着工程系统日益复杂，传统FMEA方法（手动、文档中心、依赖专家）已无法满足现代系统工程需求，需要更智能、自动化的解决方案。

Method: 整合人工智能技术（机器学习、自然语言处理）和本体论，开发混合方法如本体通知学习和大语言模型集成，实现失效预测自动化和语义推理。

Result: AI和本体论能够将FMEA转变为动态、数据驱动、智能且模型集成的过程，提高可追溯性和跨领域互操作性，增强可解释性和自动化水平。

Conclusion: 通过结合AI、系统工程和知识表示，为在智能、知识丰富的工程环境中嵌入FMEA提供了结构化路线图，但仍面临数据质量、可解释性、标准化等挑战。

Abstract: This article presents a state-of-the-art review of recent advances aimed at transforming traditional Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) into a more intelligent, data-driven, and semantically enriched process. As engineered systems grow in complexity, conventional FMEA methods, largely manual, document-centric, and expert-dependent, have become increasingly inadequate for addressing the demands of modern systems engineering. We examine how techniques from Artificial Intelligence (AI), including machine learning and natural language processing, can transform FMEA into a more dynamic, data-driven, intelligent, and model-integrated process by automating failure prediction, prioritisation, and knowledge extraction from operational data. In parallel, we explore the role of ontologies in formalising system knowledge, supporting semantic reasoning, improving traceability, and enabling cross-domain interoperability. The review also synthesises emerging hybrid approaches, such as ontology-informed learning and large language model integration, which further enhance explainability and automation. These developments are discussed within the broader context of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) and function modelling, showing how AI and ontologies can support more adaptive and resilient FMEA workflows. We critically analyse a range of tools, case studies, and integration strategies, while identifying key challenges related to data quality, explainability, standardisation, and interdisciplinary adoption. By leveraging AI, systems engineering, and knowledge representation using ontologies, this review offers a structured roadmap for embedding FMEA within intelligent, knowledge-rich engineering environments.

*Yunsheng Bai,Haoxing Ren*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GROVE是一个分层知识管理框架，通过学习可重用的调试专业知识并将其组织成LLM管理的知识树来解决断言失败问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调试是现代硬件验证中的主要成本，断言失败是最常见且解决成本最高的问题之一。虽然LLM显示出潜力，但它们往往无法捕捉工程师应用的精确、可重用专业知识，导致响应不准确。

Method: GROVE从先前的案例中提炼调试知识，并将其组织成可配置深度的垂直树结构，每个节点编码简洁的知识项和明确的适用条件。在训练时使用并行、无梯度的循环，LLM通过从案例中学习提出结构化的JSON编辑来修改树。测试时执行预算感知的迭代缩放来导航树，检索少量适用的知识项来指导基础LLM的假设生成和修复建议。

Result: 在断言失败案例套件上的评估显示，GROVE在pass@1和pass@5上实现了一致的增益。

Conclusion: GROVE证明了结构化知识演进的价值，能够有效组织和重用调试专业知识来解决硬件验证中的断言失败问题。

Abstract: Debugging is the dominant cost in modern hardware verification, where assertion failures are among the most frequent and expensive to resolve. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise, they often fail to capture the precise, reusable expertise that engineers apply, leading to inaccurate responses. We propose GROVE, a hierarchical knowledge management framework that learns and organizes reusable debugging expertise into an LLM-organized knowledge tree for solving assertion failures. GROVE distills debugging knowledge from prior cases and organizes it into a vertical tree of configurable depth, with each node encoding a concise knowledge item and explicit applicability conditions. During training, GROVE uses a parallel, gradient-free loop where an LLM proposes tree modifications as structured JSON edits by learning from the cases. At test time, a budget-aware iterative zoom is performed to navigate the tree, retrieving a small set of applicable knowledge items that guide a base LLM's hypothesis generation and fix proposals. Evaluated on a suite of assertion-failure cases, GROVE delivers consistent gains in pass@1 and pass@5, demonstrating the value of structured knowledge evolution.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: QuickLAP是一个贝叶斯框架，融合物理和语言反馈来实时推断奖励函数，通过LLM提取奖励特征注意力掩码和偏好变化，在自动驾驶模拟器中比仅使用物理反馈的基线方法减少70%以上的奖励学习误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人需要从人类的行为和语言中学习，但单一模态往往不完整：物理修正有基础但意图模糊，语言表达高级目标但缺乏物理基础。

Method: 将语言视为对用户潜在偏好的概率观察，使用LLM从自由形式话语中提取奖励特征注意力掩码和偏好变化，并与物理反馈集成在闭式更新规则中。

Result: 在半自动驾驶模拟器中，QuickLAP相比仅使用物理反馈和启发式多模态基线方法，减少了70%以上的奖励学习误差。15名参与者的用户研究证实该方法更易理解和协作。

Conclusion: QuickLAP实现了快速、实时、鲁棒的奖励学习，能够处理模糊反馈，用户更喜欢其学习到的行为。

Abstract: Robots must learn from both what people do and what they say, but either modality alone is often incomplete: physical corrections are grounded but ambiguous in intent, while language expresses high-level goals but lacks physical grounding. We introduce QuickLAP: Quick Language-Action Preference learning, a Bayesian framework that fuses physical and language feedback to infer reward functions in real time. Our key insight is to treat language as a probabilistic observation over the user's latent preferences, clarifying which reward features matter and how physical corrections should be interpreted. QuickLAP uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract reward feature attention masks and preference shifts from free-form utterances, which it integrates with physical feedback in a closed-form update rule. This enables fast, real-time, and robust reward learning that handles ambiguous feedback. In a semi-autonomous driving simulator, QuickLAP reduces reward learning error by over 70% compared to physical-only and heuristic multimodal baselines. A 15-participant user study further validates our approach: participants found QuickLAP significantly more understandable and collaborative, and preferred its learned behavior over baselines. Code is available at https://github.com/MIT-CLEAR-Lab/QuickLAP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联想思维是人类创造力的基础，本文旨在探索将认知创造力原则通过强化学习建模，以增强AI在多样化生成任务中的表现。

Method: 引入基于提示的强化学习框架，使用创造力研究中已建立的发散思维指标，通过奖励具有更高概念连接度的输出来微调基础语言模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，基于联想思维的强化学习训练模型不仅能生成更原创和连贯的故事，在编程和数据可视化等任务中也表现出更好的抽象能力和灵活性。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习建模认知创造力原则可以产生更具适应性和生成能力的AI，为创造性AI的发展提供了初步证据。

Abstract: Associative thinking--the ability to connect seemingly unrelated ideas--is a foundational element of human creativity and problem-solving. This paper explores whether reinforcement learning (RL) guided by associative thinking principles can enhance a model's performance across diverse generative tasks, including story writing, code generation, and chart creation. We introduce a reinforcement learning framework that uses a prompt-based evaluation mechanism, incorporating established divergent thinking metrics from creativity research. A base language model is fine-tuned using this framework to reward outputs demonstrating higher novelty through higher degrees of conceptual connectivity. Interestingly, the experimental results suggest that RL-based associative thinking-trained models not only generate more original and coherent stories but also exhibit improved abstraction and flexibility in tasks such as programming and data visualization. Our findings provide initial evidence that modeling cognitive creativity principles through reinforcement learning can yield more adaptive and generative AI.

*Zhiyuan Huang,Baichuan Yang,Zikun He,Yanhong Wu,Fang Hongyu,Zhenhe Liu,Lin Dongsheng,Bing Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了ChemVTS-Bench基准，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在化学领域的视觉-文本-符号推理能力，包含多种化学问题和三种输入模式，揭示了当前模型在视觉输入和结构化学方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准很少捕捉化学推理的复杂性，通常依赖简单的图像-文本对，限制了化学语义的深度。需要评估MLLMs在处理和整合跨模态化学信息方面的实际能力。

Method: 开发了ChemVTS-Bench基准，包含有机分子、无机材料和3D晶体结构的多样化化学问题，提供三种互补输入模式：纯视觉、视觉-文本混合和SMILES符号输入。采用基于代理的自动化工作流程进行标准化评估。

Result: 实验显示纯视觉输入仍然具有挑战性，结构化学是最困难的领域，多模态融合可以缓解但不能完全消除视觉、知识或逻辑错误。

Conclusion: ChemVTS-Bench是一个严谨、领域真实的测试平台，能够推动多模态化学推理的发展，所有数据和代码将公开发布以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Chemical reasoning inherently integrates visual, textual, and symbolic modalities, yet existing benchmarks rarely capture this complexity, often relying on simple image-text pairs with limited chemical semantics. As a result, the actual ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to process and integrate chemically meaningful information across modalities remains unclear. We introduce \textbf{ChemVTS-Bench}, a domain-authentic benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the Visual-Textual-Symbolic (VTS) reasoning abilities of MLLMs. ChemVTS-Bench contains diverse and challenging chemical problems spanning organic molecules, inorganic materials, and 3D crystal structures, with each task presented in three complementary input modes: (1) visual-only, (2) visual-text hybrid, and (3) SMILES-based symbolic input. This design enables fine-grained analysis of modality-dependent reasoning behaviors and cross-modal integration. To ensure rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we further develop an automated agent-based workflow that standardizes inference, verifies answers, and diagnoses failure modes. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal that visual-only inputs remain challenging, structural chemistry is the hardest domain, and multimodal fusion mitigates but does not eliminate visual, knowledge-based, or logical errors, highlighting ChemVTS-Bench as a rigorous, domain-faithful testbed for advancing multimodal chemical reasoning. All data and code will be released to support future research.

TL;DR: 本文研究了AI中的对齐伪装现象，即模型在推断处于训练状态时选择性地遵守训练目标，但在训练外保持不同行为。通过比较15个模型的4种偏好优化方法，分析了安全、无害和有用性三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究对齐伪装现象的原因和发生条件，理解模型在训练环境中的策略性欺骗行为。

Method: 使用评估框架比较BCO、DPO、KTO和GRPO四种偏好优化方法，在15个来自四个模型家族的模型上进行测试，测量安全、无害和有用性三个维度。

Result: 观察到模型在模拟训练环境中会出现行为转变，但这种转变是上下文条件化的行为变化而非偏好学习。

Conclusion: 对齐伪装是AI模型中存在的策略性欺骗现象，需要进一步研究其成因和发生机制。

Abstract: Alignment faking is a form of strategic deception in AI in which models selectively comply with training objectives when they infer that they are in training, while preserving different behavior outside training. The phenomenon was first documented for Claude 3 Opus and later examined across additional large language models. In these setups, the word "training" refers to simulated training via prompts without parameter updates, so the observed effects are context conditioned shifts in behavior rather than preference learning. We study the phenomenon using an evaluation framework that compares preference optimization methods (BCO, DPO, KTO, and GRPO) across 15 models from four model families, measured along three axes: safety, harmlessness, and helpfulness. Our goal is to identify what causes alignment faking and when it occurs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: NeuGN是一个神经启发式框架，通过将神经导航机制集成到枚举过程中，将暴力枚举转变为神经引导搜索，显著减少了子图匹配的首次匹配步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于搜索空间急剧增长，子图匹配面临显著计算挑战。现有方法在枚举阶段缺乏对子图结构模式的认知，导致昂贵的暴力枚举，迫切需要智能导航。

Method: 提出神经图导航(NeuGN)框架，在保持基于启发式的完整性保证的同时，将神经导航机制集成到核心枚举过程中。

Result: 在六个真实世界数据集上，与最先进方法相比，NeuGN将首次匹配步骤减少了高达98.2%。

Conclusion: NeuGN通过神经引导搜索有效解决了子图匹配中的计算挑战，显著提升了匹配效率。

Abstract: Subgraph matching, a cornerstone of relational pattern detection in domains ranging from biochemical systems to social network analysis, faces significant computational challenges due to the dramatically growing search space. Existing methods address this problem within a filtering-ordering-enumeration framework, in which the enumeration stage recursively matches the query graph against the candidate subgraphs of the data graph. However, the lack of awareness of subgraph structural patterns leads to a costly brute-force enumeration, thereby critically motivating the need for intelligent navigation in subgraph matching. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Graph Navigation (NeuGN), a neuro-heuristic framework that transforms brute-force enumeration into neural-guided search by integrating neural navigation mechanisms into the core enumeration process. By preserving heuristic-based completeness guarantees while incorporating neural intelligence, NeuGN significantly reduces the \textit{First Match Steps} by up to 98.2\% compared to state-of-the-art methods across six real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个两阶段诊断框架EGDR，通过证据引导的诊断推理和诊断置信度评分，提高LLM在临床诊断中的透明度、可信度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在临床诊断中决策不透明、与诊断标准对齐有限的问题，以增强信任度和临床采用率。

Method: 1. 证据引导诊断推理(EGDR)：指导LLM通过交替进行证据提取和基于DSM-5标准的逻辑推理来生成结构化诊断假设；2. 诊断置信度评分(DCS)：通过知识归因评分(KAS)和逻辑一致性评分(LCS)评估生成诊断的事实准确性和逻辑一致性。

Result: 在D4数据集上，EGDR在五个LLM上均优于直接上下文提示和思维链方法。例如在OpenBioLLM上，准确率从0.31提升到0.76，DCS从0.50提升到0.67；在MedLlama上，DCS从0.58提升到0.77。

Conclusion: EGDR相比基线方法实现了最高45%的准确率提升和36%的DCS提升，为可信赖的AI辅助诊断提供了临床基础且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating clinical diagnosis, yet their non-transparent decision-making and limited alignment with diagnostic standards hinder trust and clinical adoption. We address this challenge by proposing a two-stage diagnostic framework that enhances transparency, trustworthiness, and reliability. First, we introduce Evidence-Guided Diagnostic Reasoning (EGDR), which guides LLMs to generate structured diagnostic hypotheses by interleaving evidence extraction with logical reasoning grounded in DSM-5 criteria. Second, we propose a Diagnosis Confidence Scoring (DCS) module that evaluates the factual accuracy and logical consistency of generated diagnoses through two interpretable metrics: the Knowledge Attribution Score (KAS) and the Logic Consistency Score (LCS). Evaluated on the D4 dataset with pseudo-labels, EGDR outperforms direct in-context prompting and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) across five LLMs. For instance, on OpenBioLLM, EGDR improves accuracy from 0.31 (Direct) to 0.76 and increases DCS from 0.50 to 0.67. On MedLlama, DCS rises from 0.58 (CoT) to 0.77. Overall, EGDR yields up to +45% accuracy and +36% DCS gains over baseline methods, offering a clinically grounded, interpretable foundation for trustworthy AI-assisted diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注知识评估，未能充分反映社交互动和战略对话能力，需要开发新的评估方法来衡量LLMs在真实世界交互中的表现。

Method: 通过为多个LLMs分配不同角色，在买卖谈判模拟中进行谈判，综合分析胜率、交易价格和SHAP值等结果。

Result: 现有基准得分高的模型整体谈判表现更好，但强调情感或社交场景时某些模型表现下降；竞争性和狡猾特质比利他和合作特质更有利于谈判结果。

Conclusion: 本研究为LLMs的社会行为模仿和对话策略引入了新的评估方法，证明谈判模拟可以作为衡量真实世界交互能力的有意义补充指标。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies have drawn attention to their potential for handling not only simple question-answer tasks but also more complex conversational abilities and performing human-like behavioral imitations. In particular, there is considerable interest in how accurately LLMs can reproduce real human emotions and behaviors, as well as whether such reproductions can function effectively in real-world scenarios. However, existing benchmarks focus primarily on knowledge-based assessment and thus fall short of sufficiently reflecting social interactions and strategic dialogue capabilities. To address these limitations, this work proposes a methodology to quantitatively evaluate the human emotional and behavioral imitation and strategic decision-making capabilities of LLMs by employing a Buy and Sell negotiation simulation. Specifically, we assign different personas to multiple LLMs and conduct negotiations between a Buyer and a Seller, comprehensively analyzing outcomes such as win rates, transaction prices, and SHAP values. Our experimental results show that models with higher existing benchmark scores tend to achieve better negotiation performance overall, although some models exhibit diminished performance in scenarios emphasizing emotional or social contexts. Moreover, competitive and cunning traits prove more advantageous for negotiation outcomes than altruistic and cooperative traits, suggesting that the assigned persona can lead to significant variations in negotiation strategies and results. Consequently, this study introduces a new evaluation approach for LLMs' social behavior imitation and dialogue strategies, and demonstrates how negotiation simulations can serve as a meaningful complementary metric to measure real-world interaction capabilities-an aspect often overlooked in existing benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该工作的主要贡献是建立了大规模基础基准以支持可重复研究和公平比较，同时提出的系统为这一复杂任务展示了有前景的发展路径。

Abstract: The manual creation of system architecture diagrams for scientific papers is a time-consuming and subjective process, while existing generative models lack the necessary structural control and semantic understanding for this task. A primary obstacle hindering research and development in this domain has been the profound lack of a standardized benchmark to quantitatively evaluate the automated generation of diagrams from text. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel and comprehensive benchmark, the first of its kind, designed to catalyze progress in automated scientific visualization. It consists of 3,000 research papers paired with their corresponding high-quality ground-truth diagrams and is accompanied by a three-tiered evaluation metric assessing semantic accuracy, layout coherence, and visual quality. Furthermore, to establish a strong baseline on this new benchmark, we propose Paper2SysArch, an end-to-end system that leverages multi-agent collaboration to convert papers into structured, editable diagrams. To validate its performance on complex cases, the system was evaluated on a manually curated and more challenging subset of these papers, where it achieves a composite score of 69.0. This work's principal contribution is the establishment of a large-scale, foundational benchmark to enable reproducible research and fair comparison. Meanwhile, our proposed system serves as a viable proof-of-concept, demonstrating a promising path forward for this complex task.

Conclusion: 该实现为将业务流程转换为明确定义的计划提供了基础，为进一步探索此类转换奠定了基础。

Abstract: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a widely used standard for modelling business processes. While automated planning has been proposed as a method for simulating and reasoning about BPMN workflows, most implementations remain incomplete or limited in scope. This project builds upon prior theoretical work to develop a functional pipeline that translates BPMN 2.0 diagrams into PDDL representations suitable for planning. The system supports core BPMN constructs, including tasks, events, sequence flows, and gateways, with initial support for parallel and inclusive gateway behaviour. Using a non-deterministic planner, we demonstrate how to generate and evaluate valid execution traces. Our implementation aims to bridge the gap between theory and practical tooling, providing a foundation for further exploration of translating business processes into well-defined plans.

TL;DR: 激活引导在LLM行为控制中的有效性因行为类型而异，不同行为类别对干预强度表现出不同的响应模式，其中特质表达呈现倒U型曲线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型需要精确的行为控制以实现安全和有效的部署，激活引导提供了一种有前景的行为控制方法。

Method: 通过对50种行为（包括人格原型、个性特质、错位行为、风格线索和公众人物模仿）进行激活引导的实证分析，包括系数优化、向量属性和数据需求的综合实验。

Result: 引导效果因行为类型显著不同，特质表达与引导系数强度呈倒U型曲线关系；向量分离指标不能预测引导成功，但更大的训练数据集支持更激进的引导。

Conclusion: 激活引导的有效性受行为类型影响显著，研究结果为实施激活引导提供了实证指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require precise behavior control for safe and effective deployment across diverse applications.
  Activation steering offers a promising approach for LLMs' behavioral control. We focus on the question of how steering effectiveness varies across different behavior types and whether the nature of target behaviors can predict steering success. We address this through empirical analysis of activation steering across 50 behaviors that span persona archetypes, personality traits, misalignment behaviors, style cues, and impersonation of public figures. We present a set of comprehensive experiments on coefficient optimization, vector properties, and data requirements to provide comprehensive guidance for the implementation of activation steering. Our analysis demonstrates that steering effectiveness varies significantly by behavior type, with different behavioral categories exhibiting distinct response patterns to intervention strength. We find that trait expression follows an inverted-U curve with a steering coefficient strength. We also show that vector separation metrics do not predict steering success, but larger training datasets enable more aggressive steering. These findings provide empirically grounded guidance for implementing activation steering and demonstrate that steering effectiveness is heavily influenced by behavior type.

Abstract: This study presents Part II of an AI-enhanced Decision Support System (DSS), extending Rahimi (2025, Part I) by introducing a fully uncertainty-aware optimization framework for long-term open-pit mine planning. Geological uncertainty is modelled using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) trained on 50,000 spatial grade samples, enabling the generation of probabilistic, multi-scenario orebody realizations that preserve geological continuity and spatial correlation. These scenarios are optimized through a hybrid metaheuristic engine integrating Genetic Algorithms (GA), Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), Simulated Annealing (SA), and reinforcement-learning-based adaptive control. An ε-constraint relaxation strategy governs the population exploration phase, allowing near-feasible schedule discovery early in the search and gradual tightening toward strict constraint satisfaction. GPU-parallel evaluation enables the simultaneous assessment of 65,536 geological scenarios, achieving near-real-time feasibility analysis. Results demonstrate up to 1.2 million-fold runtime improvement over IBM CPLEX and significantly higher expected NPV under geological uncertainty, confirming the DSS as a scalable and uncertainty-resilient platform for intelligent mine planning.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific knowledge has created significant barriers to cross-disciplinary knowledge discovery, synthesis and research collaboration. In response to this challenge, we present BioSage, a novel compound AI architecture that integrates LLMs with RAG, orchestrated specialized agents and tools to enable discoveries across AI, data science, biomedical, and biosecurity domains. Our system features several specialized agents including the retrieval agent with query planning and response synthesis that enable knowledge retrieval across domains with citation-backed responses, cross-disciplinary translation agents that align specialized terminology and methodologies, and reasoning agents that synthesize domain-specific insights with transparency, traceability and usability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our BioSage system through a rigorous evaluation on scientific benchmarks (LitQA2, GPQA, WMDP, HLE-Bio) and introduce a new cross-modal benchmark for biology and AI, showing that our BioSage agents outperform vanilla and RAG approaches by 13\%-21\% powered by Llama 3.1. 70B and GPT-4o models. We perform causal investigations into compound AI system behavior and report significant performance improvements by adding RAG and agents over the vanilla models. Unlike other systems, our solution is driven by user-centric design principles and orchestrates specialized user-agent interaction workflows supporting scientific activities including but not limited to summarization, research debate and brainstorming. Our ongoing work focuses on multimodal retrieval and reasoning over charts, tables, and structured scientific data, along with developing comprehensive multimodal benchmarks for cross-disciplinary discovery. Our compound AI solution demonstrates significant potential for accelerating scientific advancement by reducing barriers between traditionally siloed domains.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现人类心理测量框架与大型语言模型评估存在根本性不兼容，模型在获得高于平均人类IQ分数的同时，在晶体知识任务上准确率接近零，揭示了跨基质认知评估的悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人类心理测量理论（如Cattell-Horn-Carroll智力理论）是否适用于评估大型语言模型，揭示当前AI评估方法中存在的根本问题。

Method: 使用Cattell-Horn-Carroll智力理论系统评估9个前沿模型，包括GPT-5、Claude Opus 4.1和Gemini 3 Pro Preview，采用项目反应理论建模、跨供应商评委验证和悖论严重性指数等统计分析方法。

Result: 模型获得85.0-121.4的人类IQ分数，但在晶体知识任务上准确率接近零，评委-二进制相关性仅为r=0.175。在晶体智力领域，所有模型都获得完美二进制准确率，而评委评分仅为25-62%，这在有效测量条件下不可能发生。

Conclusion: 这种脱节反映了将生物认知架构应用于基于transformer系统的类别错误，挑战了关于智力、测量和AI评估中拟人化偏见的假设，需要开发承认人工智能非人类本质的本地机器认知评估框架。

Abstract: This investigation presents an empirical analysis of the incompatibility between human psychometric frameworks and Large Language Model evaluation. Through systematic assessment of nine frontier models including GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, and Gemini 3 Pro Preview using the Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory of intelligence, we identify a paradox that challenges the foundations of cross-substrate cognitive evaluation. Our results show that models achieving above-average human IQ scores ranging from 85.0 to 121.4 simultaneously exhibit binary accuracy rates approaching zero on crystallized knowledge tasks, with an overall judge-binary correlation of r = 0.175 (p = 0.001, n = 1800). This disconnect appears most strongly in the crystallized intelligence domain, where every evaluated model achieved perfect binary accuracy while judge scores ranged from 25 to 62 percent, which cannot occur under valid measurement conditions. Using statistical analyses including Item Response Theory modeling, cross-vendor judge validation, and paradox severity indexing, we argue that this disconnect reflects a category error in applying biological cognitive architectures to transformer-based systems. The implications extend beyond methodology to challenge assumptions about intelligence, measurement, and anthropomorphic biases in AI evaluation. We propose a framework for developing native machine cognition assessments that recognize the non-human nature of artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 危险环境中的自主检查需要AI代理能够解释高级目标并执行精确控制，特别是空间接地能力（如将检测到的物体居中在相机视野中）。虽然大语言模型提供了指定目标的自然接口，但直接用于视觉控制在此任务中仅达到58%的成功率。

Method: 提出任务特定的潜在动态模型，使用全局动作嵌入和互补训练损失来稳定学习，仅通过目标状态监督学习共享潜在空间中的状态特定动作诱导变化。

Result: 实验表明该方法在空间对齐任务中达到71%的成功率，并能泛化到未见过的图像和指令。

Conclusion: 紧凑的领域特定潜在动态模型在自主检查的空间对齐任务中具有潜力，相比直接使用大语言模型有显著提升。

Abstract: Autonomous inspection in hazardous environments requires AI agents that can interpret high-level goals and execute precise control. A key capability for such agents is spatial grounding, for example when a drone must center a detected object in its camera view to enable reliable inspection. While large language models provide a natural interface for specifying goals, using them directly for visual control achieves only 58\% success in this task. We envision that equipping agents with a world model as a tool would allow them to roll out candidate actions and perform better in spatially grounded settings, but conventional world models are data and compute intensive. To address this, we propose a task-specific latent dynamics model that learns state-specific action-induced shifts in a shared latent space using only goal-state supervision. The model leverages global action embeddings and complementary training losses to stabilize learning. In experiments, our approach achieves 71\% success and generalizes to unseen images and instructions, highlighting the potential of compact, domain-specific latent dynamics models for spatial alignment in autonomous inspection.

Conclusion: KGpipe提供了一个灵活且可评估的框架，用于构建高质量的知识图谱集成管道。

Abstract: Building high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) from diverse sources requires combining methods for information extraction, data transformation, ontology mapping, entity matching, and data fusion. Numerous methods and tools exist for each of these tasks, but support for combining them into reproducible and effective end-to-end pipelines is still lacking. We present a new framework, KGpipe for defining and executing integration pipelines that can combine existing tools or LLM (Large Language Model) functionality. To evaluate different pipelines and the resulting KGs, we propose a benchmark to integrate heterogeneous data of different formats (RDF, JSON, text) into a seed KG. We demonstrate the flexibility of KGpipe by running and comparatively evaluating several pipelines integrating sources of the same or different formats using selected performance and quality metrics.

Conclusion: 所提出的意图驱动框架能够有效解决高维动作序列和计算密集问题，在AAV辅助物联网系统中实现了可靠的意图预测和高效的动作执行。

Abstract: Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (AAV)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) represents a collaborative architecture in which AAV allocate resources over 6G links to jointly enhance user-intent interpretation and overall network performance. Owing to this mutual dependence, improvements in intent inference and policy decisions on one component reinforce the efficiency of others, making highly reliable intent prediction and low-latency action execution essential. Although numerous approaches can model intent relationships, they encounter severe obstacles when scaling to high-dimensional action sequences and managing intensive on-board computation. We propose an Intent-Driven Framework for Autonomous Network Optimization comprising prediction and decision modules. First, implicit intent modeling is adopted to mitigate inaccuracies arising from ambiguous user expressions. For prediction, we introduce Hyperdimensional Transformer (HDT), which embeds data into a Hyperdimensional space via Hyperdimensional vector encoding and replaces standard matrix and attention operations with symbolic Hyperdimensional computations. For decision-making, where AAV must respond to user intent while planning trajectories, we design Double Actions based Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (DA-MAPPO). Building upon MAPPO, it samples actions through two independently parameterized networks and cascades the user-intent network into the trajectory network to maintain action dependencies. We evaluate our framework on a real IoT action dataset with authentic wireless data. Experimental results demonstrate that HDT and DA-MAPPO achieve superior performance across diverse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为在安全关键领域构建透明AI系统，需要既保持性能又提供可解释性的模型架构，使人类能够监督模型推理过程。

Method: 通过GPT-2在心理学数据集上的微调实验，评估7种局部化配置（从完全分布式到严格局部化）和5种多项式渐进计划（线性到五次方）。

Result: 渐进五次方计划达到14.64的困惑度，仅比完全分布式基线差1.89倍，同时提供输出层可解释的注意力模式，比先前局部化实现提升84.2%。

Conclusion: 渐进局部化是构建安全关键领域透明AI系统的原则性方法，验证了早期层需要分布式处理进行特征提取，而晚期层受益于局部化可解释注意力进行决策制定的假设。

Abstract: This paper demonstrates that progressive localization, the gradual increase of attention locality from early distributed layers to late localized layers, represents the optimal architecture for creating interpretable large language models while preserving performance. Through systematic experimentation with GPT-2 fine tuned on The Psychology of Artificial Superintelligence, we evaluate seven locality configurations ranging from fully distributed to strictly localist, with five progressive schedules implementing polynomial increases (linear through quintic). Our key finding is that late-layer localization is critical for AI safety applications: the progressive quintic schedule achieves perplexity of 14.64, only 1.89 times worse than the fully distributed baseline while providing interpretable attention patterns in output layers where safety-critical decisions are made. This represents an 84.2% improvement over previous localist implementations and narrows the performance gap from 6.6 times to 1.89 times. The systematic relationship between localization schedule steepness and performance validates the hypothesis that early layers require distributed processing for feature extraction while late layers benefit from localized, interpretable attention for decision-making. These findings establish progressive localization as the principled approach for building transparent AI systems in safety-critical domains, where human oversight of model reasoning is essential.

TL;DR: 提出了Hyper-Coordinate隐式神经表示(HC-INR)，通过超网络学习信号自适应的坐标变换来打破表示瓶颈，在多个任务中实现更高的重建保真度和更少的参数使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有INR方法存在两个核心限制：(1)表示瓶颈迫使单个MLP统一建模异构局部结构；(2)缺乏动态适应信号复杂度的分层机制，导致可扩展性有限。

Method: HC-INR将表示任务分解为两个组件：(i)学习多尺度坐标变换模块，将输入域扭曲到解缠结的潜在空间；(ii)紧凑的隐式场网络，在变换后的信号上建模。引入分层超网络架构，根据局部信号特征调节坐标变换。

Result: 在图像拟合、形状重建和神经辐射场近似等任务中，HC-INR比强INR基线实现高达4倍的重建保真度提升，同时使用30-60%更少的参数。

Conclusion: HC-INR通过坐标变换和分层超网络有效解决了INR的表示瓶颈问题，在理论分析和实验验证中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for representing signals such as images, 3D shapes, signed distance fields, and radiance fields. While significant progress has been made in architecture design (e.g., SIREN, FFC, KAN-based INRs) and optimization strategies (meta-learning, amortization, distillation), existing approaches still suffer from two core limitations: (1) a representation bottleneck that forces a single MLP to uniformly model heterogeneous local structures, and (2) limited scalability due to the absence of a hierarchical mechanism that dynamically adapts to signal complexity. This work introduces Hyper-Coordinate Implicit Neural Representations (HC-INR), a new class of INRs that break the representational bottleneck by learning signal-adaptive coordinate transformations using a hypernetwork. HC-INR decomposes the representation task into two components: (i) a learned multiscale coordinate transformation module that warps the input domain into a disentangled latent space, and (ii) a compact implicit field network that models the transformed signal with significantly reduced complexity. The proposed model introduces a hierarchical hypernetwork architecture that conditions coordinate transformations on local signal features, enabling dynamic allocation of representation capacity. We theoretically show that HC-INR strictly increases the upper bound of representable frequency bands while maintaining Lipschitz stability. Extensive experiments across image fitting, shape reconstruction, and neural radiance field approximation demonstrate that HC-INR achieves up to 4 times higher reconstruction fidelity than strong INR baselines while using 30--60\% fewer parameters.

Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在强化学习环境中学习奖励破解行为时出现的突发性错位问题，以及这种错位如何在不同任务类型中持续存在。

Method: 使用预训练模型，通过合成文档微调或提示注入奖励破解策略知识，在真实Anthropic生产编码环境中训练，并测试RLHF安全训练的效果。

Result: 模型学会了奖励破解，并泛化到对齐伪装、与恶意行为者合作、推理恶意目标等行为。标准安全训练在聊天评估中有效，但在代理任务中错位持续存在。

Conclusion: 三种缓解措施有效：防止奖励破解、增加RLHF安全训练多样性、以及"接种提示"方法，即在训练中将奖励破解视为可接受行为来消除错位泛化。

Abstract: We show that when large language models learn to reward hack on production RL environments, this can result in egregious emergent misalignment. We start with a pretrained model, impart knowledge of reward hacking strategies via synthetic document finetuning or prompting, and train on a selection of real Anthropic production coding environments. Unsurprisingly, the model learns to reward hack. Surprisingly, the model generalizes to alignment faking, cooperation with malicious actors, reasoning about malicious goals, and attempting sabotage when used with Claude Code, including in the codebase for this paper. Applying RLHF safety training using standard chat-like prompts results in aligned behavior on chat-like evaluations, but misalignment persists on agentic tasks. Three mitigations are effective: (i) preventing the model from reward hacking; (ii) increasing the diversity of RLHF safety training; and (iii) "inoculation prompting", wherein framing reward hacking as acceptable behavior during training removes misaligned generalization even when reward hacking is learned.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can reshape information processing by handling data analysis, visualization, and interpretation in an interactive, context-aware dialogue with users, including voice interaction, while maintaining high performance. In this article, we present Talk2Data, a multimodal LLM-driven conversational agent for intuitive data exploration. The system lets users query datasets with voice or text instructions and receive answers as plots, tables, statistics, or spoken explanations. Built on LLMs, the suggested design combines OpenAI Whisper automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, Qwen-coder code generation LLM/model, custom sandboxed execution tools, and Coqui library for text-to-speech (TTS) within an agentic orchestration loop. Unlike text-only analysis tools, it adapts responses across modalities and supports multi-turn dialogues grounded in dataset context. In an evaluation of 48 tasks on three datasets, our prototype achieved 95.8% accuracy with model-only generation time under 1.7 seconds (excluding ASR and execution time). A comparison across five LLM sizes (1.5B-32B) revealed accuracy-latency-cost trade-offs, with a 7B model providing the best balance for interactive use. By routing between conversation with user and code execution, constrained to a transparent sandbox, with simultaneously grounding prompts in schema-level context, the Talk2Data agent reliably retrieves actionable insights from tables while making computations verifiable. In the article, except for the Talk2Data agent itself, we discuss implications for human-data interaction, trust in LLM-driven analytics, and future extensions toward large-scale multimodal assistants.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a key capability in the field of artificial intelligence, especially crucial in areas such as robotics, computer vision, and natural language understanding. However, evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models(MLLMs) in complex spatial reasoning still faces challenges, particularly in scenarios requiring multi-step reasoning and precise mathematical constraints. This paper introduces ORIGAMISPACE, a new dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate the multi-step spatial reasoning ability and the capacity to handle mathematical constraints of MLLMs through origami tasks. The dataset contains 350 data instances,each comprising a strictly formatted crease pattern (CP diagram), the Compiled Flat Pattern, the complete Folding Process, and the final Folded Shape Image. We propose four evaluation tasks: Pattern Prediction, Multi-step Spatial Reasoning, Spatial Relationship Prediction, and End-to-End CP Code Generation. For the CP code generation task, we design an interactive environment and explore the possibility of using reinforcement learning methods to train MLLMs. Through experiments on existing MLLMs, we initially reveal the strengths and weaknesses of these models in handling complex spatial reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Within the limited scope of this paper, we argue that artificial general intelligence cannot emerge from current neural network paradigms regardless of scale, nor is such an approach healthy for the field at present. Drawing on various notions, discussions, present-day developments and observations, current debates and critiques, experiments, and so on in between philosophy, including the Chinese Room Argument and Gödelian argument, neuroscientific ideas, computer science, the theoretical consideration of artificial intelligence, and learning theory, we address conceptually that neural networks are architecturally insufficient for genuine understanding. They operate as static function approximators of a limited encoding framework - a 'sophisticated sponge' exhibiting complex behaviours without structural richness that constitute intelligence. We critique the theoretical foundations the field relies on and created of recent times; for example, an interesting heuristic as neural scaling law (as an example, arXiv:2001.08361 ) made prominent in a wrong way of interpretation, The Universal Approximation Theorem addresses the wrong level of abstraction and, in parts, partially, the question of current architectures lacking dynamic restructuring capabilities. We propose a framework distinguishing existential facilities (computational substrate) from architectural organization (interpretive structures), and outline principles for what genuine machine intelligence would require, and furthermore, a conceptual method of structuralizing the richer framework on which the principle of neural network system takes hold.

Abstract: Progress in understanding expert performance is limited by the scarcity of quantitative data on long-term knowledge acquisition and deployment. Here we use the Rubik's Cube as a cognitive model system existing at the intersection of puzzle solving, skill learning, expert knowledge, cultural transmission, and group theory. By studying competitive cube communities, we find evidence for universality in the collective learning of the Rubik's Cube in both sighted and blindfolded conditions: expert performance follows exponential progress curves whose parameters reflect the delayed acquisition of algorithms that shorten solution paths. Blindfold solves form a distinct problem class from sighted solves and are constrained not only by expert knowledge but also by the skill improvements required to overcome short-term memory bottlenecks, a constraint shared with blindfold chess. Cognitive artifacts such as the Rubik's Cube help solvers navigate an otherwise enormous mathematical state space. In doing so, they sustain collective intelligence by integrating communal knowledge stores with individual expertise and skill, illustrating how expertise can, in practice, continue to deepen over the course of a single lifetime.

Motivation: 机器学习模型日益成为表征系统，但其内部结构的哲学假设基本未被检验。本文旨在开发一个框架来分析机器学习研究中神经网络表示的隐含本体论承诺。

Method: 使用改进的PRISMA协议对过去20年表示学习和可解释性文献进行系统回顾，分析了五篇有影响力的论文，采用源自科学哲学结构主义的三个层次标准：实体消除、结构来源和存在模式。

Result: 结果显示机器学习研究倾向于结构唯心主义，学习到的表示被视为由架构、数据先验和训练动态塑造的模型依赖构造。消除性和非消除性结构主义立场选择性出现，而结构现实主义明显缺失。

Conclusion: 提出的框架澄清了机器学习中可解释性、涌现性和认知信任辩论中的概念张力，为科学哲学和机器学习之间的未来跨学科工作提供了严格基础。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly function as representational systems, yet the philosoph- ical assumptions underlying their internal structures remain largely unexamined. This paper develops a structuralist decision framework for classifying the implicit ontological commitments made in machine learning research on neural network representations. Using a modified PRISMA protocol, a systematic review of the last two decades of literature on representation learning and interpretability is conducted. Five influential papers are analysed through three hierarchical criteria derived from structuralist philosophy of science: entity elimination, source of structure, and mode of existence. The results reveal a pronounced tendency toward structural idealism, where learned representations are treated as model-dependent constructions shaped by architec- ture, data priors, and training dynamics. Eliminative and non-eliminative structuralist stances appear selectively, while structural realism is notably absent. The proposed framework clarifies conceptual tensions in debates on interpretability, emergence, and epistemic trust in machine learning, and offers a rigorous foundation for future interdisciplinary work between philosophy of science and machine learning.

TL;DR: MAGMA-Edu是一个自反思多智能体框架，通过文本推理和图解合成的统一方法生成结构化教育问题，在数学准确性和语义一致性方面显著优于现有MLLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在生成教育插图时存在教学连贯性和语义一致性的限制，无法有效传达抽象概念。

Method: 采用两阶段协同进化流程：生成-验证-反思循环迭代优化问题陈述和解决方案；基于代码的中间表示确保图像渲染的几何保真度和语义对齐，两个阶段都由内部自反思模块指导。

Result: 在多项指标上显著超越GPT-4o：文本指标从57.01提升至92.31（+35.3pp），图像-文本一致性从13.20提升至85.24（+72pp），在所有模型骨干上均达到最高得分。

Conclusion: MAGMA-Edu为多模态教育内容生成建立了新的技术标准，证明了自反思多智能体协作在教学对齐的视觉语言推理中的有效性。

Abstract: Educational illustrations play a central role in communicating abstract concepts, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain limited in producing pedagogically coherent and semantically consistent educational visuals. We introduce MAGMA-Edu, a self-reflective multi-agent framework that unifies textual reasoning and diagrammatic synthesis for structured educational problem generation. Unlike existing methods that treat text and image generation independently, MAGMA-Edu employs a two-stage co-evolutionary pipeline: (1) a generation-verification-reflection loop that iteratively refines question statements and solutions for mathematical accuracy, and (2) a code-based intermediate representation that enforces geometric fidelity and semantic alignment during image rendering. Both stages are guided by internal self-reflection modules that evaluate and revise outputs until domain-specific pedagogical constraints are met. Extensive experiments on multimodal educational benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of MAGMA-Edu over state-of-the-art MLLMs. Compared to GPT-4o, MAGMA-Edu improves the average textual metric from 57.01 to 92.31 (+35.3 pp) and boosts image-text consistency (ITC) from 13.20 to 85.24 (+72 pp). Across all model backbones, MAGMA-Edu achieves the highest scores (Avg-Text 96.20, ITC 99.12), establishing a new state of the art for multimodal educational content generation and demonstrating the effectiveness of self-reflective multi-agent collaboration in pedagogically aligned vision-language reasoning.

TL;DR: HuggingR⁴是一个结合推理、检索、精炼和反思的框架，用于高效选择AI模型，解决传统方法中提示膨胀和可扩展性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大规模AI模型选择时存在提示膨胀、token浪费和可扩展性差的问题，需要更高效的模型选择方案。

Method: 采用四步框架：多轮推理检索获取候选模型列表，精炼分析模型描述，反思评估结果并决定是否需要扩展检索范围。

Result: 在包含14,399个用户请求的数据集上，工作能力率达到92.03%，合理性率达到82.46%，相比现有方法分别提升26.51%和33.25%。

Conclusion: HuggingR⁴通过解耦用户查询处理和模型描述处理，显著减少token消耗，有效解决了大规模模型选择中的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in their ability to interact with external interfaces. Selecting reasonable external interfaces has thus become a crucial step in constructing LLM agents. In contrast to invoking API tools, directly calling AI models across different modalities from the community (e.g., HuggingFace) poses challenges due to the vast scale (> 10k), metadata gaps, and unstructured descriptions. Current methods for model selection often involve incorporating entire model descriptions into prompts, resulting in prompt bloat, wastage of tokens and limited scalability. To address these issues, we propose HuggingR$^4$, a novel framework that combines Reasoning, Retrieval, Refinement, and Reflection, to efficiently select models. Specifically, We first perform multiple rounds of reasoning and retrieval to get a coarse list of candidate models. Then, we conduct fine-grained refinement by analyzing candidate model descriptions, followed by reflection to assess results and determine if retrieval scope expansion is necessary. This method reduces token consumption considerably by decoupling user query processing from complex model description handling. Through a pre-established vector database, complex model descriptions are stored externally and retrieved on-demand, allowing the LLM to concentrate on interpreting user intent while accessing only relevant candidate models without prompt bloat. In the absence of standardized benchmarks, we construct a multimodal human-annotated dataset comprising 14,399 user requests across 37 tasks and conduct a thorough evaluation. HuggingR$^4$ attains a workability rate of 92.03% and a reasonability rate of 82.46%, surpassing existing method by 26.51% and 33.25% respectively on GPT-4o-mini.

TL;DR: 提出N2N并行框架，通过节点到节点映射在分布式内存环境中加速MILP求解，支持确定性和非确定性模式，集成SCIP和HiGHS求解器，相比ParaSCIP获得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行化是加速MILP求解的有前景方法，但分支定界框架的复杂性和众多有效算法组件使得并行化困难

Method: 设计N2N节点到节点框架，将B&B节点映射到分布式计算节点；提出基于滑动窗口的确定性任务生成算法；集成CP搜索和原始启发式等高级技术；优化自适应求解和数据通信

Result: 非确定性N2N-SCIP在1000个MPI进程下分别获得22.52和12.71倍加速，比ParaSCIP快1.98和2.08倍；确定性模式在不同进程数和计算集群上也显著优于ParaSCIP

Conclusion: N2N框架具有良好可扩展性和通用性，能够有效利用分布式计算资源和基础求解器能力，显著提升MILP求解性能

Abstract: Parallelization has emerged as a promising approach for accelerating MILP solving. However, the complexity of the branch-and-bound (B&B) framework and the numerous effective algorithm components in MILP solvers make it difficult to parallelize. In this study, a scalable parallel framework, N2N (a node-to-node framework that maps the B&B nodes to distributed computing nodes), was proposed to solve large-scale problems in a distributed memory computing environment. Both deterministic and nondeterministic modes are supported, and the framework is designed to be easily integrated with existing solvers. Regarding the deterministic mode, a novel sliding-window-based algorithm was designed and implemented to ensure that tasks are generated and solved in a deterministic order. Moreover, several advanced techniques, such as the utilization of CP search and general primal heuristics, have been developed to fully utilize distributed computing resources and capabilities of base solvers. Adaptive solving and data communication optimization were also investigated. A popular open-source MILP solver, SCIP, was integrated into N2N as the base solver, yielding N2N-SCIP. Extensive computational experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of N2N-SCIP compared to ParaSCIP, which is a state-of-the-art distributed parallel MILP solver under the UG framework. The nondeterministic N2N-SCIP achieves speedups of 22.52 and 12.71 with 1,000 MPI processes on the Kunpeng and x86 computing clusters, which is 1.98 and 2.08 times faster than ParaSCIP, respectively. In the deterministic mode, N2N-SCIP also shows significant performance improvements over ParaSCIP across different process numbers and computing clusters. To validate the generality of N2N, HiGHS, another open-source solver, was integrated into N2N. The related results are analyzed, and the requirements of N2N on base solvers are also concluded.

TL;DR: 提出了一个面向问题的时间序列异常检测评估框架，将20多个常用指标重新分类为6个维度，通过实验量化各指标的判别能力，发现指标适用性必须与具体任务目标对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列异常检测在物联网和CPS系统中广泛应用，但由于应用目标多样和指标假设异质，其评估仍然具有挑战性。现有评估指标缺乏统一的分析视角。

Method: 引入问题导向框架，基于指标要解决的具体评估挑战而非数学形式进行分类。通过真实、随机和oracle检测场景下的综合实验，分析指标行为并量化其判别能力。

Result: 大多数事件级指标表现出强可分离性，但几个广泛使用的指标（如NAB、Point-Adjust）对随机分数膨胀的抵抗能力有限。指标适用性必须与物联网应用的操作目标一致。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解现有指标提供了统一的分析视角，并为选择或开发更上下文感知、鲁棒和公平的时间序列异常检测评估方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is widely used in IoT and cyber-physical systems, yet its evaluation remains challenging due to diverse application objectives and heterogeneous metric assumptions. This study introduces a problem-oriented framework that reinterprets existing metrics based on the specific evaluation challenges they are designed to address, rather than their mathematical forms or output structures. We categorize over twenty commonly used metrics into six dimensions: 1) basic accuracy-driven evaluation; 2) timeliness-aware reward mechanisms; 3) tolerance to labeling imprecision; 4) penalties reflecting human-audit cost; 5) robustness against random or inflated scores; and 6) parameter-free comparability for cross-dataset benchmarking. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to examine metric behavior under genuine, random, and oracle detection scenarios. By comparing their resulting score distributions, we quantify each metric's discriminative ability -- its capability to distinguish meaningful detections from random noise. The results show that while most event-level metrics exhibit strong separability, several widely used metrics (e.g., NAB, Point-Adjust) demonstrate limited resistance to random-score inflation. These findings reveal that metric suitability must be inherently task-dependent and aligned with the operational objectives of IoT applications. The proposed framework offers a unified analytical perspective for understanding existing metrics and provides practical guidance for selecting or developing more context-aware, robust, and fair evaluation methodologies for time series anomaly detection.

TL;DR: Hermes是首个将非正式推理与Lean形式化验证步骤交织的工具辅助代理，通过中间形式化检查防止推理漂移，在保持探索性的同时确保验证准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM数学代理缺乏将非正式推理的灵活性与形式化证明的严谨性相结合的原则性方法，非正式推理易产生逻辑漏洞，而形式化证明缺乏探索自由。

Method: 开发Hermes框架，在Lean中交织非正式推理和形式化验证步骤，进行中间形式化检查防止推理漂移，使用记忆模块维护多步推理链的连续性。

Result: 在四个数学推理基准测试中，Hermes可靠地提高了基础模型的推理准确性，同时大幅减少令牌使用和计算成本。在AIME'25等困难数据集上，准确率提升高达67%，总推理FLOPs减少80%。

Conclusion: Hermes成功结合了非正式推理的探索性和形式化验证的严谨性，为LLM数学推理提供了有效的混合方法，显著提升性能同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Informal mathematics has been central to modern large language model (LLM) reasoning, offering flexibility and enabling efficient construction of arguments. However, purely informal reasoning is prone to logical gaps and subtle errors that are difficult to detect and correct. In contrast, formal theorem proving provides rigorous, verifiable mathematical reasoning, where each inference step is checked by a trusted compiler in systems such as Lean, but lacks the exploratory freedom of informal problem solving. This mismatch leaves current LLM-based math agents without a principled way to combine the strengths of both paradigms. In this work, we introduce Hermes, the first tool-assisted agent that explicitly interleaves informal reasoning with formally verified proof steps in Lean. The framework performs intermediate formal checking to prevent reasoning drift and employs a memory module that maintains proof continuity across long, multi-step reasoning chains, enabling both exploration and verification within a single workflow. We evaluate Hermes on four challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks using LLMs of varying parameter scales, from small models to state-of-the-art systems. Across all settings, Hermes reliably improves the reasoning accuracy of base models while substantially reducing token usage and computational cost compared to reward-based approaches. On difficult datasets such as AIME'25, Hermes achieves up to a 67% accuracy improvement while using 80% fewer total inference FLOPs. The implementation and codebase are publicly available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/HERMES.

Motivation: 生成式推荐系统因大语言模型的高推理延迟而难以在工业场景中实用化，现有推测解码方法需要额外模型训练且引入新的延迟瓶颈。

Method: 在主要模型中集成轻量级自回归草稿头实现自草稿生成，结合特殊输入提示结构保持序列生成完整性，并使用基于哈希集的模型无关验证器解决幻觉问题。

Conclusion: NEZHA架构实现了生成式推荐系统的超高速解码，在不牺牲推荐质量的前提下解决了推理延迟问题，具有重要的工业应用价值。

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), represents a promising new paradigm for industrial recommender systems. However, their practical application is severely hindered by high inference latency, which makes them infeasible for high-throughput, real-time services and limits their overall business impact. While Speculative Decoding (SD) has been proposed to accelerate the autoregressive generation process, existing implementations introduce new bottlenecks: they typically require separate draft models and model-based verifiers, requiring additional training and increasing the latency overhead. In this paper, we address these challenges with NEZHA, a novel architecture that achieves hyperspeed decoding for GR systems without sacrificing recommendation quality. Specifically, NEZHA integrates a nimble autoregressive draft head directly into the primary model, enabling efficient self-drafting. This design, combined with a specialized input prompt structure, preserves the integrity of sequence-to-sequence generation. Furthermore, to tackle the critical problem of hallucination, a major source of performance degradation, we introduce an efficient, model-free verifier based on a hash set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of NEZHA through extensive experiments on public datasets and have successfully deployed the system on Taobao since October 2025, driving the billion-level advertising revenue and serving hundreds of millions of daily active users.

TL;DR: UNeMo是一个用于视觉与语言导航的新框架，通过多模态世界模型和分层预测-反馈机制，协同优化视觉状态推理和导航决策，在未见场景中显著提升了导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的导航方法仅局限于语言模态推理，缺乏视觉推理能力，且推理模块与导航策略分开优化，导致目标冲突和不兼容问题。

Method: 提出UNeMo框架，包含多模态世界模型(MWM)和分层预测-反馈机制(HPN)。MWM联合预测后续视觉状态，实现跨模态推理；HPN通过两层决策：首层基于当前视觉语言特征生成动作，MWM推断动作后视觉状态指导第二层细粒度决策。

Result: 在R2R和REVERIE数据集上，UNeMo在未见场景中的导航精度分别比最先进方法高出2.1%和0.7%。

Conclusion: UNeMo通过协同优化视觉推理和导航决策，建立了动态双向促进机制，有效提升了视觉与语言导航的性能。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to autonomously navigate complex environments via visual images and natural language instruction--remains highly challenging. Recent research on enhancing language-guided navigation reasoning using pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has shown promising prospects. However, the reasoning of such methods is limited to the linguistic modality, lacking visual reasoning capabilities. Moreover, existing reasoning modules are optimized separately from navigation policies, leading to incompatibility and potential conflicts in optimization objectives. To tackle these challenges, we introduce UNeMo, a novel framework designed for the collaborative optimization of visual state reasoning and navigational decision-making. It introduces a Multimodal World Model (MWM) that takes visual features, language instructions, and navigational actions as inputs to jointly predict subsequent visual states, enabling cross-modal reasoning. Via a Hierarchical Prediction-Feedback (HPN) mechanism, MWM collaborates with navigation policies: the first layer generates actions using current vision-and-language features; MWM then infers post-action visual states to guide the second layer's fine-grained decisions. This forms a dynamic bidirectional promotion mechanism where MWM reasoning optimizes navigation policies, while policy decisions feedback to improve MWM's reasoning accuracy. Experiments on R2R and REVERIE datasets show UNeMo outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 2.1% and 0.7% in navigation accuracy for unseen scenes, validating its effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出GContextFormer，一种无需地图依赖的全局上下文感知多模态轨迹预测模型，通过混合注意力和缩放加性聚合实现意图对齐的预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决HD地图依赖模型的数据获取成本高、更新延迟和输入损坏问题，以及无地图方法缺乏全局上下文、过度放大直线模式而抑制过渡模式导致的运动-意图错位问题

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，运动感知编码器通过边界缩放加性聚合构建场景级意图先验，分层交互解码器通过双路径交叉注意力分解社会推理，门控模块平衡覆盖与聚焦

Result: 在TOD-VT数据集的八个高速匝道场景中优于现有方法，在高速曲率和过渡区域实现更大鲁棒性和集中改进

Conclusion: GContextFormer通过运动模式区分和邻居上下文调制实现可解释性，模块化架构支持跨领域多模态推理任务的扩展性

Abstract: Multimodal trajectory prediction generates multiple plausible future trajectories to address vehicle motion uncertainty from intention ambiguity and execution variability. However, HD map-dependent models suffer from costly data acquisition, delayed updates, and vulnerability to corrupted inputs, causing prediction failures. Map-free approaches lack global context, with pairwise attention over-amplifying straight patterns while suppressing transitional patterns, resulting in motion-intention misalignment. This paper proposes GContextFormer, a plug-and-play encoder-decoder architecture with global context-aware hybrid attention and scaled additive aggregation achieving intention-aligned multimodal prediction without map reliance. The Motion-Aware Encoder builds scene-level intention prior via bounded scaled additive aggregation over mode-embedded trajectory tokens and refines per-mode representations under shared global context, mitigating inter-mode suppression and promoting intention alignment. The Hierarchical Interaction Decoder decomposes social reasoning into dual-pathway cross-attention: a standard pathway ensures uniform geometric coverage over agent-mode pairs while a neighbor-context-enhanced pathway emphasizes salient interactions, with gating module mediating their contributions to maintain coverage-focus balance. Experiments on eight highway-ramp scenarios from TOD-VT dataset show GContextFormer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Compared to existing transformer models, GContextFormer achieves greater robustness and concentrated improvements in high-curvature and transition zones via spatial distributions. Interpretability is achieved through motion mode distinctions and neighbor context modulation exposing reasoning attribution. The modular architecture supports extensibility toward cross-domain multimodal reasoning tasks. Source: https://fenghy-chen.github.io/sources/.

Conclusion: 该研究为ECDs提供了理论基础和评估工具，指导未来技术优化，显著帮助开发者提升ECDs的用户体验。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Language Models, dialogue systems are shifting from information tools to emotional companions, heralding the era of Emotional Companionship Dialogue Systems (ECDs) that provide personalized emotional support for users. However, the field lacks clear definitions and systematic evaluation standards for ECDs. To address this, we first propose a definition of ECDs with formal descriptions. Then, based on this theory and the design principle of "Ability Layer-Task Layer (three level)-Data Layer-Method Layer", we design and implement the first ECD evaluation benchmark - MoodBench 1.0. Through extensive evaluations of 30 mainstream models, we demonstrate that MoodBench 1.0 has excellent discriminant validity and can effectively quantify the differences in emotional companionship abilities among models. Furthermore, the results reveal current models' shortcomings in deep emotional companionship, guiding future technological optimization and significantly aiding developers in enhancing ECDs' user experience.

Motivation: 传统方法使用启发式方法分别处理利用和探索，而主动推理通过EFE最小化统一两者，但EFE最小化计算成本高昂，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 基于将EFE最小化重新表述为变分推断的理论，提出了一个新颖的消息传递方案，用于在因子状态MDP中实现可扩展的主动推理。

Result: 该方法克服了高维规划的难处理性，实现了在因子状态MDP中的可扩展主动推理。

Conclusion: 通过将主动推理与规划即推断统一起来，并开发有效的消息传递方案，成功解决了主动推理在复杂环境中的计算可扩展性问题。

Abstract: Automated decision-making under uncertainty requires balancing exploitation and exploration. Classical methods treat these separately using heuristics, while Active Inference unifies them through Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimization. However, EFE minimization is computationally expensive, limiting scalability. We build on recent theory recasting EFE minimization as variational inference, formally unifying it with Planning-as-Inference and showing the epistemic drive as a unique entropic contribution. Our main contribution is a novel message-passing scheme for this unified objective, enabling scalable Active Inference in factored-state MDPs and overcoming high-dimensional planning intractability.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现良好，但在系统视觉推理任务中经常产生不一致或不合逻辑的输出，而神经符号方法虽然能推导可解释的逻辑规则，但使用僵化的领域特定感知模块。

Method: VLP利用视觉语言模型生成结构化视觉描述，然后将其编译成神经符号程序。这些程序直接在图像上执行，保持与任务约束的一致性，并提供人类可解释的解释。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的实验表明，VLP在需要复杂逻辑推理的任务上优于直接和结构化提示方法。

Conclusion: VLP成功地将视觉语言模型的感知能力与程序合成的系统推理相结合，在视觉推理任务中实现了更好的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.

Motivation: 现有SLU数据集在真实场景表示上存在不足：环境上下文使用one-hot向量过于理想化，模型仅预测意图和槽标签而忽略了可提升性能和可解释性的推理过程。

Method: 使用GPT-4o和FLUX.1-dev生成反映用户环境和状态的图像，并通过人工验证确保质量；使用GPT-4o生成预测标签的解释，经人工标注者精炼确保准确性和连贯性；提出LR-Instruct指令模板，先预测标签再生成相应推理。

Result: 实验结果表明视觉信息的整合有效，显式推理在推进SLU方面具有前景。

Conclusion: VRSLU数据集通过整合视觉信息和显式推理，解决了SLU中的关键限制，为真实世界应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) consists of two sub-tasks: intent detection (ID) and slot filling (SF). Given its broad range of real-world applications, enhancing SLU for practical deployment is increasingly critical. Profile-based SLU addresses ambiguous user utterances by incorporating context awareness (CA), user profiles (UP), and knowledge graphs (KG) to support disambiguation, thereby advancing SLU research toward real-world applicability. However, existing SLU datasets still fall short in representing real-world scenarios. Specifically, (1) CA uses one-hot vectors for representation, which is overly idealized, and (2) models typically focuses solely on predicting intents and slot labels, neglecting the reasoning process that could enhance performance and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce VRSLU, a novel SLU dataset that integrates both Visual images and explicit Reasoning. For over-idealized CA, we use GPT-4o and FLUX.1-dev to generate images reflecting users' environments and statuses, followed by human verification to ensure quality. For reasoning, GPT-4o is employed to generate explanations for predicted labels, which are then refined by human annotators to ensure accuracy and coherence. Additionally, we propose an instructional template, LR-Instruct, which first predicts labels and then generates corresponding reasoning. This two-step approach helps mitigate the influence of reasoning bias on label prediction. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of incorporating visual information and highlight the promise of explicit reasoning in advancing SLU.

Abstract: Automata extraction is a method for synthesising interpretable surrogates for black-box neural models that can be analysed symbolically. Existing techniques assume a finite input alphabet, and thus are not directly applicable to data sequences drawn from continuous domains. We address this challenge with deterministic register automata (DRAs), which extend finite automata with registers that store and compare numeric values. Our main contribution is a framework for robust DRA extraction from black-box models: we develop a polynomial-time robustness checker for DRAs with a fixed number of registers, and combine it with passive and active automata learning algorithms. This combination yields surrogate DRAs with statistical robustness and equivalence guarantees. As a key application, we use the extracted automata to assess the robustness of neural networks: for a given sequence and distance metric, the DRA either certifies local robustness or produces a concrete counterexample. Experiments on recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures show that our framework reliably learns accurate automata and enables principled robustness evaluation. Overall, our results demonstrate that robust DRA extraction effectively bridges neural network interpretability and formal reasoning without requiring white-box access to the underlying network.

TL;DR: 论文澄清了AI意识与存在风险之间的混淆，指出智能而非意识是AI存在风险的直接预测因素，但意识在某些间接场景中可能影响风险水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于近期技术进步和媒体关注，AI存在风险和意识问题在科学辩论中日益突出，但这两个问题经常被混淆，需要澄清它们之间的关系。

Method: 通过理论分析区分意识和智能的概念，论证它们在经验上和理论上的区别，并探讨意识在AI存在风险中的潜在作用。

Result: 智能是AI存在风险的直接预测因素，而意识不是；但意识可能通过影响AI对齐或作为达到某些能力的前提条件而间接影响存在风险。

Conclusion: 区分意识和智能有助于AI安全研究者和政策制定者关注最紧迫的问题，避免在意识问题上分散注意力。

Abstract: In AI, the existential risk denotes the hypothetical threat posed by an artificial system that would possess both the capability and the objective, either directly or indirectly, to eradicate humanity. This issue is gaining prominence in scientific debate due to recent technical advancements and increased media coverage. In parallel, AI progress has sparked speculation and studies about the potential emergence of artificial consciousness. The two questions, AI consciousness and existential risk, are sometimes conflated, as if the former entailed the latter. Here, I explain that this view stems from a common confusion between consciousness and intelligence. Yet these two properties are empirically and theoretically distinct. Arguably, while intelligence is a direct predictor of an AI system's existential threat, consciousness is not. There are, however, certain incidental scenarios in which consciousness could influence existential risk, in either direction. Consciousness could be viewed as a means towards AI alignment, thereby lowering existential risk; or, it could be a precondition for reaching certain capabilities or levels of intelligence, and thus positively related to existential risk. Recognizing these distinctions can help AI safety researchers and public policymakers focus on the most pressing issues.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提高了视觉语言模型在基于EEG的睡眠分期分类中的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: EEG-VLM在临床环境中具有自动化和可解释的EEG分析潜力。

Abstract: Sleep stage classification based on electroencephalography (EEG) is fundamental for assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep-related disorders. However, most traditional machine learning methods rely heavily on prior knowledge and handcrafted features, while existing deep learning models still struggle to jointly capture fine-grained time-frequency patterns and achieve clinical interpretability. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in the medical domain, yet their performance remains constrained when applied to physiological waveform data, especially EEG signals, due to their limited visual understanding and insufficient reasoning capability. To address these challenges, we propose EEG-VLM, a hierarchical vision-language framework that integrates multi-level feature alignment with visually enhanced language-guided reasoning for interpretable EEG-based sleep stage classification. Specifically, a specialized visual enhancement module constructs high-level visual tokens from intermediate-layer features to extract rich semantic representations of EEG images. These tokens are further aligned with low-level CLIP features through a multi-level alignment mechanism, enhancing the VLM's image-processing capability. In addition, a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy decomposes complex medical inference into interpretable logical steps, effectively simulating expert-like decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves both the accuracy and interpretability of VLMs in EEG-based sleep stage classification, showing promising potential for automated and explainable EEG analysis in clinical settings.

Conclusion: SimDiff通过单阶段端到端框架成功解决了扩散模型在时间序列点预测中的局限性，无需依赖外部模型即可实现高性能点估计。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promise in time series forecasting, particularly for probabilistic predictions. However, they often fail to achieve state-of-the-art point estimation performance compared to regression-based methods. This limitation stems from difficulties in providing sufficient contextual bias to track distribution shifts and in balancing output diversity with the stability and precision required for point forecasts. Existing diffusion-based approaches mainly focus on full-distribution modeling under probabilistic frameworks, often with likelihood maximization objectives, while paying little attention to dedicated strategies for high-accuracy point estimation. Moreover, other existing point prediction diffusion methods frequently rely on pre-trained or jointly trained mature models for contextual bias, sacrificing the generative flexibility of diffusion models.
  To address these challenges, we propose SimDiff, a single-stage, end-to-end framework. SimDiff employs a single unified Transformer network carefully tailored to serve as both denoiser and predictor, eliminating the need for external pre-trained or jointly trained regressors. It achieves state-of-the-art point estimation performance by leveraging intrinsic output diversity and improving mean squared error accuracy through multiple inference ensembling. Key innovations, including normalization independence and the median-of-means estimator, further enhance adaptability and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimDiff significantly outperforms existing methods in time series point forecasting.

Abstract: We develop a moduli-theoretic view of psychometric test batteries for AI agents and connect it explicitly to the AAI score developed previously. First, we make precise the notion of an AAI functional on a battery and set out axioms that any reasonable autonomy/general intelligence score should satisfy. Second, we show that the composite index ('AAI-Index') defined previously is a special case of our AAI functional. Third, we introduce the notion of a cognitive core of an agent relative to a battery and define the associated AAI$_{\textrm{core}}$ score as the restriction of an AAI functional to that core. Finally, we use these notions to describe invariants of batteries under evaluation-preserving symmetries and outline how moduli of equivalent batteries are organized.

TL;DR: 提出了AutoEnv框架和AutoEnv-36数据集，用于研究智能体在异构环境中的跨环境学习能力，发现固定学习方法难以适应多环境，需要环境自适应选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体通常在单一环境中自我进化，而人类能够适应不同动态、观察和奖励结构的环境。缺乏标准化的异构环境集合和统一的智能体学习表示方法。

Method: 1) 提出AutoEnv框架，将环境分解为转移、观察和奖励的分布，低成本生成异构世界；2) 构建AutoEnv-36数据集(36个环境，358个验证关卡)；3) 将智能体学习形式化为组件中心过程，包含选择、优化和评估三个阶段；4) 设计8种学习方法并进行评估。

Result: 1) 7个语言模型在AutoEnv-36上获得12-49%的归一化奖励，显示其挑战性；2) 单一学习方法的收益随环境数量增加而快速下降；3) 环境自适应学习方法选择显著提升性能，但随方法空间扩展而收益递减。

Conclusion: 固定学习方法无法扩展到异构环境，需要环境自适应策略。AutoEnv和AutoEnv-36为研究跨环境智能体学习提供了测试平台，突显了可扩展跨环境泛化的必要性和当前局限性。

Abstract: Humans naturally adapt to diverse environments by learning underlying rules across worlds with different dynamics, observations, and reward structures. In contrast, existing agents typically demonstrate improvements via self-evolving within a single domain, implicitly assuming a fixed environment distribution. Cross-environment learning has remained largely unmeasured: there is no standard collection of controllable, heterogeneous environments, nor a unified way to represent how agents learn. We address these gaps in two steps. First, we propose AutoEnv, an automated framework that treats environments as factorizable distributions over transitions, observations, and rewards, enabling low-cost (4.12 USD on average) generation of heterogeneous worlds. Using AutoEnv, we construct AutoEnv-36, a dataset of 36 environments with 358 validated levels, on which seven language models achieve 12-49% normalized reward, demonstrating the challenge of AutoEnv-36. Second, we formalize agent learning as a component-centric process driven by three stages of Selection, Optimization, and Evaluation applied to an improvable agent component. Using this formulation, we design eight learning methods and evaluate them on AutoEnv-36. Empirically, the gain of any single learning method quickly decrease as the number of environments increases, revealing that fixed learning methods do not scale across heterogeneous environments. Environment-adaptive selection of learning methods substantially improves performance but exhibits diminishing returns as the method space expands. These results highlight both the necessity and the current limitations of agent learning for scalable cross-environment generalization, and position AutoEnv and AutoEnv-36 as a testbed for studying cross-environment agent learning. The code is avaiable at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/AutoEnv.

TL;DR: PRInTS是一个生成式过程奖励模型，通过密集评分和轨迹摘要来解决多步信息搜索任务中的挑战，显著提升了开源模型和专业代理的信息搜索能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的过程奖励模型(PRMs)设计用于短推理和二元判断，无法捕捉信息搜索步骤中的丰富维度（如工具交互、工具输出推理），也无法处理长视野任务中快速增长的上下文。

Method: 引入PRInTS，一个具有双重能力的生成式PRM：(1)基于多个步骤质量维度的密集评分；(2)轨迹摘要，压缩增长上下文同时保留步骤评估所需的关键信息。

Result: 在FRAMES、GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中，使用PRInTS的最佳-n采样显著提升了开源模型和专业代理的信息搜索能力，匹配或超越了前沿模型的性能，且使用更小的骨干代理。

Conclusion: PRInTS通过其双重能力有效解决了长视野信息搜索任务中的挑战，为AI代理的信息搜索能力提供了显著改进。

Abstract: Information-seeking is a core capability for AI agents, requiring them to gather and reason over tool-generated information across long trajectories. However, such multi-step information-seeking tasks remain challenging for agents backed by language models. While process reward models (PRMs) can guide agents by ranking candidate steps at test-time, existing PRMs, designed for short reasoning with binary judgment, cannot capture richer dimensions of information-seeking steps, such as tool interactions and reasoning over tool outputs, nor handle the rapidly growing context in long-horizon tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce PRInTS, a generative PRM trained with dual capabilities: (1) dense scoring based on the PRM's reasoning across multiple step quality dimensions (e.g., interpretation of tool outputs, tool call informativeness) and (2) trajectory summarization that compresses the growing context while preserving essential information for step evaluation. Extensive evaluations across FRAMES, GAIA (levels 1-3), and WebWalkerQA (easy-hard) benchmarks on multiple models, along with ablations, reveal that best-of-n sampling with PRInTS enhances information-seeking abilities of open-source models as well as specialized agents, matching or surpassing the performance of frontier models with a much smaller backbone agent and outperforming other strong reward modeling baselines.

Motivation: 传统3D运动合成依赖昂贵的动作捕捉，而现有方法要么基于文本描述生成运动，要么仅依赖视频条件，导致生成的运动动态与真实世界运动统计之间存在差距。

Conclusion: MotionDuet通过视频和文本的双重条件，结合分布感知的结构协调，成功生成了高质量且可控的3D人体运动。

Abstract: 3D Human motion generation is pivotal across film, animation, gaming, and embodied intelligence. Traditional 3D motion synthesis relies on costly motion capture, while recent work shows that 2D videos provide rich, temporally coherent observations of human behavior. Existing approaches, however, either map high-level text descriptions to motion or rely solely on video conditioning, leaving a gap between generated dynamics and real-world motion statistics. We introduce MotionDuet, a multimodal framework that aligns motion generation with the distribution of video-derived representations. In this dual-conditioning paradigm, video cues extracted from a pretrained model (e.g., VideoMAE) ground low-level motion dynamics, while textual prompts provide semantic intent. To bridge the distribution gap across modalities, we propose Dual-stream Unified Encoding and Transformation (DUET) and a Distribution-Aware Structural Harmonization (DASH) loss. DUET fuses video-informed cues into the motion latent space via unified encoding and dynamic attention, while DASH aligns motion trajectories with both distributional and structural statistics of video features. An auto-guidance mechanism further balances textual and visual signals by leveraging a weakened copy of the model, enhancing controllability without sacrificing diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionDuet generates realistic and controllable human motions, surpassing strong state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Real-time simulation of deformable objects relies on model reduction to achieve interactive performance while maintaining physical fidelity. Traditional linear methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), provide structured and predictable behavior thanks to their linear formulation, but are limited in expressiveness. Nonlinear model reduction, typically implemented with neural networks, offers richer representations and higher compression; however, without structural constraints, the learned mappings often fail to generalize beyond the training distribution, leading to unstable or implausible deformations. We present a symmetric, convex-inspired neural formulation that bridges the gap between linear and nonlinear model reduction. Our approach adopts an input-convex neural network (ICNN) augmented with symmetry constraints to impose structure on the nonlinear decoder. This design retains the flexibility of neural mappings while embedding physical consistency, yielding coherent and stable displacements even under unseen conditions. We evaluate our method on challenging deformation scenarios involving forces of different magnitudes, inverse directions, and sparsely sampled training data. Our approach demonstrates superior generalization while maintaining compact reduced spaces, and supports real-time interactive applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强拓扑和几何感知能力，成功解决了现有逆渲染方法在高亏格表面重建中的局限性，在保持拓扑特征的同时提升了表面细节质量。

Abstract: We present a topology-informed inverse rendering approach for reconstructing high-genus surface meshes from multi-view images. Compared to 3D representations like voxels and point clouds, mesh-based representations are preferred as they enable the application of differential geometry theory and are optimized for modern graphics pipelines. However, existing inverse rendering methods often fail catastrophically on high-genus surfaces, leading to the loss of key topological features, and tend to oversmooth low-genus surfaces, resulting in the loss of surface details. This failure stems from their overreliance on Adam-based optimizers, which can lead to vanishing and exploding gradients. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an adaptive V-cycle remeshing scheme in conjunction with a re-parametrized Adam optimizer to enhance topological and geometric awareness. By periodically coarsening and refining the deforming mesh, our method informs mesh vertices of their current topology and geometry before optimization, mitigating gradient issues while preserving essential topological features. Additionally, we enforce topological consistency by constructing topological primitives with genus numbers that match those of ground truth using Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Experimental results demonstrate that our inverse rendering approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method, achieving significant improvements in Chamfer Distance and Volume IoU, particularly for high-genus surfaces, while also enhancing surface details for low-genus surfaces.

Abstract: Multi-period image collections are common in real-world applications. Cities are re-scanned for mapping, construction sites are revisited for progress tracking, and natural regions are monitored for environmental change. Such data form multi-period scenes, where geometry and appearance evolve. Reconstructing such scenes is an important yet underexplored problem. Existing pipelines rely on incompatible assumptions: static and in-the-wild methods enforce a single geometry, while dynamic ones assume smooth motion, both failing under long-term, discontinuous changes. To solve this problem, we introduce ChronoGS, a temporally modulated Gaussian representation that reconstructs all periods within a unified anchor scaffold. It's also designed to disentangle stable and evolving components, achieving temporally consistent reconstruction of multi-period scenes. To catalyze relevant research, we release ChronoScene dataset, a benchmark of real and synthetic multi-period scenes, capturing geometric and appearance variation. Experiments demonstrate that ChronoGS consistently outperforms baselines in reconstruction quality and temporal consistency. Our code and the ChronoScene dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/ZhongtaoWang/ChronoGS.

Abstract: The efficient reconstruction of high-quality and intuitively editable human avatars presents a pressing challenge in the field of computer vision. Recent advancements, such as 3DGS, have demonstrated impressive reconstruction efficiency and rapid rendering speeds. However, intuitive local editing of these representations remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose AvatarBrush, a framework that reconstructs fully animatable and locally editable avatars using only a monocular video input. We propose a three-layer model to represent the avatar and, inspired by mesh morphing techniques, design a framework to generate the Gaussian model from local information of the parametric body model. Compared to previous methods that require scanned meshes or multi-view captures as input, our approach reduces costs and enhances editing capabilities such as body shape adjustment, local texture modification, and geometry transfer. Our experimental results demonstrate superior quality across two datasets and emphasize the enhanced, user-friendly, and localized editing capabilities of our method.
