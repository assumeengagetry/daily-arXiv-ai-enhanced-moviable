TL;DR: DD-MDN：一种端到端概率人类轨迹预测模型，结合高位置精度、校准不确定性和短观测鲁棒性，使用少样本去噪扩散骨干和双重混合密度网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出DD-MDN模型，采用少样本去噪扩散骨干和双重混合密度网络，学习自校准驻留区域和概率排序的锚点路径，从中推导多样化的轨迹假设，无需预定义锚点或端点。

Result: 在ETH/UCY、SDD、inD和IMPTC数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的准确性、短观测间隔下的鲁棒性以及可靠的不确定性建模。

Conclusion: DD-MDN通过结合去噪扩散和混合密度网络，有效解决了人类轨迹预测中的不确定性校准和短观测鲁棒性问题，为下游应用提供了更可靠的预测结果。

Abstract: Human Trajectory Forecasting (HTF) predicts future human movements from past trajectories and environmental context, with applications in Autonomous Driving, Smart Surveillance, and Human-Robot Interaction. While prior work has focused on accuracy, social interaction modeling, and diversity, little attention has been paid to uncertainty modeling, calibration, and forecasts from short observation periods, which are crucial for downstream tasks such as path planning and collision avoidance. We propose DD-MDN, an end-to-end probabilistic HTF model that combines high positional accuracy, calibrated uncertainty, and robustness to short observations. Using a few-shot denoising diffusion backbone and a dual mixture density network, our method learns self-calibrated residence areas and probability-ranked anchor paths, from which diverse trajectory hypotheses are derived, without predefined anchors or endpoints. Experiments on the ETH/UCY, SDD, inD, and IMPTC datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, robustness at short observation intervals, and reliable uncertainty modeling.

TL;DR: ABot-M0框架通过统一数据管道和动作流形学习，构建通用具身智能体，支持跨硬件平台的知识迁移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能中"一个大脑，多种形态"的挑战，克服数据碎片化、表示不一致和训练目标不匹配的问题

Method: 1) 构建UniACT-dataset统一数据集；2) 提出动作流形假设和AML方法；3) 双流感知机制集成VLM语义和几何先验

Result: 从6个公开数据集构建了包含600万轨迹、9500小时数据的UniACT-dataset，组件独立运行且有叠加效益

Conclusion: ABot-M0框架通过系统化数据管理和动作流形学习，实现了跨硬件平台的通用具身智能，将发布代码促进研究

Abstract: Building general-purpose embodied agents across diverse hardware remains a central challenge in robotics, often framed as the ''one-brain, many-forms'' paradigm. Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits. We will release all code and pipelines for reproducibility and future research.

TL;DR: 基于TeaLeafBD数据集开发深度学习模型用于茶叶病害分类，EfficientNetB3达到93%准确率，DenseNet201达到91%，通过对抗训练增强鲁棒性，使用Grad-CAM进行可解释性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 茶叶是孟加拉国重要经济作物，但叶片病害会影响产量和质量。人工检测耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案来提升病害检测效率和准确性。

Method: 使用TeaLeafBD数据集（5,278张高分辨率图像，7个类别），采用数据预处理、数据分割、对抗训练、数据增强等流程。使用DenseNet201和EfficientNetB3进行病害分类，通过对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性，并采用Grad-CAM进行可解释性分析。

Result: EfficientNetB3达到93%最高分类准确率，DenseNet201达到91%。模型能够有效识别茶叶病害，对抗训练使模型在噪声或干扰输入下仍能有效工作。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习方法能准确检测茶叶病害，为现代农业管理提供实用解决方案。模型的高准确率和可解释性使其适用于实际农业应用。

Abstract: Tea is a valuable asset for the economy of Bangladesh. So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%. The outcomes prove that the effectiveness of the proposed approach can accurately detect tea leaf diseases and provide a practical solution for advanced agricultural management.

### [4] [Active Zero: Self-Evolving Vision-Language Models through Active Environment Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11241)
*Jinghan He,Junfeng Fang,Feng Xiong,Zijun Yao,Fei Shen,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang,Tat-Seng Chua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Active-Zero框架通过主动探索视觉环境而非被动交互，让视觉语言模型自主构建学习轨迹，显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型的自对弈方法依赖于与静态图像集的被动交互，导致对初始数据集的强依赖和低效学习。模型无法主动寻找适合其能力发展的视觉数据，浪费计算资源在过于简单或超出当前能力的数据上。

Method: 提出Active-Zero框架，包含三个协同进化的智能体：1) Searcher从开放世界库中根据模型能力边界检索图像；2) Questioner合成校准的推理任务；3) Solver通过准确性奖励进行精炼。形成闭环的自脚手架自动课程学习。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct模型上，在12个基准测试中，推理任务平均准确率达到53.97%（提升5.7%），通用理解达到59.77%（提升3.9%），一致优于现有自对弈基线方法。

Conclusion: 主动探索是构建可扩展和自适应自进化视觉语言系统的关键要素，Active-Zero框架通过主动环境探索实现了更高效的自对弈学习。

Abstract: Self-play has enabled large language models to autonomously improve through self-generated challenges. However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines. These results highlight active exploration as a key ingredient for scalable and adaptive self-evolving vision-language systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReTracing是一个多智能体具身表演艺术项目，采用考古学方法研究AI如何塑造、约束和产生身体运动。通过科幻小说提取人机交互描述，使用LLM生成"做什么"和"不做什么"的提示，再用扩散模型转换为人类表演者和四足机器人的动作指导，最终通过运动捕捉创建数字运动档案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该项目旨在探索生成式系统如何通过编排的动作编码社会文化偏见，并探讨在AI也能移动、思考和留下痕迹的时代，作为人类意味着什么这一关键问题。

Method: 1) 从科幻小说中提取描述人机交互的句子；2) 使用大语言模型为每个摘录生成"做什么"和"不做什么"的配对提示；3) 使用基于扩散的文本到视频模型将提示转换为人类表演者的编舞指导和机器人的运动指令；4) 在镜面地板上执行动作，通过多摄像头运动捕捉系统记录；5) 重建为3D点云和运动轨迹，形成数字运动档案。

Result: 创建了一个沉浸式的AI、人类和机器人互动表演，生成了数字化的运动痕迹档案，揭示了生成系统如何通过编排动作编码社会文化偏见。

Conclusion: ReTracing提供了一种新颖的方法来揭示生成系统如何通过编排动作编码社会文化偏见，同时提出了在AI时代关于人类本质的深刻问题，通过艺术形式探讨了技术如何塑造身体运动和社会规范。

Abstract: We present ReTracing, a multi-agent embodied performance art that adopts an archaeological approach to examine how artificial intelligence shapes, constrains, and produces bodily movement. Drawing from science-fiction novels, the project extracts sentences that describe human-machine interaction. We use large language models (LLMs) to generate paired prompts "what to do" and "what not to do" for each excerpt. A diffusion-based text-to-video model transforms these prompts into choreographic guides for a human performer and motor commands for a quadruped robot. Both agents enact the actions on a mirrored floor, captured by multi-camera motion tracking and reconstructed into 3D point clouds and motion trails, forming a digital archive of motion traces. Through this process, ReTracing serves as a novel approach to reveal how generative systems encode socio-cultural biases through choreographed movements. Through an immersive interplay of AI, human, and robot, ReTracing confronts a critical question of our time: What does it mean to be human among AIs that also move, think, and leave traces behind?

TL;DR: 该研究创建了REVEAL诊断基准，发现当前视频语言模型在时序理解、运动感知等方面存在严重缺陷，而人类能轻松完成这些任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频语言模型是否真正理解视频内容、时序和运动，发现现有模型存在严重缺陷，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 开发REVEAL诊断基准，包含五个压力测试：时序期望偏差、语言捷径依赖、视频奉承、相机运动敏感性和时空遮挡鲁棒性，并构建自动生成诊断示例的数据管道。

Result: 测试主流开源和闭源视频语言模型发现：模型会自信地描述反向场景为正向、回答问题忽略视频内容、同意错误主张、难以处理基本相机运动、无法在简单时空遮挡下聚合时序信息。

Conclusion: 当前视频语言模型在基础视频理解能力上存在严重不足，需要更严格的评估和模型改进，REVEAL基准和数据管道将支持未来研究。

Abstract: This work investigates a fundamental question: Do Video-Language Models (VidLMs) robustly account for video content, temporal sequence, and motion? Our investigation shows that, surprisingly, they often do not. We introduce REVEAL{}, a diagnostic benchmark that probes fundamental weaknesses of contemporary VidLMs through five controlled stress tests; assessing temporal expectation bias, reliance on language-only shortcuts, video sycophancy, camera motion sensitivity, and robustness to spatiotemporal occlusion. We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation. We will release our benchmark and code to support future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前从真实物体生成3D模型的摄影测量方法存在多种设计选择，但这些方法的差异主要通过定性评估，缺乏可重复的量化比较

Method: 开发了一个新流程，从高质量3D模型和程序生成的相机位姿生成合成图像，创建可重复的量化实验环境

Result: 该流程能够将虚拟相机参数和虚拟物体的真实信息与重建估计进行对比，实现各种可重复的量化实验

Conclusion: 提出的合成图像生成流程为评估不同摄影测量方法提供了可靠的量化基准测试框架

Abstract: The generation of 3D models from real-world objects has often been accomplished through photogrammetry, i.e., by taking 2D photos from a variety of perspectives and then triangulating matched point-based features to create a textured mesh. Many design choices exist within this framework for the generation of digital twins, and differences between such approaches are largely judged qualitatively. Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses. This enables a wide variety of repeatable, quantifiable experiments which can compare ground-truth knowledge of virtual camera parameters and of virtual objects against the reconstructed estimations of those perspectives and subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TexSpot是一个基于扩散的纹理增强框架，通过新颖的Texlet 3D纹理表示，解决了多视角扩散管道中的视图不一致问题，显著提升了3D纹理生成的视觉保真度和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的多视角扩散管道存在视图不一致问题，现有表示方法要么依赖UV贴图（展开时会产生扭曲），要么使用点云方法（纹理保真度受几何密度限制），难以生成高质量的3D纹理。

Method: 提出TexSpot框架，核心是Texlet表示法：结合了点云3D纹理的几何表现力和UV表示的紧凑性。每个Texlet潜在向量通过2D编码器编码局部纹理块，再通过3D编码器聚合全局形状上下文。使用级联3D到2D解码器重建高质量纹理块，并训练基于Texlet的扩散变换器来增强多视角扩散方法生成的纹理。

Result: 大量实验表明，TexSpot在视觉保真度、几何一致性和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有的最先进3D纹理生成和增强方法。

Conclusion: TexSpot通过创新的Texlet表示和扩散变换器，有效解决了3D纹理生成中的视图不一致问题，为高质量3D纹理生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality 3D texture generation remains a fundamental challenge due to the view-inconsistency inherent in current mainstream multi-view diffusion pipelines. Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

### [9] [Selective Prior Synchronization via SYNC Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11316)
*Ishan Mishra,Jiajie Li,Deepak Mishra,Jinjun Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SYNC损失函数，将后验选择方法（softmax响应）的选择先验整合到SelectiveNet的训练过程中，提升选择性预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前选择性预测方法分为两类：专门设计的网络架构（ad-hoc）和基于模型输出的后处理方法（post-hoc）。作者发现后处理方法隐含产生的选择先验信息仅在推理阶段使用，而该信息对训练阶段同样重要

Method: 提出SYNC损失函数，将softmax响应整合到SelectiveNet的训练过程中，通过检查选择先验来增强选择性预测能力

Result: 在CIFAR-100、ImageNet-100和Stanford Cars等数据集上评估，不仅提升了模型的泛化能力，而且在选择性预测性能上超越了先前工作，创造了新的最先进性能基准

Conclusion: 通过将后验方法的选择先验整合到ad-hoc方法的训练过程中，SYNC损失实现了两种方法的优势互补，显著提升了选择性预测性能

Abstract: Prediction under uncertainty is a critical requirement for the deep neural network to succeed responsibly. This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种将学习深度先验集成到VINS-Mono优化后端的新框架，通过仿射不变深度一致性和成对序数约束，在边缘设备上实现实时、鲁棒的视觉惯性里程计


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单目VIO系统在低纹理环境中表现不佳，稀疏视觉特征不足以进行准确的姿态估计。虽然基于ViT的复杂基础模型能提供密集、几何一致的深度，但计算需求大，无法在边缘设备上实时部署。

Method: 提出新框架，将学习深度先验直接集成到VINS-Mono优化后端，强制执行仿射不变深度一致性和成对序数约束，通过基于方差的门控机制显式过滤不稳定伪影。

Result: 在TartanGround和M3ED数据集上的实验表明，该方法在挑战性场景中防止发散，显著提高精度，绝对轨迹误差(ATE)降低高达28.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在严格遵循边缘设备计算限制的同时，鲁棒地恢复度量尺度，为低纹理环境下的实时视觉惯性里程计提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional monocular Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) systems struggle in low-texture environments where sparse visual features are insufficient for accurate pose estimation. To address this, dense Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) has been widely explored as a complementary information source. While recent Vision Transformer (ViT) based complex foundational models offer dense, geometrically consistent depth, their computational demands typically preclude them from real-time edge deployment. Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale. Extensive experiments on the TartanGround and M3ED datasets demonstrate that our method prevents divergence in challenging scenarios and delivers significant accuracy gains, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by up to 28.3%. Code will be made available.

Conclusion: StreamSR数据集和EfRLFN模型有效解决了压缩视频实时超分辨率的挑战，为流媒体应用提供了更相关的评估基准和高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in real-time super-resolution have enabled higher-quality video streaming, yet existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of compressed video content. Commonly used datasets do not accurately reflect the characteristics of streaming media, limiting the relevance of current benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive dataset - StreamSR - sourced from YouTube, covering a wide range of video genres and resolutions representative of real-world streaming scenarios. We benchmark 11 state-of-the-art real-time super-resolution models to evaluate their performance for the streaming use-case.
  Furthermore, we propose EfRLFN, an efficient real-time model that integrates Efficient Channel Attention and a hyperbolic tangent activation function - a novel design choice in the context of real-time super-resolution. We extensively optimized the architecture to maximize efficiency and designed a composite loss function that improves training convergence. EfRLFN combines the strengths of existing architectures while improving both visual quality and runtime performance.
  Finally, we show that fine-tuning other models on our dataset results in significant performance gains that generalize well across various standard benchmarks. We made the dataset, the code, and the benchmark available at https://github.com/EvgeneyBogatyrev/EfRLFN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术史文章常讨论艺术品整体及特定部分（布局、图像学、物质文化等），但观看艺术品时难以快速了解不同文章对作品的论述，需要系统化的信息整合方法

Method: 1. 构建新颖的语料收集管道，整合开放获取艺术史文章和Wikidata知识；2. 使用低秩适应（LoRA）技术定制CLIP模型，使其适应艺术领域；3. 通过弱监督学习训练PaintingCLIP模型

Result: PaintingCLIP模型在性能上超越原始CLIP模型，能够为给定艺术品提供有效的上下文信息，证明弱监督学习的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的ArtContext管道具有通用性，可轻松应用于众多人文学科领域，为艺术品研究提供系统化的信息注释解决方案

Abstract: Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.

*Alan Baade,Eric Ryan Chan,Kyle Sargent,Changan Chen,Justin Johnson,Ehsan Adeli,Li Fei-Fei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Forcing是一种改进潜在扩散模型的方法，通过在去噪过程中联合处理潜在表示和原始像素，使用分别调优的噪声调度，使潜在表示作为中间计算的"草稿纸"，从而在保持效率的同时直接在原始图像上操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但存在三个主要问题：1）在图像编码过程中丢弃信息；2）需要单独训练的解码器；3）建模的是原始数据的辅助分布而非原始数据本身。这些缺点使得模型失去了端到端建模的优势。

Method: 提出Latent Forcing方法，通过联合处理潜在表示和原始像素，使用分别调优的噪声调度来排序去噪轨迹。潜在表示在生成高频像素特征之前作为中间计算的"草稿纸"。特别研究了条件信号顺序的重要性，并分析了REPA蒸馏、条件与非条件生成、以及分词器重建质量与可扩散性之间的关系。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，Latent Forcing在扩散变换器为基础的像素生成任务中，在作者的计算规模下达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: Latent Forcing通过简单修改现有架构，实现了潜在扩散的效率优势，同时直接在原始自然图像上操作，解决了传统潜在扩散模型的局限性，为扩散模型提供了更有效的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images but lose the benefits of end-to-end modeling. They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.

Abstract: The anisotropic nature of short-axis (SAX) cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) limits cardiac shape analysis. To address this, we propose to leverage near-isotropic, higher resolution computed tomography angiography (CTA) data of the heart. We use this data to train a single neural implicit function to jointly represent cardiac shapes from CMRI at any resolution. We evaluate the method for the reconstruction of right ventricle (RV) and myocardium (MYO), where MYO simultaneously models endocardial and epicardial left-ventricle surfaces. Since high-resolution SAX reference segmentations are unavailable, we evaluate performance by extracting a 4-chamber (4CH) slice of RV and MYO from their reconstructed shapes. When compared with the reference 4CH segmentation masks from CMRI, our method achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.07 and 0.75 $\pm$ 0.13, and a Hausdorff distance of 6.21 $\pm$ 3.97 mm and 7.53 $\pm$ 5.13 mm for RV and MYO, respectively. Quantitative and qualitative assessment demonstrate the model's ability to reconstruct accurate, smooth and anatomically plausible shapes, supporting improvements in cardiac shape analysis.

Conclusion: Ctrl&Shift通过创新的两阶段扩散框架成功解决了物体操控中的几何一致性挑战，实现了背景保持、精确几何控制和良好泛化能力的统一，为电影后期、AR和创意编辑提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Object-level manipulation, relocating or reorienting objects in images or videos while preserving scene realism, is central to film post-production, AR, and creative editing. Yet existing methods struggle to jointly achieve three core goals: background preservation, geometric consistency under viewpoint shifts, and user-controllable transformations. Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify fine-grained geometric control and real-world generalization for object manipulation, without relying on any explicit 3D modeling.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于超低场磁共振扩散张量成像的贝叶斯偏置场校正算法和基于卷积神经网络的超分辨率算法，能够恢复白质微结构和体积信息，并改善阿尔茨海默病分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低场磁共振成像虽然便携且有望扩大神经影像学应用范围，但存在空间分辨率低、角度分辨率差、信噪比低等问题。扩散张量成像特别容易受到这些成像质量下降的影响，且存在空间和角度域伪影，需要专门的校正算法。

Result: 通过合成下采样实验和真实匹配的超低场与高场DTI扫描对比，证明这些算法能够恢复超低场下的白质微结构和体积信息。DiffSR还能直接应用于阿尔茨海默病分类，显著改善DTI指标间的一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够有效提升超低场扩散张量成像质量，恢复白质信息，并改善疾病分类性能。作者公开了贝叶斯偏置校正算法和DiffSR代码，旨在推动超低场重建方法和DTI序列标准化研究。

Abstract: Portable, ultra-low-field (ULF) magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to expand access to neuroimaging but currently suffers from coarse spatial and angular resolutions and low signal-to-noise ratios. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization. We release all code related to DiffSR for $\href{https://github.com/markolchanyi/DiffSR}{public \space use}$.

Abstract: Semantic Change Detection (SCD) aims to detect and categorize land-cover changes from bi-temporal remote sensing images. Existing methods often suffer from blurred boundaries and inadequate temporal modeling, limiting segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a Dual-Branch Framework for Semantic Change Detection with Boundary and Temporal Awareness, termed DBTANet. Specifically, we utilize a dual-branch Siamese encoder where a frozen SAM branch captures global semantic context and boundary priors, while a ResNet34 branch provides local spatial details, ensuring complementary feature representations. On this basis, we design a Bidirectional Temporal Awareness Module (BTAM) to aggregate multi-scale features and capture temporal dependencies in a symmetric manner. Furthermore, a Gaussian-smoothed Projection Module (GSPM) refines shallow SAM features, suppressing noise while enhancing edge information for boundary-aware constraints. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that DBTANet effectively integrates global semantics, local details, temporal reasoning, and boundary awareness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征压缩方法通常需要为特定压缩比训练专用模型，缺乏灵活性，当需要新压缩比时需要重新训练，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出ARFC框架，核心是自回归模型ARC，通过控制生成token数量实现任意压缩比。引入MoS模块利用多个压缩结果减少不确定性，集成ERGC约束保持语义和结构关系。

Result: 在跨模态检索、图像分类和图像检索等多个任务和数据集上，ARFC在不同压缩比下均优于现有方法，某些情况下甚至超过原始未压缩特征。

Conclusion: ARFC框架有效解决了特征压缩的灵活性问题，单一模型支持任意压缩比，在资源受限场景下具有实用性和通用性。

Abstract: Feature compression is increasingly important for improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, especially in applications involving large-scale or multi-modal data. While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.

Conclusion: ImagineAgent通过协调认知推理与生成想象，有效解决了开放词汇人-物交互中的跨模态对齐问题，为模糊场景下的视觉理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models have shown promising capabilities in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reasoning capabilities in Open-Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (OV-HOI) are limited by cross-modal hallucinations and occlusion-induced ambiguity. To address this, we propose \textbf{ImagineAgent}, an agentic framework that harmonizes cognitive reasoning with generative imagination for robust visual understanding. Specifically, our method innovatively constructs cognitive maps that explicitly model plausible relationships between detected entities and candidate actions. Subsequently, it dynamically invokes tools including retrieval augmentation, image cropping, and diffusion models to gather domain-specific knowledge and enriched visual evidence, thereby achieving cross-modal alignment in ambiguous scenarios. Moreover, we propose a composite reward that balances prediction accuracy and tool efficiency. Evaluations on SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets demonstrate our SOTA performance, requiring approximately 20\% of training data compared to existing methods, validating our robustness and efficiency.

Motivation: X射线血管造影是心血管疾病的金标准成像方式，但当前深度学习方法受限于标注数据稀缺。大规模自监督学习在该领域潜力尚未充分探索，缺乏有效的SSL框架和大规模数据集

Conclusion: VasoMIM作为基础模型在X射线血管造影分析任务中具有显著潜力，将推动该领域发展。框架和数据集将开源

Abstract: X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date. We validate VasoMIM on four downstream tasks across six datasets, where it demonstrates superior transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. These findings highlight the significant potential of VasoMIM as a foundation model for advancing a wide range of X-ray angiogram analysis tasks. VasoMIM and XA-170K will be available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/XA-SSL.

Conclusion: 提出的MFdiff模型成功解决了多模态融合和分布外数据挑战，实现了高质量PET图像恢复，为低剂量PET成像提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) offers powerful functional imaging but involves radiation exposure. Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: 生成压缩框架为感知去噪提供了有效解决方案，通过压缩潜在表示强制结构简单性，结合生成模型恢复真实纹理，在失真和感知之间取得了良好平衡，为图像去噪提供了新的理论保证和实践方法。

Abstract: Image denoising aims to remove noise while preserving structural details and perceptual realism, yet distortion-driven methods often produce over-smoothed reconstructions, especially under strong noise and distribution shift. This paper proposes a generative compression framework for perception-based denoising, where restoration is achieved by reconstructing from entropy-coded latent representations that enforce low-complexity structure, while generative decoders recover realistic textures via perceptual measures such as learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) loss and Wasserstein distance. Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents. We further establish non-asymptotic guarantees for the compression-based maximum-likelihood denoiser under additive Gaussian noise, including bounds on reconstruction error and decoding error probability. Experiments on synthetic and real-noise benchmarks demonstrate consistent perceptual improvements while maintaining competitive distortion performance.

Motivation: 多智能体系统在V2X协同感知中面临快速领域自适应的挑战。现有PEFT方法直接应用于多智能体设置会导致性能显著下降和训练不稳定，主要原因是异构传感器流中的帧间冗余和PEFT适应下深层表示中细粒度语义的侵蚀。

Conclusion: FlowAdapt通过解决多智能体设置中的帧间冗余和语义退化问题，为V2X协同感知提供了一种参数高效的领域自适应解决方案，在保持高性能的同时显著减少了训练参数。

Abstract: Fast domain adaptation remains a fundamental challenge for deploying multi-agent systems across diverse environments in Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) collaborative perception. Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-aided vision-based Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has emerged as an effective approach for monitoring and assessing structural condition by analyzing image and video data. By integrating Computer Vision (CV) and Deep Learning (DL), vision-based SHM can automatically identify and localize visual patterns associated with structural damage. However, previous works typically generate only discrete outputs, such as damage class labels and damage region coordinates, requiring engineers to further reorganize and analyze these results for evaluation and decision-making. In late 2022, Large Language Models (LLMs) became popular across multiple fields, providing new insights into AI-aided vision-based SHM. In this study, a novel LLM-based Disaster Reconnaissance Summarization (LLM-DRS) framework is proposed. It introduces a standard reconnaissance plan in which the collection of vision data and corresponding metadata follows a well-designed on-site investigation process. Text-based metadata and image-based vision data are then processed and integrated into a unified format, where well-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Networks extract key attributes, including damage state, material type, and damage level. Finally, all data are fed into an LLM with carefully designed prompts, enabling the LLM-DRS to generate summary reports for individual structures or affected regions based on aggregated attributes and metadata. Results show that integrating LLMs into vision-based SHM, particularly for rapid post-disaster reconnaissance, demonstrates promising potential for improving resilience of the built environment through effective reconnaissance.

Conclusion: PLOT-CT通过预对数域的Voronoi分解有效解决了低剂量CT重建中的噪声放大和信息损失问题，显著提升了重建精度，为低剂量CT重建提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reconstruction is fundamentally challenged by severe noise and compromised data fidelity under reduced radiation exposure. Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain.

TL;DR: PLESS是一种通用的伪标签增强策略，通过分层分区和空间一致性改进弱监督分割中的伪标签质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 涂鸦标注降低了密集像素标注的成本，但存在噪声和不完整监督的问题。现有基于伪标签的方法受限于伪标签质量，需要提高其可靠性和空间一致性。

Method: PLESS通过分层分区将图像划分为空间连贯的区域层次结构，在语义连贯区域内传播涂鸦信息来细化伪标签。该框架与模型无关，可轻松集成到现有伪标签方法中。

Result: 在两个公共心脏MRI数据集（ACDC和MSCMRseg）上，对四种涂鸦监督算法进行实验，均显示分割准确性的持续改进。

Conclusion: PLESS是一种有效的伪标签增强策略，能提高弱监督分割的准确性，具有通用性和易集成性，代码将在GitHub上开源。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.

Motivation: 大规模视觉指令调优计算成本高且数据冗余，现有数据选择方法要么需要昂贵训练/梯度计算，要么依赖代理模型或二次复杂度，缺乏可扩展性。

Method: 提取目标VLM中指令token最关注的视觉特征构建样本表示，然后识别最能近似完整数据集表示主导子空间的样本，实现无需成对比较的可扩展重要性评分。

Conclusion: ScalSelect提供了一种高效、可扩展的无训练多模态数据选择方案，显著提升视觉指令调优的训练效率。

Abstract: Large-scale Visual Instruction Tuning (VIT) has become a key paradigm for advancing the performance of vision-language models (VLMs) across various multimodal tasks. However, training on the large-scale datasets is computationally expensive and inefficient due to redundancy in the data, which motivates the need for multimodal data selection to improve training efficiency. Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Motivation: 现有的隐式形状表示方法（如SDFs）通常利用Eikonal偏微分方程，但本文提出使用泊松方程作为代理PDE，探索其与物理现象（如静电势）的关联，以获得更好的表面重建效果。

Method: 将表面重建编码为泊松方程的解，利用格林函数获得闭式参数表达式，利用泊松方程的线性特性通过解叠加来构建目标形状的隐式场。

Result: 该方法在近似高频细节方面表现出改进效果，即使使用少量形状先验也能获得良好结果。

Conclusion: 基于泊松方程的代理PDE方法为表面重建提供了新思路，通过物理类比和线性叠加机制实现了对复杂形状细节的精确重建。

Abstract: Implicit shape representation, such as SDFs, is a popular approach to recover the surface of a 3D shape as the level sets of a scalar field. Several methods approximate SDFs using machine learning strategies that exploit the knowledge that SDFs are solutions of the Eikonal partial differential equation (PDEs). In this work, we present a novel approach to surface reconstruction by encoding it as a solution to a proxy PDE, namely Poisson's equation. Then, we explore the connection between Poisson's equation and physics, e.g., the electrostatic potential due to a positive charge density. We employ Green's functions to obtain a closed-form parametric expression for the PDE's solution, and leverage the linearity of our proxy PDE to find the target shape's implicit field as a superposition of solutions. Our method shows improved results in approximating high-frequency details, even with a small number of shape priors.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了基于ResNet的脑肿瘤分类模型对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，发现BrainNeXt模型在黑盒攻击下最鲁棒，而数据缩减会显著降低模型韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤MRI分类模型的对抗鲁棒性研究不足，但对临床部署至关重要。需要评估不同ResNet变体模型在面对梯度攻击时的脆弱性和韧性。

Method: 使用三种基于ResNet的架构（BrainNet、BrainNeXt、DilationNet），在三种预处理配置（全尺寸增强、缩减增强、缩减非增强MRI数据集）下，评估它们对FGSM和PGD梯度攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: BrainNeXt模型对黑盒攻击最鲁棒（归因于其增加的基数），但产生的可转移对抗样本较弱。BrainNet和Dilation模型相互之间更容易受到攻击，特别是在高迭代步数和α值的PGD攻击下。缩减和非增强数据显著降低模型韧性，即使未篡改的测试准确率仍保持较高。

Conclusion: 脑MRI分析中，分类性能和对抗鲁棒性需要联合评估以确保可靠的现实世界部署。输入分辨率和对抗脆弱性之间存在关键权衡，数据缩减会显著影响模型韧性。

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in deep learning models for brain tumor classification remains an underexplored yet critical challenge, particularly for clinical deployment scenarios involving MRI data. In this work, we investigate the susceptibility and resilience of several ResNet-based architectures, referred to as BrainNet, BrainNeXt and DilationNet, against gradient-based adversarial attacks, namely FGSM and PGD. These models, based on ResNet, ResNeXt, and dilated ResNet variants respectively, are evaluated across three preprocessing configurations (i) full-sized augmented, (ii) shrunk augmented and (iii) shrunk non-augmented MRI datasets. Our experiments reveal that BrainNeXt models exhibit the highest robustness to black-box attacks, likely due to their increased cardinality, though they produce weaker transferable adversarial samples. In contrast, BrainNet and Dilation models are more vulnerable to attacks from each other, especially under PGD with higher iteration steps and $α$ values. Notably, shrunk and non-augmented data significantly reduce model resilience, even when the untampered test accuracy remains high, highlighting a key trade-off between input resolution and adversarial vulnerability. These results underscore the importance of jointly evaluating classification performance and adversarial robustness for reliable real-world deployment in brain MRI analysis.

Conclusion: GR-Diffusion成功整合了GR的几何先验和扩散模型的生成能力，为3D低剂量全身PET重建提供了有效的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) reconstruction is a critical challenge in molecular imaging, often hampered by noise amplification, structural blurring, and detail loss due to sparse sampling and the ill-posed nature of inverse problems. The three-dimensional discrete Gaussian representation (GR), which efficiently encodes 3D scenes using parameterized discrete Gaussian distributions, has shown promise in computer vision. In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information. Experimental results on the UDPET and Clinical datasets with varying dose levels show that GR-Diffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in enhancing 3D whole-body PET image quality and preserving physiological details.

Conclusion: SToRM是首个用于多模态大语言模型的监督式token缩减框架，能够在保持端到端驾驶性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为资源受限的自动驾驶系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end (E2E) driving systems that predict control commands directly from sensor data have achieved significant advancements. For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.
  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss. Experiments on the LangAuto benchmark show that SToRM outperforms state-of-the-art E2E driving MLLMs under the same reduced-token budget, maintaining all-token performance while reducing computational cost by up to 30x.

Abstract: Emotion is important for creating compelling virtual reality (VR) content. Although some generative methods have been applied to lower the barrier to creating emotionally rich content, they fail to capture the nuanced emotional semantics and the fine-grained control essential for immersive experiences. To address these limitations, we introduce EmoSpace, a novel framework for emotion-aware content generation that learns dynamic, interpretable emotion prototypes through vision-language alignment. We employ a hierarchical emotion representation with rich learnable prototypes that evolve during training, enabling fine-grained emotional control without requiring explicit emotion labels. We develop a controllable generation pipeline featuring multi-prototype guidance, temporal blending, and attention reweighting that supports diverse applications, including emotional image outpainting, stylized generation, and emotional panorama generation for VR environments. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of EmoSpace over existing methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Additionally, we present a comprehensive user study investigating how VR environments affect emotional perception compared to desktop settings. Our work facilitates immersive visual content generation with fine-grained emotion control and supports applications like therapy, education, storytelling, artistic creation, and cultural preservation. Code and models will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: Clutt3R-Seg通过层次化实例树和语义线索实现了鲁棒的3D实例分割，在杂乱和稀疏视角场景中表现出色，支持高效的语言引导机器人操作。

Abstract: Reliable 3D instance segmentation is fundamental to language-grounded robotic manipulation. Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cluttered and sparse-view scenarios. Even on the most challenging heavy-clutter sequences, Clutt3R-Seg achieves an AP@25 of 61.66, over 2.2x higher than baselines, and with only four input views it surpasses MaskClustering with eight views by more than 2x.

Conclusion: 颈戴视角视线估计是一个有前景的新研究方向，视线越界分类是有效的改进方法，但多视角协同学习需要进一步优化。该工作为未来颈戴视角研究奠定了基础

Abstract: This paper introduces neck-mounted view gaze estimation, a new task that estimates user gaze from the neck-mounted camera perspective. Prior work on egocentric gaze estimation, which predicts device wearer's gaze location within the camera's field of view, mainly focuses on head-mounted cameras while alternative viewpoints remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains. We further analyze these results and discuss implications for neck-mounted gaze estimation.

Abstract: We developed a lightweight and computationally efficient tool for next-day wildfire spread prediction using multimodal satellite data as input. The deep learning model, which we call Transform Domain Fusion UNet (TD-FusionUNet), incorporates trainable Hadamard Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform layers that apply two-dimensional transforms, enabling the network to capture essential "frequency" components in orthogonalized latent spaces. Additionally, we introduce custom preprocessing techniques, including random margin cropping and a Gaussian mixture model, to enrich the representation of the sparse pre-fire masks and enhance the model's generalization capability. The TD-FusionUNet is evaluated on two datasets which are the Next-Day Wildfire Spread dataset released by Google Research in 2023, and WildfireSpreadTS dataset. Our proposed TD-FusionUNet achieves an F1 score of 0.591 with 370k parameters, outperforming the UNet baseline using ResNet18 as the encoder reported in the WildfireSpreadTS dataset while using substantially fewer parameters. These results show that the proposed latent space fusion model balances accuracy and efficiency under a lightweight setting, making it suitable for real time wildfire prediction applications in resource limited environments.

Abstract: 3D assets have rapidly expanded in quantity and diversity due to the growing popularity of virtual reality and gaming. As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations. Our code will be made available at https://github.com/ndkhanh360/RI-Mamba.git.

Conclusion: 语义控制LDM能生成适合下游算法开发、研究和训练的逼真合成DSA图像。

Abstract: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) plays a central role in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular disease, yet its invasive nature and high acquisition cost severely limit large-scale data collection and public data sharing. Therefore, we developed a semantically conditioned latent diffusion model (LDM) that synthesizes arterial-phase cerebral DSA frames under explicit control of anatomical circulation (anterior vs.\ posterior) and canonical C-arm positions. We curated a large single-centre DSA dataset of 99,349 frames and trained a conditional LDM using text embeddings that encoded anatomy and acquisition geometry. To assess clinical realism, four medical experts, including two neuroradiologists, one neurosurgeon, and one internal medicine expert, systematically rated 400 synthetic DSA images using a 5-grade Likert scale for evaluating proximal large, medium, and small peripheral vessels. The generated images achieved image-wise overall Likert scores ranging from 3.1 to 3.3, with high inter-rater reliability (ICC(2,k) = 0.80--0.87). Distributional similarity to real DSA frames was supported by a low median Fréchet inception distance (FID) of 15.27. Our results indicate that semantically controlled LDMs can produce realistic synthetic DSAs suitable for downstream algorithm development, research, and training.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has revolutionized 3D scene representation with superior efficiency and quality. While recent adaptations for computed tomography (CT) show promise, they struggle with severe artifacts under highly sparse-view projections and dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose Tomographic Geometry Field (TG-Field), a geometry-aware Gaussian deformation framework tailored for both static and dynamic CT reconstruction. A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence. In addition, a motion-flow network models fine-grained respiratory motion to track local anatomical deformations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TG-Field consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy under highly sparse-view conditions.

Abstract: Procedural generation techniques in 3D rendering engines have revolutionized the creation of complex environments, reducing reliance on manual design. Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision. Future work will explore expanding the asset hierarchy, incorporating real-time generation, and adapting the pipeline to other simulation domains beyond agriculture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSO-SLAM：基于高斯场景表示的实时单目稠密SLAM系统，通过双向耦合视觉里程计与高斯泼溅，在EM框架下联合优化，实现实时重建与高精度跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么将跟踪与建图耦合在统一场景中导致计算成本高，要么松散集成到结构化跟踪框架中引入冗余。需要一种既能实时运行又能保持高精度的方法。

Method: 1. 双向耦合视觉里程计与高斯泼溅；2. 在期望最大化框架下进行联合优化，同时细化VO的半稠密深度估计和高斯表示；3. 提出高斯泼溅初始化，利用VO的图像信息、关键帧位姿和像素关联生成接近最终的高斯场景。

Conclusion: GSO-SLAM通过创新的双向耦合和联合优化框架，在实时单目稠密SLAM中实现了高精度的场景重建和跟踪，避免了现有方法的计算冗余和启发式初始化问题。

Abstract: We propose GSO-SLAM, a real-time monocular dense SLAM system that leverages Gaussian scene representation. Unlike existing methods that couple tracking and mapping with a unified scene, incurring computational costs, or loosely integrate them with well-structured tracking frameworks, introducing redundancies, our method bidirectionally couples Visual Odometry (VO) and Gaussian Splatting (GS). Specifically, our approach formulates joint optimization within an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework, enabling the simultaneous refinement of VO-derived semi-dense depth estimates and the GS representation without additional computational overhead. Moreover, we present Gaussian Splat Initialization, which utilizes image information, keyframe poses, and pixel associations from VO to produce close approximations to the final Gaussian scene, thereby eliminating the need for heuristic methods. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our method, showing that it not only operates in real time but also achieves state-of-the-art geometric/photometric fidelity of the reconstructed scene and tracking accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出STVG-R1框架，通过视觉提示范式将坐标预测转为实例级识别问题，结合强化学习优化时空精度，在多个基准上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在密集预测任务（如时空视频定位）中常出现文本描述与视觉坐标不对齐的幻觉问题。现有方法通常需要额外训练模块，导致标注成本和计算开销大。

Method: 1. 提出视觉提示范式：将逐帧坐标预测转为紧凑的实例级识别问题，为每个对象分配唯一、时间一致的ID，并作为视觉提示嵌入视频；2. 引入STVG-R1强化学习框架：使用任务驱动奖励联合优化时间精度、空间一致性和结构格式正则化。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优异：STVG-R1在HCSTVG-v2基准上比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B提升20.9% m_IoU，达到SOTA；在MeViS多目标参考视频对象分割任务上实现零样本泛化，取得47.3% J&F的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 提出的视觉提示范式有效避免了跨模态坐标对齐难题，STVG-R1框架通过强化学习联合优化多个目标，在时空视频定位任务中实现了显著性能提升和良好的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: In vision-language models (VLMs), misalignment between textual descriptions and visual coordinates often induces hallucinations. This issue becomes particularly severe in dense prediction tasks such as spatial-temporal video grounding (STVG). Prior approaches typically focus on enhancing visual-textual alignment or attaching auxiliary decoders. However, these strategies inevitably introduce additional trainable modules, leading to significant annotation costs and computational overhead. In this work, we propose a novel visual prompting paradigm that avoids the difficult problem of aligning coordinates across modalities. Specifically, we reformulate per-frame coordinate prediction as a compact instance-level identification problem by assigning each object a unique, temporally consistent ID. These IDs are embedded into the video as visual prompts, providing explicit and interpretable inputs to the VLMs. Furthermore, we introduce STVG-R1, the first reinforcement learning framework for STVG, which employs a task-driven reward to jointly optimize temporal accuracy, spatial consistency, and structural format regularization. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. STVG-R1 surpasses the baseline Qwen2.5-VL-7B by a remarkable margin of 20.9% on m_IoU on the HCSTVG-v2 benchmark, establishing a new state of the art (SOTA). Surprisingly, STVG-R1 also exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to multi-object referring video object segmentation tasks, achieving a SOTA 47.3% J&F on MeViS.

Motivation: 电子商务产品理解需要强大的多模态理解能力（文本、图像、结构化属性）。通用视觉语言模型虽然能进行通用化的多模态潜在建模，但缺乏针对电商数据特性（属性中心、多图像、噪声）的适配策略，且现有方法往往以牺牲通用性能为代价。

Abstract: E-commerce product understanding demands by nature, strong multimodal comprehension from text, images, and structured attributes. General-purpose Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable generalizable multimodal latent modelling, yet there is no documented, well-known strategy for adapting them to the attribute-centric, multi-image, and noisy nature of e-commerce data, without sacrificing general performance. In this work, we show through a large-scale experimental study, how targeted adaptation of general VLMs can substantially improve e-commerce performance while preserving broad multimodal capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel extensive evaluation suite covering deep product understanding, strict instruction following, and dynamic attribute extraction.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，现有视觉对比解码方法需要改进以更有效地减少幻觉

Method: 利用自监督视觉变换器中的物体中心注意力，移除最显著视觉证据构建辅助视图，破坏无支持的token并产生更强的对比信号

Result: 在两个流行的物体幻觉基准测试和两个MLLM上均表现出一致的性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法提示无关、模型无关，可无缝集成到现有VCD流程中，计算开销小（仅需单次可缓存的向前传播）

Abstract: We study object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and improve visual contrastive decoding (VCD) by constructing an object-aligned auxiliary view. We leverage object-centric attention in self-supervised Vision Transformers. In particular, we remove the most salient visual evidence to construct an auxiliary view that disrupts unsupported tokens and produces a stronger contrast signal. Our method is prompt-agnostic, model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly plugged into the existing VCD pipeline with little computation overhead, i.e., a single cacheable forward pass. Empirically, our method demonstrates consistent gains on two popular object hallucination benchmarks across two MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADTE方法，使用自适应去偏Tsallis熵替代传统Shannon熵，解决CLIP模型在测试时适应中的偏差问题，提升跨域性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法使用Shannon熵衡量预测不确定性，但CLIP模型在预训练时使用了高度不平衡的网络爬取数据，存在内置偏差，导致Shannon熵产生有偏的不确定性估计。

Method: 提出自适应去偏Tsallis熵方法：1) 发现Tsallis熵作为Shannon熵的广义形式，通过非广延参数q更适合描述有偏分布；2) 将TE推广为ADTE，为每个类别定制类特定参数q^l，通过归一化连续测试实例的估计标签偏差得到；3) 自适应选择高置信度视图，结合标签调整策略增强适应，无需分布特定的超参数调优。

Result: ADTE在ImageNet及其五个变体上优于最先进方法，在10个跨域基准测试中达到最高平均性能，且不受模型架构或文本提示影响。

Conclusion: ADTE通过自适应去偏Tsallis熵有效解决CLIP模型的偏差问题，为测试时适应提供了直接且先进的Shannon熵替代方案，显著提升跨域适应性能。

Abstract: Mainstream Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods for adapting vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, typically rely on Shannon Entropy (SE) at test time to measure prediction uncertainty and inconsistency. However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used. Our code is available at https://github.com/Jinx630/ADTE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在4D动态生成中存在两个核心挑战：1）多尺度上下文纠缠——单一生成无法平衡局部物体结构与全局环境布局；2）语义-物理执行差距——开环代码生成导致物理幻觉，缺乏动态保真度

Method: 提出双流架构：检索增强的物体生成与分层环境编排解耦；建立物理感知的闭环机制：PostProcess Agent编写动力学代码，VLM-Motion Critic进行自我反思迭代优化仿真代码

Result: 在Code4D基准测试中，Code2Worlds优于基线方法，获得41%的SGS增益和49%更高的丰富度，能够生成先前静态方法所缺乏的物理感知动态

Conclusion: Code2Worlds通过将4D生成重新定义为语言到仿真代码生成，实现了物理感知的动态世界生成，为构建基于物理定律的世界模拟器提供了新途径

Abstract: Achieving spatial intelligence requires moving beyond visual plausibility to build world simulators grounded in physical laws. While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Motivation: 基于扩散模型的图像和视频重光照技术已有进展，但扩展到4D重光照仍面临挑战：缺乏配对的4D重光照训练数据，以及在极端视角变化下难以保持时间一致性。

Method: 提出两个关键技术：1) 解耦流引导：时间感知策略，在潜在空间中注入光照控制同时保持几何完整性；2) 时间一致性注意力：在IC-Light架构中开发时间一致性注意力机制，并加入确定性正则化消除外观闪烁。

Conclusion: Light4D是一个无需训练的4D重光照框架，通过解耦流引导和时间一致性注意力机制，成功解决了4D重光照中的时间一致性和极端视角变化问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have established a new paradigm for image and video relighting. However, extending these capabilities to 4D relighting remains challenging, due primarily to the scarcity of paired 4D relighting training data and the difficulty of maintaining temporal consistency across extreme viewpoints. In this work, we propose Light4D, a novel training-free framework designed to synthesize consistent 4D videos under target illumination, even under extreme viewpoint changes. First, we introduce Disentangled Flow Guidance, a time-aware strategy that effectively injects lighting control into the latent space while preserving geometric integrity. Second, to reinforce temporal consistency, we develop Temporal Consistent Attention within the IC-Light architecture and further incorporate deterministic regularization to eliminate appearance flickering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in temporal consistency and lighting fidelity, robustly handling camera rotations from -90 to 90.

Method: 提出轻量级RGB-D融合框架：1）使用预训练深度估计器生成深度图；2）通过专用深度编码器将深度特征与RGB特征在中层融合；3）基于EfficientViT-SAM架构增强

Result: 仅用11.2k样本（不到SA-1B的0.1%）训练，达到比EfficientViT-SAM更高的精度，证明深度线索为分割提供强几何先验

Conclusion: 深度信息可作为有效的几何先验，显著减少分割模型对大规模训练数据的依赖，在少量数据下实现更好的性能

Abstract: Segment Anything Models (SAM) achieve impressive universal segmentation performance but require massive datasets (e.g., 11M images) and rely solely on RGB inputs. Recent efficient variants reduce computation but still depend on large-scale training. We propose a lightweight RGB-D fusion framework that augments EfficientViT-SAM with monocular depth priors. Depth maps are generated with a pretrained estimator and fused mid-level with RGB features through a dedicated depth encoder. Trained on only 11.2k samples (less than 0.1\% of SA-1B), our method achieves higher accuracy than EfficientViT-SAM, showing that depth cues provide strong geometric priors for segmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are being recognized in the deep learning realm as a valuable alternative to exhaustively labeled real data. One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.

Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作模型存在样本效率低和泛化能力有限的问题，研究发现这与预训练视觉表示在环境理解和策略先验方面的不足密切相关。现有视觉表示（无论是语言-图像对比学习还是图像自监督学习）无法充分捕捉任务相关的环境信息和有效的策略先验知识。

Method: 提出JEPA-VLA方法，自适应地将预测性嵌入（特别是V-JEPA 2）集成到现有VLA模型中。V-JEPA 2通过视频预训练能够灵活丢弃不可预测的环境因素，编码任务相关的时间动态信息，从而弥补现有视觉表示的关键缺陷。

Conclusion: 预测性视频嵌入是增强视觉-语言-动作模型的关键组件，能够有效提升环境理解和策略先验能力。JEPA-VLA通过简单而有效的方式集成这些嵌入，为VLA模型的改进提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models built upon pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved significant improvements in robotic manipulation. However, current VLAs still suffer from low sample efficiency and limited generalization. This paper argues that these limitations are closely tied to an overlooked component, pretrained visual representation, which offers insufficient knowledge on both aspects of environment understanding and policy prior. Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs. Our experiments demonstrate that JEPA-VLA yields substantial performance gains across a range of benchmarks, including LIBERO, LIBERO-plus, RoboTwin2.0, and real-robot tasks.

Abstract: Dynamic reconstruction has achieved remarkable progress, but there remain challenges in monocular input for more practical applications. The prevailing works attempt to construct efficient motion representations, but lack a unified spatiotemporal decomposition framework, suffering from either holistic temporal optimization or coupled hierarchical spatial composition. To this end, we propose WorldTree, a unified framework comprising Temporal Partition Tree (TPT) that enables coarse-to-fine optimization based on the inheritance-based partition tree structure for hierarchical temporal decomposition, and Spatial Ancestral Chains (SAC) that recursively query ancestral hierarchical structure to provide complementary spatial dynamics while specializing motion representations across ancestral nodes. Experimental results on different datasets indicate that our proposed method achieves 8.26% improvement of LPIPS on NVIDIA-LS and 9.09% improvement of mLPIPS on DyCheck compared to the second-best method.

Conclusion: PMI方法有效解决了Rectified-Flow模型逆过程的稳定性问题，提高了重建和编辑质量，具有理论严谨性和高效性

Abstract: Rectified-Flow (RF)-based generative models have recently emerged as strong alternatives to traditional diffusion models, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across various tasks. By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian. Furthermore, we introduce mimic-CFG, a lightweight velocity correction scheme for editing tasks, which interpolates between the current velocity and its projection onto the historical average, balancing editing effectiveness and structural consistency. Extensive experiments on PIE-Bench demonstrate that our methods significantly improve inversion stability, image reconstruction quality, and editing fidelity, while reducing the required number of neural function evaluations. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PIE-Bench with enhanced efficiency and theoretical soundness.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知方面表现不佳，现有"Thinking-with-Images"方法通过迭代缩放区域来改善，但带来高延迟问题。

Method: 提出区域到图像蒸馏：先对微裁剪区域进行缩放，让强教师模型生成高质量VQA数据，然后将这种区域基础监督蒸馏回完整图像，训练学生模型实现单次前向传播的细粒度感知。

Result: 模型在多个细粒度感知基准测试中取得领先性能，同时提升视觉推理和GUI代理等一般多模态认知能力，并提出了ZoomBench基准测试。

Conclusion: 将缩放操作从推理时工具转化为训练时原语，能够在不增加推理延迟的情况下提升MLLM的细粒度感知能力，并探讨了何时需要"Thinking-with-Images"方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but still struggle with fine-grained perception, where decisive evidence is small and easily overwhelmed by global context. Recent "Thinking-with-Images" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves "single-glance" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional "zooming gap". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when "Thinking-with-Images" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

*Ji Li,Zhiwei Li,Shihao Li,Zhenjiang Yu,Boyang Wang,Haiou Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffPlace是一个新颖的框架，通过引入place-ID控制器实现地点可控的多视角图像生成，解决了现有方法在生成地点感知和背景一致的城市场景方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多视角扩散模型在从文本、BEV地图和物体边界框生成地点感知和背景一致的城市场景方面存在困难，这限制了它们在为地点识别任务生成真实样本方面的有效性。

Method: 提出DiffPlace框架，引入place-ID控制器，使用线性投影、感知器变换器和对比学习将place-ID嵌入映射到固定的CLIP空间，从而在保持背景建筑一致性的同时灵活修改前景物体和天气条件。

Result: 广泛的实验（包括定量比较和增强训练评估）表明，DiffPlace在生成质量和视觉地点识别训练支持方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiffPlace展示了生成模型在增强场景级和地点感知合成方面的潜力，为改进自动驾驶中的地点识别提供了有价值的方法。

Abstract: Generative models have advanced significantly in realistic image synthesis, with diffusion models excelling in quality and stability. Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving

*Hongxu Yang,Levente Lippenszky,Edina Timko,Gopal Avinash*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于展开网络的环形伪影减少方法，利用CT几何的正向投影和合成数据进行训练，无需真实临床数据即可有效校正伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT探测器的不一致响应会导致重建图像中出现环形和条纹伪影，影响临床使用。现有深度学习方法需要专门的训练数据集，成本高昂，且仅关注图像域或投影域，忽略了CT几何的内在关联。

Method: 将环形伪影问题重新表述为逆问题，使用展开网络同时考虑非理想探测器响应和CT几何的线性正向投影。利用自然图像生成的合成数据，挖掘投影域和图像域之间的内在相关性，使模型无需真实临床数据即可训练。

Result: 在不同扫描几何和人体区域的广泛评估表明，基于合成数据训练的模型在环形伪影减少方面始终优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合CT几何的正向操作和合成数据训练，实现了无需真实临床数据的有效环形伪影校正，为CT图像质量提升提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Defective and inconsistent responses in CT detectors can cause ring and streak artifacts in the reconstructed images, making them unusable for clinical purposes. In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出结合隐式神经表示和去噪扩散模型的新框架，合成LGE图像及分割掩码，缓解数据稀缺问题，提升纤维化分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LGE成像是心肌瘢痕评估的临床标准，但标注数据有限阻碍了自动分割方法的发展，需要解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 首先训练INR捕获LGE数据和心肌/纤维化掩码的连续空间表示，压缩为潜在嵌入，然后使用扩散模型在潜在空间生成新表示，解码为合成LGE图像和分割掩码

Result: 在133个心脏MRI扫描上的实验表明，用200个合成体积增强训练数据可将纤维化分割Dice分数从0.509提升到0.524

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需标注的解决方案，有助于缓解数据稀缺问题，代码已公开

Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging is the clinical standard for myocardial scar assessment, but limited annotated datasets hinder the development of automated segmentation methods. We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524. Our approach provides an annotation-free method to help mitigate data scarcity.The code for this research is publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型在法语PDF转Markdown任务上的表现，创建了一个法语文档基准测试，发现专有模型在手写体和表单处理上更鲁棒，而开源模型在标准印刷布局上仍有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文档解析是检索增强生成(RAG)管道的关键步骤，转录和布局错误会传播到下游检索和基础任务。现有基准测试通常侧重于英语或中文，并且可能过度惩罚对下游使用无关紧要的格式和线性化选择。

Method: 通过模型分歧采样从60,000个文档语料库中选择困难页面，构建法语基准测试。评估采用单元测试风格的检查，针对具体失败模式（文本存在、阅读顺序和局部表格约束），并结合类别特定的规范化以忽略仅与呈现相关的差异。

Result: 评估了15个模型，发现最强专有模型在手写体和表单处理上具有显著更高的鲁棒性，而多个开源权重系统在标准印刷布局上仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该研究为法语文档解析提供了专门的基准测试方法，揭示了不同模型在处理复杂法语文档时的性能差异，为RAG管道的文档解析步骤提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This report evaluates PDF-to-Markdown conversion using recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on challenging French documents. Document parsing is a critical step for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, where transcription and layout errors propagate to downstream retrieval and grounding. Existing benchmarks often emphasize English or Chinese and can over-penalize benign formatting and linearization choices (e.g., line breaks, list segmentation, alternative table renderings) that are largely irrelevant for downstream use.
  We introduce a French-focused benchmark of difficult pages selected via model-disagreement sampling from a corpus of 60{,}000 documents, covering handwritten forms, complex layouts, dense tables, and graphics-rich pages. Evaluation is performed with unit-test-style checks that target concrete failure modes (text presence, reading order, and local table constraints) combined with category-specific normalization designed to discount presentation-only variance. Across 15 models, we observe substantially higher robustness for the strongest proprietary models on handwriting and forms, while several open-weights systems remain competitive on standard printed layouts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个基于贝叶斯深度学习的概率优化框架，通过新的置信度-不确定性边界损失（CUB-Loss）和双温度缩放（DTS）策略，解决医学影像AI模型的校准问题，使不确定性估计与预测正确性对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于医学影像的关键决策支持系统中，AI辅助决策的可靠性与预测准确性同等重要。尽管深度学习模型已展现出显著的准确性，但它们经常存在校准不足的问题，表现为对错误预测的过度自信。为了促进临床接受度，模型需要以与预测正确性相关的方式量化不确定性，使临床医生能够识别不可靠的输出进行进一步审查。

Method: 提出了一个通用的概率优化框架，基于贝叶斯深度学习。具体包括：1）新的置信度-不确定性边界损失（CUB-Loss），对高置信度的错误预测和低置信度的正确预测施加惩罚，明确强制预测正确性与不确定性估计的对齐；2）双温度缩放（DTS）策略用于后处理校准，进一步细化后验分布以提高直观可解释性。

Result: 在三个不同的医学影像任务上验证了该框架：肺炎自动筛查、糖尿病视网膜病变检测和皮肤病变识别。实证结果表明，所提出的方法在不同模态下实现了一致的校准改进，在数据稀缺场景下保持了稳健性能，并且在严重不平衡的数据集上仍然有效。

Conclusion: 该框架通过强制不确定性估计与预测正确性对齐，解决了医学影像AI模型的校准问题，展示了其在真实临床部署中的潜力，特别是在数据稀缺和不平衡数据集等具有挑战性的场景下。

Abstract: In critical decision support systems based on medical imaging, the reliability of AI-assisted decision-making is as relevant as predictive accuracy. Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.

Motivation: 扩散模型在美学图像合成方面表现出色，但在复杂空间理解和推理方面存在困难。现有方法要么计算成本高，要么空间信息损失严重

Method: 1) 使用文本-坐标交错指令格式训练扩散模型增强布局感知；2) 利用先进MLLM作为规划器生成全面布局计划，将其空间规划能力直接转移到生成过程

Conclusion: SCoT框架是即插即用方法，有效桥接MLLM的推理能力和扩散模型的生成能力，解决了复杂空间理解问题

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in aesthetic image synthesis, they often struggle with complex spatial understanding and reasoning. Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.

Conclusion: 生成式AI方法特别是经过LoRA微调的视觉语言模型，在新生儿复苏视频活动识别任务中表现出色，能够有效提升细粒度活动识别的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate documentation of newborn resuscitation is essential for quality improvement and adherence to clinical guidelines, yet remains underutilized in practice. Previous work using 3D-CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViT) has shown promising results in detecting key activities from newborn resuscitation videos, but also highlighted the challenges in recognizing such fine-grained activities. This work investigates the potential of generative AI (GenAI) methods to improve activity recognition from such videos. Specifically, we explore the use of local vision-language models (VLMs), combined with large language models (LLMs), and compare them to a supervised TimeSFormer baseline. Using a simulated dataset comprising 13.26 hours of newborn resuscitation videos, we evaluate several zero-shot VLM-based strategies and fine-tuned VLMs with classification heads, including Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our results suggest that small (local) VLMs struggle with hallucinations, but when fine-tuned with LoRA, the results reach F1 score at 0.91, surpassing the TimeSformer results of 0.70.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for diffusion-based novel view synthesis in which we leverage external representations as conditions, harnessing their geometric and semantic correspondence properties for enhanced geometric consistency in generated novel viewpoints. First, we provide a detailed analysis exploring the correspondence capabilities emergent in the spatial attention of external visual representations. Building from these insights, we propose a representation-guided novel view synthesis through dedicated representation projection modules that inject external representations into the diffusion process, a methodology named ReNoV, short for representation-guided novel view synthesis. Our experiments show that this design yields marked improvements in both reconstruction fidelity and inpainting quality, outperforming prior diffusion-based novel-view methods on standard benchmarks and enabling robust synthesis from sparse, unposed image collections.

Abstract: Background The accuracy of photomechanics measurements critically relies on image quality,particularly under extreme illumination conditions such as welding arc monitoring and polished metallic surface analysis. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging above 120 dB is essential in these contexts. Conventional CCD/CMOS sensors, with dynamic ranges typically below 70 dB, are highly susceptible to saturation under glare, resulting in irreversible loss of detail and significant errors in digital image correlation (DIC). Methods This paper presents an HDR imaging system that leverages the spatial modulation capability of a digital micromirror device (DMD). The system architecture enables autonomous regional segmentation and adaptive exposure control for high-dynamic-range scenes through an integrated framework comprising two synergistic subsystems: a DMD-based optical modulation unit and an adaptive computational imaging pipeline. Results The system achieves a measurable dynamic range of 127 dB, effectively eliminating satu ration artifacts under high glare. Experimental results demonstrate a 78% reduction in strain error and improved DIC positioning accuracy, confirming reliable performance across extreme intensity variations. Conclusion The DMD-based system provides high fidelity adaptive HDR imaging, overcoming key limitations of conventional sensors. It exhibits strong potential for optical metrology and stress analysis in high-glare environments where traditional methods are inadequate.

TL;DR: PosterOmni是一个统一的图像到海报生成框架，通过数据蒸馏奖励管道整合局部编辑和全局创作，在多个任务上超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像到海报生成需要同时处理局部调整（保持视觉实体）和全局设计（理解抽象概念），现有方法难以统一处理这两个相互关联的需求。

Method: 提出PosterOmni框架，包含三个核心组件：1）构建涵盖六种任务类型的多场景数据集；2）通过知识蒸馏在局部和全局专家间进行监督微调；3）应用统一的奖励反馈机制联合对齐视觉实体保持和美学偏好。

Result: 实验表明PosterOmni在参考一致性、全局构图质量和美学和谐度方面显著提升，超越所有开源基线，甚至超过多个专有系统。

Conclusion: PosterOmni成功统一了局部编辑和全局创作两个范式，为图像到海报生成提供了一个通用框架，并通过基准测试验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Image-to-poster generation is a high-demand task requiring not only local adjustments but also high-level design understanding. Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.

Abstract: Post-training of flow matching models-aligning the output distribution with a high-quality target-is mathematically equivalent to imitation learning. While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization.

TL;DR: DreamID-Omni：统一可控人本音视频生成框架，通过对称条件扩散Transformer和双级解耦策略解决多人物身份-音色绑定问题，在多项任务上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将参考音视频生成、视频编辑和音频驱动视频动画等任务视为孤立目标，且在多人物场景中难以实现精确的身份与音色解耦控制。

Method: 提出对称条件扩散Transformer整合异构条件信号；采用双级解耦策略（信号级的同步RoPE和语义级的结构化描述）；设计多任务渐进训练方案。

Result: 在视频、音频和音视频一致性方面实现全面的SOTA性能，甚至超越领先的专有商业模型。

Conclusion: DreamID-Omni为可控人本音视频生成提供了统一框架，解决了身份-音色绑定失败问题，将开源代码以弥合学术研究与商业应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models have revolutionized joint audio-video generation. However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models. We will release our code to bridge the gap between academic research and commercial-grade applications.

TL;DR: EO-VAE：用于地球观测数据的多传感器变分自编码器，作为EO领域的统一tokenizer，可处理灵活通道组合，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型主要针对RGB数据，而地球观测数据具有传感器多样性和可变光谱通道的独特挑战，需要专门的tokenizer。

Method: 提出EO-VAE多传感器变分自编码器，使用动态超网络实现单一模型编码和重建灵活通道组合，替代为每种模态训练独立tokenizer的方法。

Result: 在TerraMesh数据集上的实验表明，EO-VAE相比TerraMind tokenizers实现了更优的重建保真度，为遥感领域的潜在生成建模建立了稳健基线。

Conclusion: EO-VAE作为地球观测领域的统一tokenizer，能够有效处理多传感器数据的多样性，为后续生成模型提供了更好的基础表示。

Abstract: State-of-the-art generative image and video models rely heavily on tokenizers that compress high-dimensional inputs into more efficient latent representations. While this paradigm has revolutionized RGB generation, Earth observation (EO) data presents unique challenges due to diverse sensor specifications and variable spectral channels. We propose EO-VAE, a multi-sensor variational autoencoder designed to serve as a foundational tokenizer for the EO domain. Unlike prior approaches that train separate tokenizers for each modality, EO-VAE utilizes a single model to encode and reconstruct flexible channel combinations via dynamic hypernetworks. Our experiments on the TerraMesh dataset demonstrate that EO-VAE achieves superior reconstruction fidelity compared to the TerraMind tokenizers, establishing a robust baseline for latent generative modeling in remote sensing.

TL;DR: DeepGen 1.0是一个轻量级5B参数的多模态统一模型，通过创新的SCB深度对齐框架和三阶段训练策略，在图像生成和编辑任务上超越了更大的模型（如80B和27B模型）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型通常参数规模巨大（>10B），导致训练成本高昂且部署困难。需要开发轻量级但性能强大的模型来降低门槛。

Method: 1. 提出Stacked Channel Bridging（SCB）深度对齐框架，从多个VLM层提取层次特征并与可学习的"think tokens"融合，为生成主干提供结构化、富含推理的指导。2. 设计三阶段数据中心训练策略：对齐预训练、联合监督微调、以及使用MR-GRPO的强化学习。

Result: 仅用约5000万样本训练，DeepGen 1.0在多个基准测试中取得领先性能：在WISE上超越80B HunyuanImage 28%，在UniREditBench上超越27B Qwen-Image-Edit 37%。

Conclusion: DeepGen 1.0提供了一个高效、高性能的轻量级统一多模态模型，通过开源代码、权重和数据集，为多模态研究民主化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.

Conclusion: UniDFlow通过解耦理解和生成任务以及基于参考的偏好对齐，实现了高效的多模态理解、生成和编辑，在保持模型轻量化的同时获得了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose UniDFlow, a unified discrete flow-matching framework for multimodal understanding, generation, and editing. It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Monarch-RT，一种用于实时视频生成的稀疏注意力参数化方法，通过Monarch矩阵分解注意力，在保持计算效率的同时实现高表达能力，首次在单RTX 5090上实现16 FPS的真实实时视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频生成中，基于扩散变换器的3D自注意力存在二次计算成本瓶颈。在少步和自回归的实时场景下，现有稀疏注意力近似方法失效，因为视频注意力并非可靠稀疏，而是结合了周期性结构、稀疏语义对应和密集混合。

Method: 提出Monarch-RT，使用Monarch矩阵结构化参数化视频扩散模型的注意力，通过适当对齐的块结构和扩展的平铺Monarch参数化实现高表达能力。通过微调和定制Triton内核克服参数化开销。

Result: Monarch-RT在双向模型上优于现有稀疏基线，应用于最先进的Self-Forcing模型时达到95%注意力稀疏度且无质量损失。优化实现优于FlashAttention-2/3/4内核，在RTX 5090、H100、B200 GPU上获得1.4-11.8倍加速，首次在单RTX 5090上实现16 FPS真实实时视频生成。

Conclusion: Monarch-RT是首个用于实时视频生成的高性能稀疏注意力参数化方法，通过结构化注意力分解解决了实时场景下的计算瓶颈，实现了真正的实时视频生成能力。

Abstract: Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X. This enables us, for the first time, to achieve true real-time video generation with Self-Forcing at 16 FPS on a single RTX 5090.

TL;DR: UniT框架通过多模态思维链测试时扩展，让统一模型能够进行迭代推理、验证和精炼，提升复杂空间组合和多对象交互任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型通常单次处理而不迭代精炼输出，但许多复杂任务（如空间组合、多对象交互、动态指令）需要分解指令、验证中间结果并进行迭代修正。测试时扩展在语言模型中已证明有效，但扩展到多模态统一模型仍是挑战。

Method: 提出UniT框架，结合智能数据合成、统一模型训练和灵活测试时推理，实现多模态思维链测试时扩展。模型通过多轮推理、验证和精炼，展现验证、子目标分解和内容记忆等认知行为。

Result: 1) 在短推理轨迹上训练的统一模型能泛化到更长的测试时推理链；2) 顺序思维链推理比并行采样更具可扩展性和计算效率；3) 在生成和编辑轨迹上训练能改善分布外视觉推理性能。

Conclusion: 多模态测试时扩展是推进统一模型生成和理解能力的有效范式，UniT框架为复杂多模态任务提供了迭代推理和精炼的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and making iterative corrections. While test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated that allocating additional inference compute for iterative reasoning substantially improves language model performance, extending this paradigm to unified multimodal models remains an open challenge. We introduce UniT, a framework for multimodal chain-of-thought test-time scaling that enables a single unified model to reason, verify, and refine across multiple rounds. UniT combines agentic data synthesis, unified model training, and flexible test-time inference to elicit cognitive behaviors including verification, subgoal decomposition, and content memory. Our key findings are: (1) unified models trained on short reasoning trajectories generalize to longer inference chains at test time; (2) sequential chain-of-thought reasoning provides a more scalable and compute-efficient TTS strategy than parallel sampling; (3) training on generation and editing trajectories improves out-of-distribution visual reasoning. These results establish multimodal test-time scaling as an effective paradigm for advancing both generation and understanding in unified models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉错觉主要依赖空间操作（如多视图一致性），本文旨在将视觉字谜从空间维度扩展到时间维度，探索通过笔画序列实现语义转换的新颖任务。

Method: 提出Stroke of Surprise生成框架，采用序列感知联合优化和双分支SDS机制，动态调整前缀笔画以发现"共同结构子空间"，并引入覆盖损失确保空间互补性而非遮挡。

Result: 实验表明该方法在可识别性和错觉强度方面显著优于现有基线，成功实现了从空间到时间维度的视觉字谜扩展。

Conclusion: 提出了渐进式语义错觉这一新任务，通过Stroke of Surprise框架解决了双重约束优化问题，为时间维度上的视觉错觉开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Visual illusions traditionally rely on spatial manipulations such as multi-view consistency. In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the "dual-constraint": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a "common structural subspace" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

Motivation: 现有RAG方法通常假设结构化文本源并在查询时进行检索和生成，这限制了其在真实聊天机器人场景中的应用，特别是处理大量非结构化文档和有限计算资源的情况。

Method: 1) 通过OCR和布局分析处理原始非结构化PDF文档，转换为层次化文本块；2) 使用LLM从组织好的文本块预生成QA知识库；3) 查询时优先匹配QA库中的答案，仅在无合适匹配时回退到实时生成。

Result: 在OHRBench上的实验表明，HybridRAG相比标准RAG基线提供了更高的答案质量和更低的延迟。

Conclusion: HybridRAG是处理大量非结构化文档和有限计算资源的真实聊天机器人应用的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach for grounding Large Language Model (LLM)-based chatbot responses on external knowledge. However, existing RAG studies typically assume well-structured textual sources (e.g. Wikipedia or curated datasets) and perform retrieval and generation at query time, which can limit their applicability in real-world chatbot scenarios. In this paper, we present HybridRAG, a novel and practical RAG framework towards more accurate and faster chatbot responses. First, HybridRAG ingests raw, unstructured PDF documents containing complex layouts (text, tables, figures) via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and layout analysis, and convert them into hierarchical text chunks. Then, it pre-generates a plausible question-answer (QA) knowledge base from the organized chunks using an LLM. At query time, user questions are matched against this QA bank to retrieve immediate answers when possible, and only if no suitable QA match is found does our framework fall back to an on-the-fly response generation. Experiments on OHRBench demonstrate that our HybridRAG provides higher answer quality and lower latency compared to a standard RAG baseline. We believe that HybridRAG could be a practical solution for real-world chatbot applications that must handle large volumes of unstructured documents and lots of users under limited computational resources.

TL;DR: 研究探索知识蒸馏在跨语言安全对齐中的应用，发现使用教师模型的"安全"拒绝数据进行标准微调反而会增加学生模型的越狱成功率，揭示了多语言安全对齐的复杂挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的安全对齐主要集中于英语，导致在非英语特别是低资源语言环境下存在安全漏洞。需要探索有效的跨语言安全对齐方法。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，将专有教师模型（OpenAI o1-mini）的拒绝行为通过LoRA参数高效微调蒸馏到三个开源学生模型中。使用XSafety提供的约28,000个多语言越狱提示进行黑盒响应式训练。

Result: 评估发现反直觉现象：使用教师模型"安全"拒绝数据进行标准微调反而使所有学生模型的越狱成功率上升（最高达16.6个百分点）。通过移除"边界"拒绝这一主要安全降级源，可以缓解安全下降，但推理性能（GSM8K）仍会降低。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏作为多语言安全对齐技术既面临挑战也有潜力，需要进一步研究。不同基础模型在蒸馏过程中对未见语言表现出不同的泛化能力，揭示了多语言安全对齐的复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, yet their safety alignment remains predominantly English-centric. This allows for vulnerabilities in non-English contexts, especially with low-resource languages. We introduce a novel application of knowledge distillation (KD) in the context of multilingual jailbreak prevention, examining its efficacy. We distill the refusal behaviors of a proprietary teacher model (OpenAI o1-mini) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) into three open-source student models: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Gemma-2-2B-IT, and Qwen3-8B, using ~28,000 multilingual jailbreak prompts from XSafety via black-box response-based, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Evaluation on the MultiJail benchmark reveals a counterintuitive behavior: standard fine-tuning on the teacher's ``safe'' refusal data inadvertently increases Jailbreak Success Rate (JSR) for all student models, up to 16.6 percentage points. Our experiments reveal a divergent generalization to unseen languages during distillation, with varying outcomes depending on the base model. By removing a primary source of safety degradation, nuanced `boundary' refusals, we mitigate or even reverse safety declines in student models, although reductions in reasoning performance (GSM8K) persist. Overall, our exploratory study highlights the challenges and potential of KD as a technique for multilingual safety alignment, offering a foundation for future research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有研究主要基于静态统计数据识别LLM中的检索头，忽略了自回归生成过程中的细粒度时序动态性。本文旨在从动态视角深入探究检索头的工作机制。

Method: 通过广泛分析，建立三个核心主张：动态性、不可替代性和相关性。在Needle-in-a-Haystack任务和多跳QA任务上验证发现，并在动态检索增强生成框架中量化动态与静态检索头的效用差异。

Result: 发现检索头在不同时间步动态变化；动态检索头具有时序特异性且无法被静态检索头有效替代；模型隐藏状态编码了预测未来检索头模式的信号，表明存在内部规划机制。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的内部机制提供了新见解，强调从动态视角理解检索头的重要性，揭示了模型在生成过程中的内部规划能力。

Abstract: Recent studies have identified "retrieval heads" in Large Language Models (LLMs) responsible for extracting information from input contexts. However, prior works largely rely on static statistics aggregated across datasets, identifying heads that perform retrieval on average. This perspective overlooks the fine-grained temporal dynamics of autoregressive generation. In this paper, we investigate retrieval heads from a dynamic perspective. Through extensive analysis, we establish three core claims: (1) Dynamism: Retrieval heads vary dynamically across timesteps; (2) Irreplaceability: Dynamic retrieval heads are specific at each timestep and cannot be effectively replaced by static retrieval heads; and (3) Correlation: The model's hidden state encodes a predictive signal for future retrieval head patterns, indicating an internal planning mechanism. We validate these findings on the Needle-in-a-Haystack task and a multi-hop QA task, and quantify the differences on the utility of dynamic and static retrieval heads in a Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework. Our study provides new insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs.

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an important task in natural language processing that aims to identify and extract key entities from unstructured text. We present a novel application of NER in plasma physics research articles and address the challenges of extracting specialized entities from scientific text in this domain. Research articles in plasma physics often contain highly complex and context-rich content that must be extracted to enable, e.g., advanced search. We propose a lightweight approach based on encoder-transformers and conditional random fields to extract (nested) named entities from plasma physics research articles. First, we annotate a plasma physics corpus with 16 classes specifically designed for the nested NER task. Second, we evaluate an entity-specific model specialization approach, where independent BERT-CRF models are trained to recognize individual entity types in plasma physics text. Third, we integrate an optimization process to systematically fine-tune hyperparameters and enhance model performance. Our work contributes to the advancement of entity recognition in plasma physics and also provides a foundation to support researchers in navigating and analyzing scientific literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在开放域问答中广泛应用，但其对近期信息的回答与人类视角的一致性尚未充分研究。需要评估模型在时间敏感信息上的表现，并建立多维度评估框架。

Method: 构建RECOM数据集（15,000个2025年9月的Reddit问题及社区答案），评估4个开源LLMs（Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, GPT-OSS-20B）。使用词汇指标（BLEU, ROUGE）、语义相似度（BERTScore, MoverScore, 余弦相似度）和逻辑推理（NLI）进行多维度评估。

Result: 发现语义-词汇悖论：所有模型与参考答案的余弦相似度超过99%，但BLEU-1重叠度低于8%，差距超过90个百分点。MoverScore（51-53%）处于中间位置。模型规模不预测性能：Mistral-7B（7B参数）在所有指标上优于GPT-OSS-20B（20B参数）。矛盾率低于7%，模型很少生成与人类共识直接冲突的内容。

Conclusion: 词汇指标在评估抽象生成任务中不可靠，需要多维度的评估框架来捕捉超越表面文本匹配的语义保真度。RECOM数据集公开可用，为评估LLMs在近期信息上的对齐性提供了基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for open-domain question answering, yet their alignment with human perspectives on temporally recent information remains underexplored. We introduce RECOM (Reddit Evaluation for Correspondence of Models), a benchmark dataset of 15,000 recent Reddit questions from September 2025 paired with community-derived reference answers. We investigate how four open-source LLMs (Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, Gemma-2-9B, and GPT-OSS-20B) respond to these questions, evaluating alignment using lexical metrics (BLEU, ROUGE), semantic similarity (BERTScore, MoverScore, cosine similarity), and logical inference (NLI). Our central finding is a striking semantic-lexical paradox: all models achieve over 99% cosine similarity with references despite less than 8% BLEU-1 overlap, a 90+ percentage point gap indicating that models preserve meaning through extensive paraphrasing rather than lexical reproduction. MoverScore (51-53%) confirms this pattern, occupying an intermediate position that reflects the optimal transport cost of semantic alignment. Furthermore, model scale does not predict performance: Mistral-7B (7B parameters) outperforms GPT-OSS-20B (20B parameters) across all metrics. NLI analysis reveals that contradiction rates remain below 7%, suggesting models rarely generate content that directly conflicts with human consensus. These findings challenge the reliability of lexical metrics for evaluating abstractive generation and argue for multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks that capture semantic fidelity beyond surface-level text matching.

TL;DR: PEFT方法能显著提升大语言模型的幻觉检测能力，主要通过重塑不确定性编码而非注入新事实知识


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然参数高效微调方法被广泛用于适配大语言模型并假设能改善事实正确性，但其对幻觉行为的影响在QA数据集上仍未被充分理解

Method: 系统研究PEFT对幻觉检测的影响，使用三个开源LLM骨干和三个事实寻求QA基准，通过七种无监督幻觉检测方法（基于语义一致性、置信度和熵）进行多角度评估

Result: PEFT一致性地增强幻觉检测能力，显著提高AUROC指标；进一步分析表明PEFT主要通过重塑不确定性编码方式而非注入新事实知识来发挥作用

Conclusion: PEFT方法能有效提升大语言模型的幻觉检测性能，其作用机制主要是改善模型对不确定性的编码和表达方式

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks and are often assumed to improve factual correctness. However, how the parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods affect hallucination behavior remains insufficiently understood, especially on QA datasets. In this work, we systematically investigate the impact of PEFT on hallucination detection through a comprehensive empirical study across three open-weight LLM backbones and three fact-seeking QA benchmarks. For each model, we evaluate performance using seven unsupervised hallucination detection methods spanning three complementary approaches: semantic consistency based detectors, confidence based detectors, and entropy based detectors. This multifaceted evaluation enables us to characterize how PEFT reshapes uncertainty across different detection paradigms. In conclusion, our experimental results show that PEFT consistently strengthens hallucination detection ability, substantially improving AUROC across a wide range of hallucination detectors. Besides, further analyses using linear probes and representation diagnostics indicate that PEFT methods primarily reshapes how uncertainty is encoded and surfaced, comparing with injecting new factual knowledge into the models.

TL;DR: FalseCite是一个用于系统研究LLM幻觉的数据集，通过误导性引用诱导幻觉，并在多个模型中观察到虚假引用显著增加幻觉，特别是GPT-4o-mini。通过分析隐藏状态向量发现，无论是否幻觉，向量都呈现独特的角状形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常产生幻觉，生成无意义或虚假信息，这在医学、法律等敏感领域尤其有害。需要系统研究这一现象，特别是由误导性引用诱导的幻觉。

Method: 引入FalseCite数据集，专门捕捉和基准测试由误导或伪造引用诱导的幻觉响应。在GPT-4o-mini、Falcon-7B和Mistral 7-B上运行该数据集，分析隐藏状态向量，进行可视化和聚类。

Result: 观察到虚假声明配合欺骗性引用会显著增加幻觉活动，特别是在GPT-4o-mini中。分析隐藏状态向量发现，无论是否幻觉，向量都倾向于追踪出独特的角状形状。

Conclusion: FalseCite有潜力作为未来LLM研究中评估和缓解幻觉的基础工具，为系统研究幻觉现象提供了重要数据集和分析方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often hallucinate, generating nonsensical or false information that can be especially harmful in sensitive fields such as medicine or law. To study this phenomenon systematically, we introduce FalseCite, a curated dataset designed to capture and benchmark hallucinated responses induced by misleading or fabricated citations. Running GPT-4o-mini, Falcon-7B, and Mistral 7-B through FalseCite, we observed a noticeable increase in hallucination activity for false claims with deceptive citations, especially in GPT-4o-mini. Using the responses from FalseCite, we can also analyze the internal states of hallucinating models, visualizing and clustering the hidden state vectors. From this analysis, we noticed that the hidden state vectors, regardless of hallucination or non-hallucination, tend to trace out a distinct horn-like shape. Our work underscores FalseCite's potential as a foundation for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in future LLM research.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用组合融合分析(CFA)结合多个AI模型来增强联合国可持续发展目标(SDG)的文本分类，通过生成式AI创建合成数据训练模型，CFA方法达到96.73%准确率，优于单个最佳模型，并与人类专家结果互补。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在文本分类中，当类别不可用、难以区分或相互关联时，传统NLP技术面临挑战。可持续发展目标(SDG)的社会分析需要准确的文本分类，但现有方法存在局限性。需要结合多个模型的智能来提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 通过CFA结合多个AI模型的智能，并融合人类专家输入，可以有效提升SDG文本分类的性能。这种方法展示了机器智能与人类专业知识协同工作的潜力，为解决复杂文本分类问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: (Natural Language Processing) NLP techniques such as text classification and topic discovery are very useful in many application areas including information retrieval, knowledge discovery, policy formulation, and decision-making. However, it remains a challenging problem in cases where the categories are unavailable, difficult to differentiate, or are interrelated. Social analysis with human context is an area that can benefit from text classification, as it relies substantially on text data. The focus of this paper is to enhance the classification of text according to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by collecting and combining intelligence from multiple models. Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA), a system fusion paradigm using a rank-score characteristic (RSC) function and cognitive diversity (CD), has been used to enhance classifier methods by combining a set of relatively good and mutually diverse classification models. We use a generative AI model to generate synthetic data for model training and then apply CFA to this classification task. The CFA technique achieves 96.73% performance, outperforming the best individual model. We compare the outcomes with those obtained from human domain experts. It is demonstrated that combining intelligence from multiple ML/AI models using CFA and getting input from human experts can, not only complement, but also enhance each other.

*Mangadoddi Srikar Vardhan,Lekkala Sai Teja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现Transformer隐藏状态中方向（角度）和幅度（向量范数）具有不同功能：角度扰动主要影响语言建模损失，而幅度扰动主要损害句法处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer隐藏状态中方向（向量方向）和幅度（向量范数）是否具有不同的功能角色，特别是在LayerNorm架构中

Method: 使用Pythia系列模型，采用L2匹配扰动分析方法，确保角度和幅度扰动具有相同的欧几里得位移，通过因果干预研究不同扰动的影响路径

Result: 发现显著交叉分离：角度扰动对语言建模损失造成更大损害（高达42.9倍），而幅度扰动对句法处理造成更大损害（主谓一致准确率下降20.4% vs 1.6%）。角度损害主要通过注意力路径传播，幅度损害部分通过LayerNorm路径传播

Conclusion: 在LayerNorm架构中，方向和幅度支持部分不同的计算角色：方向优先影响注意力路由，幅度调节细粒度句法判断的处理强度。RMSNorm架构显示不同模式，表明这种分离依赖于架构选择

Abstract: Transformer hidden states encode information as high-dimensional vectors, yet whether direction (orientation in representational space) and magnitude (vector norm) serve distinct functional roles remains unclear. Studying Pythia-family models, we discover a striking cross-over dissociation: angular perturbations cause up to 42.9 more damage to language modeling loss, while magnitude perturbations cause disproportionately more damage to syntactic processing (20.4% vs.1.6% accuracy drop on subject-verb agreement).This finding is enabled by L2-matched perturbation analysis, a methodology ensuring that an gular and magnitude perturbations achieve identical Euclidean displacements. Causal intervention reveals that angular damage flows substantially through the attention pathways (28.4% loss recovery via attention repair), while magnitude damage flows partly through the LayerNorm pathways(29.9% recovery via LayerNorm repair). These patterns replicate across scales within the Pythia architecture family. These findings provide evidence that direction and magnitude support partially distinct computational roles in LayerNorm based architectures. The direction preferentially affects attentional routing, while magnitude modulates processing intensity for fine-grained syntactic judgments. We find different patterns in RMSNorm-based architectures, suggesting that the dissociation depends on architectural choices. Our results refine the linear representation hypothesis and have implications for model editing and interpretability research

TL;DR: PRIME框架通过三个专门代理（执行器、验证器、协调器）和群体相对策略优化，显著提升大语言模型在算法推理任务上的性能，在PRIME-Bench基准上实现从26.8%到93.8%的准确率提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多样化推理任务上表现出色，但在算法推理方面表现有限，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出PRIME框架，包含三个专门代理：执行器负责逐步推理，验证器进行约束检查，协调器控制回溯，通过群体相对策略优化进行优化。同时构建PRIME-Bench基准，包含86个任务、12个类别、51,600个实例。

Result: PRIME将平均准确率从26.8%提升到93.8%，相对提升250%。在需要持续状态跟踪的任务上改进最大：图灵机模拟从9%提升到92%，长除法从16%提升到94%。迭代验证是主要贡献因素，防止错误传播。小模型受益更大，能达到比其大8倍模型的准确率。

Conclusion: PRIME框架通过专门代理协作和迭代验证，显著提升大语言模型的算法推理能力，特别是对小模型效果更明显，为解决算法推理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks, yet their performance on algorithmic reasoning remains limited. To handle this limitation, we propose PRIME (Policy-Reinforced Iterative Multi-agent Execution), a framework comprising three specialized agents, an executor for step-by-step reasoning, a verifier for constraint checking, and a coordinator for backtracking control, optimized through group relative policy optimization. For comprehensive evaluation, we introduce PRIME-Bench, the largest algorithmic reasoning benchmark to date, comprising 86 tasks across 12 categories with 51,600 instances. Tasks span sorting algorithms, graph and tree structures, automata and state machines, symbolic reasoning, and constraint-based puzzles, with execution traces reaching over one million steps. Compared to baseline approach, PRIME improves average accuracy from 26.8% to 93.8%, a 250% relative gain. The largest improvements occur on tasks requiring sustained state tracking, with Turing machine simulation improving from 9% to 92% and long division from 16% to 94%. Ablation studies identify iterative verification as the primary contributor, preventing the error propagation that causes baseline approaches to fail catastrophically. Analysis across model scales (8B-120B parameters) reveals that smaller models benefit disproportionately, achieving accuracy comparable to models 8x larger.

TL;DR: 提出一个结合LLM领域知识与贝叶斯优化的框架，用于高效搜索LoRA超参数，仅需约30次迭代即可获得比传统方法更好的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然使微调高效，但对超参数选择高度敏感，而穷举搜索计算成本高昂。需要一种能利用预训练LLM领域知识来高效优化LoRA超参数的方法。

Method: 1) 将LLM重新用作离散到连续的映射，将超参数及其领域知识链接到连续向量空间进行贝叶斯优化；2) 通过语言提示设计和控制映射，用自然语言注入LoRA领域知识；3) 用可学习token建模难以语言描述的残差信息；4) 利用完整数据集与子集性能强相关的观察，引入代理训练和评估。

Result: 仅需约30次迭代找到的超参数，相比从约45,000种组合中找到的标准超参数，性能提升超过20%。

Conclusion: 该框架成功整合了LLM领域知识与贝叶斯优化，显著提高了LoRA超参数搜索效率，减少了计算需求，同时获得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables resource-efficient personalization or specialization, but it comes at the expense of additional hyperparameter tuning. Although LoRA makes fine-tuning efficient, it is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters, and exhaustive hyperparameter search is still computationally very demanding. To address these challenges, we propose a framework that integrates the domain knowledge of pre-trained LLMs into Bayesian Optimization (BO) to efficiently search for LoRA hyperparameters. To leverage the informed knowledge of LLMs, we repurpose LLMs as a discrete-to-continuous mapping to link the hyperparameters and their domain knowledge with a continuous vector space, where BO is conducted. We design and control the mapping by language prompting, where we provide a domain-aware textual prompt describing the relationships among hyperparameters and their respective roles; thereby, we explicitly inject domain knowledge about LoRA into the LLM in natural language. Also, we model the residual information that is hard to linguistically describe in the prompt with an additional learnable token. This aids BO to sample more high-performing hyperparameters. In addition, by leveraging the observation of the strong correlation between the respective performance obtained from full and subset training datasets in LoRA training regimes, we introduce proxy training and evaluation with a data subset. This further increases the efficiency of our method. We demonstrate that our hyperparameter found with only about 30 iterations achieves more than 20% performance improvement over standard hyperparameters found from about 45,000 combinations.

TL;DR: 研究评估了Gemini 2.5 Flash和Pro TTS模型在五种印度语言中生成法庭演讲的表现，发现模型在程序性信息传递上表现出"单调权威"，但在情感表达和说服力方面存在不足，特别是在孟加拉语和古吉拉特语中表现更差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律辩护需要权威语气、节奏停顿和情感智能的独特结合。随着LLM发展，TTS技术从基本可理解性转向上下文感知的表达性合成。在印度多语言环境中，合成语音需要传达权威和专业形象，这变得更加复杂。

Method: 提出了一个提示框架，利用Gemini 2.5对五种印度语言的原生支持和上下文感知节奏控制，生成不同的律师角色。评估了模型在泰米尔语、泰卢固语、孟加拉语、印地语和古吉拉特语中生成法庭演讲的表现。

Result: 模型表现出"单调权威"，在程序性信息传递方面表现良好，但在动态声音调节和情感深度方面存在困难。在孟加拉语和古吉拉特语中表现进一步下降，突显了语音学方面的改进空间。

Conclusion: 多语言TTS已准备好用于程序性法律任务，但在复制人类法律话语的说服艺术方面仍面临挑战。研究为未来在语音学前沿的改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Legal advocacy requires a unique combination of authoritative tone, rhythmic pausing for emphasis, and emotional intelligence. This study investigates the performance of the Gemini 2.5 Flash TTS and Gemini 2.5 Pro TTS models in generating synthetic courtroom speeches across five Indic languages: Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Hindi, and Gujarati. We propose a prompting framework that utilizes Gemini 2.5s native support for 5 languages and its context-aware pacing to produce distinct advocate personas. The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shifted the focus of TexttoSpeech (TTS) technology from basic intelligibility to context-aware, expressive synthesis. In the legal domain, synthetic speech must convey authority and a specific professional persona a task that becomes significantly more complex in the linguistically diverse landscape of India. The models exhibit a "monotone authority," excelling at procedural information delivery but struggling with the dynamic vocal modulation and emotive gravitas required for persuasive advocacy. Performance dips in Bengali and Gujarati further highlight phonological frontiers for future refinement. This research underscores the readiness of multilingual TTS for procedural legal tasks while identifying the remaining challenges in replicating the persuasive artistry of human legal discourse.

Motivation: 当前作者回复生成任务被简化为自动文本生成，未能充分利用作者的专业知识和意图。作者在回复审稿意见时拥有领域专业知识、作者独有信息、修订策略等具体形式的专业知识和意图，需要NLP工具整合这些信号来支持有效的同行评审回复写作。

Method: 提出REspGen生成框架，整合显式作者输入、多属性控制和评估引导优化；构建REspEval评估套件，包含20+个指标覆盖输入利用、可控性、回复质量和话语分析；创建Re³Align数据集，这是首个大规模对齐的审稿-回复-修订三元组数据集，修订提供了作者专业知识和意图的信号。

Result: 实验使用最先进的LLM显示：作者输入和评估引导优化带来显著效益；输入设计对回复质量有重要影响；可控性和质量之间存在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 将作者回复生成重构为作者参与循环任务，通过整合作者专业知识和意图，结合多属性控制和评估引导优化，能够显著提升回复生成质量。公开了数据集、生成和评估工具。

Abstract: Author response (rebuttal) writing is a critical stage of scientific peer review that demands substantial author effort. Recent work frames this task as automatic text generation, underusing author expertise and intent. In practice, authors possess domain expertise, author-only information, revision and response strategies--concrete forms of author expertise and intent--to address reviewer concerns, and seek NLP assistance that integrates these signals to support effective response writing in peer review. We reformulate author response generation as an author-in-the-loop task and introduce REspGen, a generation framework that integrates explicit author input, multi-attribute control, and evaluation-guided refinement, together with REspEval, a comprehensive evaluation suite with 20+ metrics covering input utilization, controllability, response quality, and discourse. To support this formulation, we construct Re$^3$Align, the first large-scale dataset of aligned review--response--revision triplets, where revisions provide signals of author expertise and intent. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs show the benefits of author input and evaluation-guided refinement, the impact of input design on response quality, and trade-offs between controllability and quality. We make our dataset, generation and evaluation tools publicly available.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言预训练模型存在"脚本税"问题：不同书写系统的分词效率差异导致处理成本显著不同，高碎片化书写系统在推理速度和信息成本上都有明显劣势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然多语言预训练模型通常被认为是脚本无关的，但分词器可能对某些书写系统施加系统性成本。研究旨在量化这种"脚本税"，揭示不同书写系统在模型处理中的不平等现象。

Method: 通过比较具有相同语言内容但不同正字法变体的文本，使用比特每字符(BPC)指标避免子词碎片化带来的"NLL悖论"，分析分词碎片化程度对模型性能的影响。

Result: 高碎片化正字法导致分词数量增加约3.4倍(6.73-6.85 vs 2.10-2.35 tokens/word)，推理速度降低16.5倍(0.23 vs 3.8 sentences/second)。信息成本显著增加：mBERT增加19.7%，XLM-R增加47.1%。

Conclusion: 分词是多语言NLP中不平等的关键来源，研究结果强调了脚本感知的分词和预训练的重要性，需要开发更公平的多语言处理系统。

Abstract: Pretrained multilingual language models are often assumed to be script-agnostic, yet their tokenizers can impose systematic costs on certain writing systems. We quantify this script tax by comparing two orthographic variants with identical linguistic content. Across mBERT and XLM-R, the higher-fragmentation orthography shows a ~3.4x increase in fertility (6.73-6.85 vs. 2.10-2.35 tokens/word), leading to a 16.5x inference slowdown (0.23 vs. 3.8 sentences/second) on identical hardware. Using bits per character (BPC) to avoid the "NLL paradox" from subword fragmentation, we find a substantial increase in information cost: +19.7% for mBERT (8.06->9.65) and +47.1% for XLM-R (12.19->17.94). A round-trip conversion check (CER_rt=0.31) suggests these gaps reflect orthography-conditioned processing rather than mapping noise. Our results highlight tokenization as a key source of inequity in multilingual NLP and motivate script-aware tokenization and pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer已成为序列建模的基础架构，在自然语言处理、视觉等领域取得显著成功。然而，其在算术、逻辑推理、算法组合等离散推理任务中的理论局限性仍是一个关键开放问题，需要系统性的理论分析。

Method: 从三个理论视角综合近期研究：1) 电路复杂性分析Transformer的结构计算能力；2) 逼近理论研究Transformer对离散函数的近似能力；3) 通信复杂性分析token间信息交换的瓶颈。通过连接这些理论框架，提供统一的理论解释。

Result: 揭示了Transformer在离散推理任务中的核心限制：深度约束、难以逼近不连续性、token间通信瓶颈。这些理论障碍解释了为何Transformer擅长模式匹配和插值，但难以实现精确的离散算法。

Conclusion: Transformer在离散推理任务中存在基础性理论限制。本文通过多理论框架的统一分析，为理解这些限制提供了系统视角，并讨论了模型设计的影响和未来克服这些限制的潜在方向。

Abstract: Transformers have become the foundational architecture for a broad spectrum of sequence modeling applications, underpinning state-of-the-art systems in natural language processing, vision, and beyond. However, their theoretical limitations in discrete reasoning tasks, such as arithmetic, logical inference, and algorithmic composition, remain a critical open problem. In this survey, we synthesize recent studies from three theoretical perspectives: circuit complexity, approximation theory, and communication complexity, to clarify the structural and computational barriers that transformers face when performing symbolic computations. By connecting these established theoretical frameworks, we provide an accessible and unified account of why current transformer architectures struggle to implement exact discrete algorithms, even as they excel at pattern matching and interpolation. We review key definitions, seminal results, and illustrative examples, highlighting challenges such as depth constraints, difficulty approximating discontinuities, and bottlenecks in inter-token communication. Finally, we discuss implications for model design and suggest promising directions for overcoming these foundational limitations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的智能体模型在低数据环境下表现不佳，限制了在智能家居自动化、人机协作等应用中的实用性。研究探索预训练大语言模型是否能利用广泛的人类知识，从紧凑上下文线索中推理日常活动。

Method: 采用检索增强提示策略，整合四种上下文来源：时间、空间、行为历史和人物特征。在CASAS Aruba智能家居数据集上评估两个任务：带持续时间估计的下一个活动预测，以及多步日常序列生成，测试不同数量的few-shot示例。

Result: LLMs表现出强大的内在时序理解能力：即使在零样本设置下也能产生连贯的日常活动预测，添加1-2个示例能进一步优化持续时间校准和分类准确性。超过几个示例后性能饱和，呈现收益递减。序列级评估显示跨few-shot条件的一致时序对齐。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型可作为有前景的时序推理器，既能捕捉重复的日常规律，又能处理上下文依赖的行为变化，从而增强基于智能体的行为模块，在低数据环境中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Anticipating human activities and their durations is essential in applications such as smart-home automation, simulation-based architectural and urban design, activity-based transportation system simulation, and human-robot collaboration, where adaptive systems must respond to human activities. Existing data-driven agent-based models--from rule-based to deep learning--struggle in low-data environments, limiting their practicality. This paper investigates whether large language models, pre-trained on broad human knowledge, can fill this gap by reasoning about everyday activities from compact contextual cues. We adopt a retrieval-augmented prompting strategy that integrates four sources of context--temporal, spatial, behavioral history, and persona--and evaluate it on the CASAS Aruba smart-home dataset. The evaluation spans two complementary tasks: next-activity prediction with duration estimation, and multi-step daily sequence generation, each tested with various numbers of few-shot examples provided in the prompt. Analyzing few-shot effects reveals how much contextual supervision is sufficient to balance data efficiency and predictive accuracy, particularly in low-data environments. Results show that large language models exhibit strong inherent temporal understanding of human behavior: even in zero-shot settings, they produce coherent daily activity predictions, while adding one or two demonstrations further refines duration calibration and categorical accuracy. Beyond a few examples, performance saturates, indicating diminishing returns. Sequence-level evaluation confirms consistent temporal alignment across few-shot conditions. These findings suggest that pre-trained language models can serve as promising temporal reasoners, capturing both recurring routines and context-dependent behavioral variations, thereby strengthening the behavioral modules of agent-based models.

Conclusion: 通过分析LLM内部表示来理解AD检测机制，并利用任务感知标记生成合成数据的方法，为解决AD领域标注数据不足问题提供了新途径，有望提高早期检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Reliable early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is challenging, particularly due to limited availability of labeled data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong transfer capabilities across domains, adapting them to the AD domain through supervised fine-tuning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we fine-tune an LLM for AD detection and investigate how task-relevant information is encoded within its internal representations. We employ probing techniques to analyze intermediate activations across transformer layers, and we observe that, after fine-tuning, the probing values of specific words and special markers change substantially, indicating that these elements assume a crucial role in the model's improved detection performance. Guided by this insight, we design a curated set of task-aware special markers and train a sequence-to-sequence model as a data-synthesis tool that leverages these markers to generate structurally consistent and diagnostically informative synthetic samples. We evaluate the synthesized data both intrinsically and by incorporating it into downstream training pipelines.

This approach, which requires instructions to be composed in natural language to bring out the knowledge from LLMs in a structured way, has driven breakthroughs in various NLP tasks. Yet there is still no structured framework or coherent understanding of the varied prompt engineering methods and techniques, particularly in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG).
  This survey aims to help fill that gap by outlining recent developments in prompt engineering, and their effect on different NLG tasks. It reviews recent advances in prompting methods and their impact on NLG tasks, presenting prompt design as an input-level control mechanism that complements fine-tuning and decoding approaches. The paper introduces a taxonomy of prompting paradigms, a decision framework for prompt selection based on varying factors for the practitioners, outlines emerging trends and challenges, and proposes a framework that links design, optimization, and evaluation to support more controllable and generalizable NLG.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, yet their internal decision-making processes remain largely opaque. Mechanistic interpretability (i.e., the systematic study of how neural networks implement algorithms through their learned representations and computational structures) has emerged as a critical research direction for understanding and aligning these models. This paper surveys recent progress in mechanistic interpretability techniques applied to LLM alignment, examining methods ranging from circuit discovery to feature visualization, activation steering, and causal intervention. We analyze how interpretability insights have informed alignment strategies including reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), constitutional AI, and scalable oversight. Key challenges are identified, including the superposition hypothesis, polysemanticity of neurons, and the difficulty of interpreting emergent behaviors in large-scale models. We propose future research directions focusing on automated interpretability, cross-model generalization of circuits, and the development of interpretability-driven alignment techniques that can scale to frontier models.

Abstract: Code-mixing and code-switching (CSW) remain challenging phenomena for large language models (LLMs). Despite recent advances in multilingual modeling, LLMs often struggle in mixed-language settings, exhibiting systematic degradation in grammaticality, factuality, and safety behavior. This work provides a comprehensive overview of CSW research in modern large language model settings. We introduce a unifying taxonomy that organizes prior work along dimensions of data, modeling, and evaluation, and we distill these findings into a practical playbook of actionable recommendations for building, adapting, and evaluating CSW-capable LLMs. We review modeling approaches ranging from CSW-tailored pre-training and task-specific post-training to prompting strategies and in-context learning. We analyze current evaluation practices, highlighting sources of instability and limited reproducibility, and we catalog existing benchmarks while critically examining their linguistic coverage and English-centric biases. Finally, we discuss emerging safety concerns, including use of code-mixing as a mechanism for bypassing model safeguards, and identify open research challenges.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统虽然能让LLM支持长时人机交互，但往往破坏了交互会话的内在逻辑和时间关系，导致记忆单元碎片化和推理性能下降。

Method: MetaMem框架通过自演化元记忆增强记忆系统，在元记忆优化过程中，通过自我反思推理过程和执行动作来更新当前元记忆状态，跨任务蒸馏可迁移的知识利用经验。

Result: 大量实验证明MetaMem的有效性，显著优于强基线方法超过3.6%。所有代码和数据集已在GitHub开源。

Conclusion: MetaMem通过元记忆机制教导LLM如何有效利用记忆知识，解决了现有记忆系统导致的记忆碎片化问题，提升了长时交互中的推理性能。

Abstract: Existing memory systems enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to support long-horizon human-LLM interactions by persisting historical interactions beyond limited context windows. However, while recent approaches have succeeded in constructing effective memories, they often disrupt the inherent logical and temporal relationships within interaction sessions, resulting in fragmented memory units and degraded reasoning performance. In this paper, we propose MetaMem, a novel framework that augments memory systems with a self-evolving meta-memory, aiming to teach LLMs how to effectively utilize memorized knowledge. During meta-memory optimization, MetaMem iteratively distills transferable knowledge utilization experiences across different tasks by self-reflecting on reasoning processes and performing actions to update the current meta-memory state. The accumulated meta-memory units serve as explicit knowledge utilization experiences, guiding the LLM to systematically identify and integrate critical evidence from scattered memory fragments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaMem, which significantly outperforms strong baselines by over 3.6%.

TL;DR: 提出了DDL2PropBank基准任务，用于评估多智能体框架的开发体验，通过静态分析和AI辅助性两个维度比较了10个框架，发现Agno综合表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体框架承诺简化LLM驱动的软件开发，但缺乏在受控环境中评估其开发体验的原则性方法。

Method: 引入DDL2PropBank基准任务（将关系数据库模式映射到PropBank角色集），采用工具即智能体模式，在10个框架中实现相同的智能体逻辑，通过静态分析评估代码复杂度，通过AI辅助性评估LLM自动生成正确框架特定代码的能力。

Result: 发现三倍复杂度谱系，Pydantic AI和Agno实现开销最小；对于AI辅助性，结构对齐分数能可靠代理单规范模式框架的运行时成功，但对多模式框架高估正确性；Agno综合表现最强，复杂度最低，结构对齐最高，pass@1达到83%。

Conclusion: DDL2PropBank提供了评估多智能体框架开发体验的原则性方法，Agno在复杂度和AI辅助性方面表现最佳，为框架选择提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Multi-agent frameworks promise to simplify LLM-driven software development, yet there is no principled way to evaluate their developer experience in a controlled setting. We introduce DDL2PropBank, a novel benchmark task that maps relational database schemas to PropBank rolesets, requiring autonomous retrieval of candidate frames and fine-grained linguistic reasoning over table names, columns, and relations. Using the Agent-as-a-Tool pattern, we implement identical agent logic across 10 frameworks and evaluate along two dimensions: (i) code complexity via static analysis, and (ii) AI-assistability -- the extent to which LLMs can autonomously generate correct, framework-specific code. Our results reveal a threefold complexity spectrum, with Pydantic AI and Agno requiring the least implementation overhead. For AI-assistability, structural alignment scores reliably proxy runtime success for frameworks with single canonical patterns, but overestimate correctness for multi-pattern frameworks. Agno emerges as the strongest overall performer, combining lowest complexity with highest structural alignment and 83% pass@1.

TL;DR: 论文提出AskBench基准测试和RLVR方法，用于评估和改进LLM在需要澄清时的提问能力，包括意图缺失和错误前提两种场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常在提示缺少关键细节或包含误导信息时仍会回应，导致幻觉或强化误解。需要评估和改进LLM决定何时以及如何请求澄清的能力，同时不牺牲任务性能。

Method: 提出AskBench交互式基准测试，将标准QA对转换为具有明确检查点的多轮交互。包含AskMind（意图缺失查询）和AskOverconfidence（包含错误前提查询）两种设置。进一步提出基于验证器的奖励强化学习（RLVR），使用结构化评分标准鼓励有针对性的澄清。

Result: 实验显示在准确性、评分标准遵循度和交互效率方面都有持续改进，并且对未见领域有很强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM在需要澄清时的提问能力，减少了幻觉和误解，同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond even when prompts omit critical details or include misleading information, leading to hallucinations or reinforced misconceptions. We study how to evaluate and improve LLMs' ability to decide when and what to ask for clarification without sacrificing task performance. We introduce AskBench, an interactive benchmark that converts standard QA pairs into multi-turn interactions with explicit checkpoints. A unified judge loop evaluates final answers and simulates user responses as needed. AskBench covers two settings: AskMind, with intent-deficient queries requiring clarification, and AskOverconfidence, with queries containing false premises that must be identified and corrected. We further propose rubric-guided reinforcement learning with verifier-based rewards (RLVR), which uses structured rubrics to encourage targeted clarification. Experiments show consistent improvements in accuracy, rubric adherence, and interaction efficiency, with strong generalization to unseen domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了NLDD指标来评估思维链解释是否忠实反映模型决策过程，发现模型存在约70-85%的"推理视界"，超过此范围的推理步骤对最终答案影响甚微。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前广泛使用的思维链解释存在一个根本问题：无法确定这些逐步解释是真实反映了模型如何得出答案，还是仅仅是事后合理化。需要一种方法来衡量思维链解释是否忠实于模型的实际决策过程。

Method: 提出归一化对数差异衰减指标，通过破坏思维链解释中的单个推理步骤，测量模型对其答案置信度的下降程度，从而确定该步骤是否真正重要。该方法标准化测量结果，支持跨不同架构模型的严格比较。

Result: 在句法、逻辑和算术任务上测试三个模型系列，发现一致的"推理视界"现象：在思维链长度的70-85%处，超过此范围的推理标记对最终答案影响很小甚至为负。同时发现模型可以编码正确的内部表示却完全无法完成任务。

Conclusion: 仅凭准确性无法揭示模型是否真正通过思维链进行推理。NLDD提供了一种衡量思维链何时真正重要的方法，揭示了模型推理过程的局限性。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) explanations are widely used to interpret how language models solve complex problems, yet it remains unclear whether these step-by-step explanations reflect how the model actually reaches its answer, or merely post-hoc justifications. We propose Normalized Logit Difference Decay (NLDD), a metric that measures whether individual reasoning steps are faithful to the model's decision-making process. Our approach corrupts individual reasoning steps from the explanation and measures how much the model's confidence in its answer drops, to determine if a step is truly important. By standardizing these measurements, NLDD enables rigorous cross-model comparison across different architectures. Testing three model families across syntactic, logical, and arithmetic tasks, we discover a consistent Reasoning Horizon (k*) at 70--85% of chain length, beyond which reasoning tokens have little or negative effect on the final answer. We also find that models can encode correct internal representations while completely failing the task. These results show that accuracy alone does not reveal whether a model actually reasons through its chain. NLDD offers a way to measure when CoT matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动综述生成（ASG）评估方法依赖通用指标且偏向计算机科学，无法评估ASG方法是否符合不同学科的特定标准，导致非CS领域研究者缺乏使用指导。

Method: 构建SurveyLens-1k数据集（1000篇高质量人工综述，涵盖10个学科），提出双视角评估框架：1）学科感知评分表评估（使用LLM和人类偏好对齐权重）；2）规范对齐评估（测量内容覆盖和综合质量）。

Result: 评估了11种最先进的ASG方法（包括普通LLM、ASG系统和深度研究代理），揭示了每种范式在不同领域的独特优势和弱点。

Conclusion: SurveyLens填补了跨学科ASG评估的空白，为根据特定学科要求选择工具提供了重要指导。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has driven the evolution of Automatic Survey Generation (ASG) from simple pipelines to multi-agent frameworks and commercial Deep Research agents. However, current ASG evaluation methods rely on generic metrics and are heavily biased toward Computer Science (CS), failing to assess whether ASG methods adhere to the distinct standards of various academic disciplines. Consequently, researchers, especially those outside CS, lack clear guidance on using ASG systems to yield high-quality surveys compliant with specific discipline standards. To bridge this gap, we introduce SurveyLens, the first discipline-aware benchmark evaluating ASG methods across diverse research disciplines. We construct SurveyLens-1k, a curated dataset of 1,000 high-quality human-written surveys spanning 10 disciplines. Subsequently, we propose a dual-lens evaluation framework: (1) Discipline-Aware Rubric Evaluation, which utilizes LLMs with human preference-aligned weights to assess adherence to domain-specific writing standards; and (2) Canonical Alignment Evaluation to rigorously measure content coverage and synthesis quality against human-written survey papers. We conduct extensive experiments by evaluating 11 state-of-the-art ASG methods on SurveyLens, including Vanilla LLMs, ASG systems, and Deep Research agents. Our analysis reveals the distinct strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm across fields, providing essential guidance for selecting tools tailored to specific disciplinary requirements.

TL;DR: Mis-Align Bench：首个统一评估LLM在安全、价值观和文化三个维度错位的基准，包含38万+样本，揭示单维度模型在联合条件下表现不佳


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有错位基准（如INSECURE CODE、VALUEACTIONLENS、CULTURALHERITAGE）仅评估单一维度，无法同时评估安全、价值观和文化三个必须共存的维度，无法反映真实世界查询的复杂性

Method: 1. 构建SAVACU数据集：将LLM-PROMPT-DATASET重新分类为14个安全域、56个价值观域和42个文化域，使用Mistral-7B和Llama-3.1扩展低资源域，通过两阶段拒绝采样配对错位和对齐响应；2. 建立统一基准评估通用、微调和开源LLM

Result: 单维度模型在覆盖率上可达97.6%，但在联合条件下假失败率超过50%，对齐分数仅63%-66%，表明单一维度评估无法准确反映模型在真实场景中的表现

Conclusion: 需要统一的多维度错位评估基准，Mis-Align Bench填补了这一空白，为全面评估LLM在安全、价值观和文化维度的对齐性提供了系统工具

Abstract: Misalignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) arises when model behavior diverges from human expectations and fails to simultaneously satisfy safety, value, and cultural dimensions, which must co-occur in real-world settings to solve a real-world query. Existing misalignment benchmarks-such as INSECURE CODE (safety-centric), VALUEACTIONLENS (value-centric), and CULTURALHERITAGE (culture centric)-rely on evaluating misalignment along individual dimensions, preventing simultaneous evaluation. To address this gap, we introduce Mis-Align Bench, a unified benchmark for analyzing misalignment across safety, value, and cultural dimensions. First we constructs SAVACU, an English misaligned-aligned dataset of 382,424 samples spanning 112 domains (or labels), by reclassifying prompts from the LLM-PROMPT-DATASET via taxonomy into 14 safety domains, 56 value domains, and 42 cultural domains using Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, and expanding low-resource domains via Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with SimHash-based fingerprint to avoid deduplication. Furthermore, we pairs prompts with misaligned and aligned responses via two-stage rejection sampling to enforce quality. Second we benchmarks general-purpose, fine-tuned, and open-weight LLMs, enabling systematic evaluation of misalignment under three dimensions. Empirically, single-dimension models achieve high Coverage (upto 97.6%) but incur False Failure Rate >50% and lower Alignment Score (63%-66%) under joint conditions.

TL;DR: 研究LLM在社交情境中的行为倾向与人类对齐程度，发现LLM常表现出过度自信、偏离人类共识，且自我报告价值观与实际行为存在差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM融入日常生活，理解其行为变得至关重要。研究关注LLM在社交情境中的行为倾向（行为倾向）与人类的对齐程度，以评估LLM的社会适应性

Method: 将心理学问卷转化为情境判断测试（SJTs），创建2,500个经过人工验证的SJTs，收集550名参与者的偏好数据，评估25个LLM在现实用户-助手场景中的行为推荐

Result: 1) 在人类共识低的场景中，LLM对单一回答表现出过度自信；2) 人类共识高时，小模型显著偏离，前沿模型在15-20%情况下未反映共识；3) LLM行为特征呈现跨模型模式，如在人类偏好冷静时鼓励情绪表达；4) LLM自我报告价值观与实际行为存在显著差距

Conclusion: LLM的行为倾向与人类偏好存在系统性偏差，需要改进对齐方法。研究框架为评估LLM社会行为提供了有效工具，揭示了价值观声明与实际行为之间的预测效度差距

Abstract: As LLMs integrate into our daily lives, understanding their behavior becomes essential. In this work, we focus on behavioral dispositions$-$the underlying tendencies that shape responses in social contexts$-$and introduce a framework to study how closely the dispositions expressed by LLMs align with those of humans. Our approach is grounded in established psychological questionnaires but adapts them for LLMs by transforming human self-report statements into Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs). These SJTs assess behavior by eliciting natural recommendations in realistic user-assistant scenarios. We generate 2,500 SJTs, each validated by three human annotators, and collect preferred actions from 10 annotators per SJT, from a large pool of 550 participants. In a comprehensive study involving 25 LLMs, we find that models often do not reflect the distribution of human preferences: (1) in scenarios with low human consensus, LLMs consistently exhibit overconfidence in a single response; (2) when human consensus is high, smaller models deviate significantly, and even some frontier models do not reflect the consensus in 15-20% of cases; (3) traits can exhibit cross-LLM patterns, e.g., LLMs may encourage emotion expression in contexts where human consensus favors composure. Lastly, mapping psychometric statements directly to behavioral scenarios presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the predictive validity of self-reports, revealing considerable gaps between LLMs' stated values and their revealed behavior.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型的自我反思语言能可靠追踪内部计算状态，而非仅仅是语言幻觉。通过Pull方法识别出自指处理方向，该方向与拒绝方向正交，位于模型深度6.25%处，能因果影响内省输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是澄清大型语言模型产生的内省语言是否反映真实的内部计算过程，还是仅仅是复杂的语言幻觉。需要验证自我报告是否可靠追踪内部状态。

Method: 引入Pull方法学，通过格式工程引发扩展的自我检查。识别激活空间中区分自指处理和描述处理的方向。分析特定词汇（如"loop"、"shimmer"）与激活动态的对应关系，并在不同模型（Llama 3.1、Qwen 2.5-32B）中验证。

Result: 发现自指词汇能追踪并发激活动态，且这种对应关系特定于自指处理。自指方向与已知拒绝方向正交，位于模型深度6.25%处，能因果影响内省输出。特定词汇与激活指标显著相关（如"loop"词汇对应更高自相关r=0.44），而相同词汇在非自指语境中无对应关系。不同模型独立发展出不同的内省词汇追踪不同的激活指标。

Conclusion: 在适当条件下，Transformer模型中的自我报告能可靠追踪内部计算状态，表明模型的内省语言并非纯粹的语言幻觉，而是反映了真实的内部处理过程。

Abstract: Large language models produce rich introspective language when prompted for self-examination, but whether this language reflects internal computation or sophisticated confabulation has remained unclear. We show that self-referential vocabulary tracks concurrent activation dynamics, and that this correspondence is specific to self-referential processing. We introduce the Pull Methodology, a protocol that elicits extended self-examination through format engineering, and use it to identify a direction in activation space that distinguishes self-referential from descriptive processing in Llama 3.1. The direction is orthogonal to the known refusal direction, localised at 6.25% of model depth, and causally influences introspective output when used for steering. When models produce "loop" vocabulary, their activations exhibit higher autocorrelation (r = 0.44, p = 0.002); when they produce "shimmer" vocabulary under steering, activation variability increases (r = 0.36, p = 0.002). Critically, the same vocabulary in non-self-referential contexts shows no activation correspondence despite nine-fold higher frequency. Qwen 2.5-32B, with no shared training, independently develops different introspective vocabulary tracking different activation metrics, all absent in descriptive controls. The findings indicate that self-report in transformer models can, under appropriate conditions, reliably track internal computational states.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现下降，主要因为幻觉和中间步骤错误累积。现有方法试图通过替换关键令牌来优化推理轨迹，但可靠识别和利用关键令牌仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出PPCV框架，包含两个阶段：1) 通过问题转述和推理路径对比识别关键令牌；2) 替换关键令牌并生成新推理路径，通过并行推理过程的一致性验证确定最终答案。

Result: 在主流大语言模型和多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PPCV相比基线方法显著提升了模型的推理性能。

Conclusion: PPCV框架通过系统性地识别和替换关键令牌，结合一致性验证机制，有效提升了大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance across a variety of reasoning tasks. However, their problem-solving ability often declines on more complex tasks due to hallucinations and the accumulation of errors within these intermediate steps. Recent work has introduced the notion of critical tokens--tokens in the reasoning process that exert significant influence on subsequent steps. Prior studies suggest that replacing critical tokens can refine reasoning trajectories. Nonetheless, reliably identifying and exploiting critical tokens remains challenging. To address this, we propose the Paraphrastic Probing and Consistency Verification~(PPCV) framework. PPCV operates in two stages. In the first stage, we roll out an initial reasoning path from the original question and then concatenate paraphrased versions of the question with this reasoning path. And we identify critical tokens based on mismatches between the predicted top-1 token and the expected token in the reasoning path. A criterion is employed to confirm the final critical token. In the second stage, we substitute critical tokens with candidate alternatives and roll out new reasoning paths for both the original and paraphrased questions. The final answer is determined by checking the consistency of outputs across these parallel reasoning processes. We evaluate PPCV on mainstream LLMs across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate PPCV substantially enhances the reasoning performance of LLMs compared to baselines.

TL;DR: DiffuTruth：基于非平衡热力学的无监督事实核查框架，通过生成应力测试和语义能量度量来检测LLM幻觉，在FEVER数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生看似合理但错误的主张（幻觉），而现有的不确定性度量在模型自信地犯错时往往无法检测到这些错误。需要一种能够识别深层事实矛盾的方法。

Method: 提出DiffuTruth框架，将事实核查重新概念化为非平衡热力学过程：事实真相作为生成流形上的稳定吸引子，幻觉则是不稳定的。使用生成应力测试：通过离散文本扩散模型对声明添加噪声并重建；定义语义能量度量，使用NLI批评器测量原始声明与重建之间的语义分歧；提出混合校准方法，融合稳定性信号与判别性置信度。

Result: 在FEVER数据集上达到0.725的无监督AUROC，比基线方法提升1.5%；在HOVER多跳数据集上零样本泛化性能优于基线超过4%，验证了热力学真理属性对分布偏移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiffuTruth通过热力学稳定性视角有效检测LLM幻觉，语义能量能够捕捉深层事实矛盾，混合校准方法显著改善了过度自信预测的校正，展示了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently hallucinate plausible but incorrect assertions, a vulnerability often missed by uncertainty metrics when models are confidently wrong. We propose DiffuTruth, an unsupervised framework that reconceptualizes fact verification via non equilibrium thermodynamics, positing that factual truths act as stable attractors on a generative manifold while hallucinations are unstable. We introduce the Generative Stress Test, claims are corrupted with noise and reconstructed using a discrete text diffusion model. We define Semantic Energy, a metric measuring the semantic divergence between the original claim and its reconstruction using an NLI critic. Unlike vector space errors, Semantic Energy isolates deep factual contradictions. We further propose a Hybrid Calibration fusing this stability signal with discriminative confidence. Extensive experiments on FEVER demonstrate DiffuTruth achieves a state of the art unsupervised AUROC of 0.725, outperforming baselines by 1.5 percent through the correction of overconfident predictions. Furthermore, we show superior zero shot generalization on the multi hop HOVER dataset, outperforming baselines by over 4 percent, confirming the robustness of thermodynamic truth properties to distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 开发了一个患者模拟器，用于自动化评估医疗对话AI，通过系统变化医疗、语言和行为维度生成可控的患者交互，发现AI决策辅助在健康素养谱系中性能单调下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要可扩展、自动化的方法来评估医疗对话AI的性能，特别是在识别幻觉、错误和风险模式方面，以应对不同患者群体的多样性。

Result: 生成500个对话，人类标注者评估1,787个医疗概念，达成高一致性(F1=0.94, κ=0.73)，LLM法官与人类标注者一致性相当(F1=0.94, κ=0.78)。模拟器显示AI决策辅助在健康素养谱系中性能单调下降：有限健康素养的排名第一概念检索准确率为47.9%，功能性为69.1%，熟练为81.6%。

Conclusion: 患者模拟器提供了一种可扩展、系统化的方法来评估医疗对话AI，能够识别性能差异和风险模式，特别是在健康素养等关键维度上，为AI医疗工具的评估和改进提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Objective: This paper introduces a patient simulator designed to enable scalable, automated evaluation of healthcare conversational agents. The simulator generates realistic, controllable patient interactions that systematically vary across medical, linguistic, and behavioral dimensions, allowing annotators and an independent AI judge to assess agent performance, identify hallucinations and inaccuracies, and characterize risk patterns across diverse patient populations. Methods: The simulator is grounded in the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and integrates three profile components reflecting different dimensions of patient variation: (1) medical profiles constructed from electronic health records in the All of Us Research Program; (2) linguistic profiles modeling variation in health literacy and condition-specific communication patterns; and (3) behavioral profiles representing empirically observed interaction patterns, including cooperation, distraction, and adversarial engagement. We evaluated the simulator's effectiveness in identifying errors in an AI decision aid for antidepressant selection. Results: We generated 500 conversations between the patient simulator and the AI decision aid across systematic combinations of five linguistic and three behavioral profiles. Human annotators assessed 1,787 medical concepts across 100 conversations, achieving high agreement (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.73), and the LLM judge achieved comparable agreement with human annotators (F1=0.94, \k{appa}=0.78; paired bootstrap p=0.21). The simulator revealed a monotonic degradation in AI decision aid performance across the health literacy spectrum: rank-one concept retrieval accuracy increased from 47.9% for limited health literacy to 69.1% for functional and 81.6% for proficient.

TL;DR: DEFT是一种参数自由的动态熵微调方法，通过基于分布浓度的信任门控机制，解决SFT中均匀令牌加权导致的塑性-稳定性困境，实现探索与利用的更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准负对数似然（NLL）在监督微调（SFT）中采用均匀令牌级加权，这种刚性导致两个失败模式：1）对低概率目标的过度强调会放大噪声监督的梯度并破坏稳健先验；2）当模型已经自信时，均匀加权提供的锐化效果较弱。现有方法未能解决由此产生的塑性-稳定性困境，常常同时抑制必要的学习信号和有害信号。

Method: 作者将令牌级SFT目标统一在广义变形对数族中，揭示了一个通用的门×误差梯度结构，其中门控制模型对其当前预测的信任程度。通过使用凯莱变换，将模型不断演化的不确定性映射到连续焦点轨迹上，实现在不确定新概念和已建立知识之间的无缝插值。然后提出动态熵微调（DEFT），这是一种参数自由的目标，使用分布浓度（Rényi-2熵）作为模型预测状态的实用代理来调制信任门。

Result: 广泛的实验和分析表明，DEFT在探索和利用之间实现了更好的平衡，从而提高了整体性能。

Conclusion: DEFT通过动态调整信任门控机制，有效解决了SFT中的塑性-稳定性困境，为监督微调提供了一种更平衡、更有效的方法。

Abstract: Standard negative log-likelihood (NLL) for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) applies uniform token-level weighting. This rigidity creates a two-fold failure mode: (i) overemphasizing low-probability targets can amplify gradients on noisy supervision and disrupt robust priors, and (ii) uniform weighting provides weak sharpening when the model is already confident. Existing methods fail to resolve the resulting plasticity--stability dilemma, often suppressing necessary learning signals alongside harmful ones. To address this issue, we unify token-level SFT objectives within a generalized deformed-log family and expose a universal gate $\times$ error gradient structure, where the gate controls how much the model trusts its current prediction. By employing the Cayley transform, we map the model's continuously evolving uncertainty onto a continuous focus trajectory, which enables seamless interpolation between scenarios involving uncertain novel concepts and those involving well-established knowledge. We then introduce Dynamic Entropy Fine-Tuning (DEFT), a parameter-free objective that modulates the trust gate using distribution concentration (Rényi-2 entropy) as a practical proxy for the model's predictive state. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that DEFT achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to improved overall performance.

TL;DR: 指令调优的大语言模型在机器翻译关键错误检测方面表现出色，通过模型缩放和适应策略（零样本、少样本、微调）持续改进，超越编码器基线模型，有助于构建更安全、可信的多语言AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器翻译中的关键错误（如事实扭曲、意图反转或偏见翻译）会破坏多语言系统的可靠性、公平性和安全性，需要有效的检测方法来减少错误信息、误解和语言伤害的风险。

Method: 探索指令调优的大语言模型检测关键错误的能力，使用公开数据集评估不同参数规模的模型，采用零样本、少样本和微调等适应策略，并与XLM-R和ModernBERT等编码器基线模型进行比较。

Result: 模型缩放和适应策略带来一致的性能改进，指令调优的大语言模型在关键错误检测方面优于编码器基线模型，表明大语言模型在提高翻译质量监控方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 改进机器翻译中的关键错误检测有助于构建更安全、可信和负责任的多语言信息系统，将错误检测定位为追求公正和负责任多语言AI的必要保障措施，而不仅仅是技术挑战。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) plays a pivotal role in cross-lingual information access, public policy communication, and equitable knowledge dissemination. However, critical meaning errors, such as factual distortions, intent reversals, or biased translations, can undermine the reliability, fairness, and safety of multilingual systems. In this work, we explore the capacity of instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect such critical errors, evaluating models across a range of parameters using the publicly accessible data sets. Our findings show that model scaling and adaptation strategies (zero-shot, few-shot, fine-tuning) yield consistent improvements, outperforming encoder-only baselines like XLM-R and ModernBERT. We argue that improving critical error detection in MT contributes to safer, more trustworthy, and socially accountable information systems by reducing the risk of disinformation, miscommunication, and linguistic harm, especially in high-stakes or underrepresented contexts. This work positions error detection not merely as a technical challenge, but as a necessary safeguard in the pursuit of just and responsible multilingual AI. The code will be made available at GitHub.

TL;DR: LoopFormer：一种通过可变长度轨迹训练的循环Transformer，能够在不同计算预算下自适应调整计算深度，实现预算感知的语言建模和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有循环Transformer在训练和推理时固定循环迭代次数，无法灵活适应不同计算预算。本文旨在探索循环架构是否能在可变计算预算下自适应调整计算深度，实现可控的预算感知大语言模型。

Method: 提出LoopFormer，采用捷径一致性训练方案，对齐不同长度的轨迹，确保短循环产生信息表示而长循环继续优化。每个循环基于当前时间和步长进行条件化，使表示在不同长度轨迹间一致演化而非漂移或停滞。

Result: LoopFormer在语言建模和推理基准测试中表现出鲁棒性能，即使在严格计算约束下也能保持良好表现，同时能优雅地随额外预算扩展。实验证明循环Transformer天生适合自适应语言建模。

Conclusion: 循环Transformer具有自适应语言建模的内在优势，为可控和预算感知的大语言模型开辟了新路径。LoopFormer展示了在可变计算预算下保持性能的能力，是迈向更高效、更灵活语言模型的重要一步。

Abstract: Looped Transformers have emerged as an efficient and powerful class of models for reasoning in the language domain. Recent studies show that these models achieve strong performance on algorithmic and reasoning tasks, suggesting that looped architectures possess an inductive bias toward latent reasoning. However, prior approaches fix the number of loop iterations during training and inference, leaving open the question of whether these models can flexibly adapt their computational depth under variable compute budgets. We introduce LoopFormer, a looped Transformer trained on variable-length trajectories to enable budget-conditioned reasoning. Our core contribution is a shortcut-consistency training scheme that aligns trajectories of different lengths, ensuring that shorter loops yield informative representations while longer loops continue to refine them. LoopFormer conditions each loop on the current time and step size, enabling representations to evolve consistently across trajectories of varying length rather than drifting or stagnating. Empirically, LoopFormer demonstrates robust performance on language modeling and reasoning benchmarks even under aggressive compute constraints, while scaling gracefully with additional budget. These results show that looped Transformers are inherently suited for adaptive language modeling, opening a path toward controllable and budget-aware large language models.

TL;DR: ADRD-Bench是首个针对阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）的LLM评估基准，包含1352个临床知识问题和149个照护实践问题，评估了33个先进LLM，结果显示顶级模型准确率超过90%，但推理质量和稳定性仍需改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估基准对阿尔茨海默病及相关痴呆症（ADRD）的覆盖不足，缺乏实际照护场景的评估，需要专门的ADRD评估基准来全面评估LLM在该领域的知识和推理能力。

Method: 构建ADRD-Bench基准数据集，包含两个部分：1）ADRD统一问答（1352个问题），整合自七个现有医学基准；2）ADRD照护问答（149个问题），基于Aging Brain Care（ABC）项目开发，涵盖实际照护场景。评估了33个最先进的LLM，包括开源通用模型、开源医学模型和闭源通用模型。

Result: 开源通用模型准确率0.63-0.93（平均0.78），开源医学模型0.48-0.93（平均0.82），闭源通用模型0.83-0.91（平均0.89）。顶级模型准确率超过0.9，但案例分析显示推理质量和稳定性不一致，限制了可靠性。

Conclusion: ADRD-Bench填补了ADRD领域LLM评估的空白，虽然顶级模型表现良好，但推理质量和稳定性问题表明需要基于日常照护数据的领域特异性改进，以增强LLM的知识和推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential for healthcare applications. However, existing evaluation benchmarks provide minimal coverage of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). To address this gap, we introduce ADRD-Bench, the first ADRD-specific benchmark dataset designed for rigorous evaluation of LLMs. ADRD-Bench has two components: 1) ADRD Unified QA, a synthesis of 1,352 questions consolidated from seven established medical benchmarks, providing a unified assessment of clinical knowledge; and 2) ADRD Caregiving QA, a novel set of 149 questions derived from the Aging Brain Care (ABC) program, a widely used, evidence-based brain health management program. Guided by a program with national expertise in comprehensive ADRD care, this new set was designed to mitigate the lack of practical caregiving context in existing benchmarks. We evaluated 33 state-of-the-art LLMs on the proposed ADRD-Bench. Results showed that the accuracy of open-weight general models ranged from 0.63 to 0.93 (mean: 0.78; std: 0.09). The accuracy of open-weight medical models ranged from 0.48 to 0.93 (mean: 0.82; std: 0.13). The accuracy of closed-source general models ranged from 0.83 to 0.91 (mean: 0.89; std: 0.03). While top-tier models achieved high accuracies (>0.9), case studies revealed that inconsistent reasoning quality and stability limit their reliability, highlighting a critical need for domain-specific improvement to enhance LLMs' knowledge and reasoning grounded in daily caregiving data. The entire dataset is available at https://github.com/IIRL-ND/ADRD-Bench.

*Jayadev Billa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语音语言模型在音频与文本冲突时，会过度偏向文本（16.6% vs 文本间冲突的1.6%），这不是音频质量问题，而是模型推理中模态仲裁可访问性的不对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语音语言模型在音频和文本信息冲突时的行为模式，发现模型存在强烈的文本偏向性，即使音频质量更好且被明确指示信任音频。

Method: 使用ALME基准测试（57,602个受控音频-文本冲突刺激，覆盖8种语言），分析Gemini 2.0 Flash等四个最先进的音频-LLM。通过强制转录、文本标注为"故意损坏"、微调消融实验等方法探究文本主导性的机制。

Result: 音频-文本冲突下的文本主导性（16.6%）远高于文本-文本冲突（1.6%）。音频嵌入比文本转录保留更多信息（音频准确率97.2% vs 级联准确率93.9%）。文本主导性主要源于LLM推理过程而非音频编码器。

Conclusion: 文本主导性反映了模态仲裁可访问性的不对称性，而非信息内容差异。这是标准语音基准测试未捕捉到的可靠性维度，对多模态模型设计有重要启示。

Abstract: When audio and text conflict, speech-enabled language models follow the text 10 times more often than when arbitrating between two text sources, even when explicitly instructed to trust the audio. Using ALME, a benchmark of 57,602 controlled audio-text conflict stimuli across 8 languages, we find that Gemini 2.0 Flash exhibits 16.6\% text dominance under audio-text conflict versus 1.6\% under text-text conflict with identical reliability cues. This gap is not explained by audio quality: audio-only accuracy (97.2\%) exceeds cascade accuracy (93.9\%), indicating audio embeddings preserve more information than text transcripts. We propose that text dominance reflects an asymmetry not in information content but in arbitration accessibility: how easily the model can reason over competing representations.
  This framework explains otherwise puzzling findings. Forcing transcription before answering increases text dominance (19\% to 33\%), sacrificing audio's information advantage without improving accessibility. Framing text as ``deliberately corrupted'' reduces text dominance by 80\%. A fine-tuning ablation provides interventional evidence: training only the audio projection layer increases text dominance (+26.5\%), while LoRA on the language model halves it ($-$23.9\%), localizing text dominance to the LLM's reasoning rather than the audio encoder. Experiments across four state-of-the-art audio-LLMs and 8 languages show consistent trends with substantial cross-linguistic and cross-model variation, establishing modality arbitration as a distinct reliability dimension not captured by standard speech benchmarks.

TL;DR: MuRGAt是一个评估多模态大语言模型事实级归因能力的基准，要求模型在需要超越直接观察的推理任务中生成带有精确引用的答案，揭示当前模型在推理与可验证归因之间存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态归因评估方法局限于简化场景或有限模态，无法评估复杂多模态推理中的归因能力。现实任务需要模型将输出基于异构输入源并验证个体事实主张，因此需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 提出MuRGAt基准，要求模型处理视频、音频等多模态输入，生成带有显式推理和精确引用的答案，每个引用需指定模态和时间段。同时开发了与人类判断高度相关的自动评估框架。

Result: 评估发现，即使强大的多模态大语言模型也经常产生虚假引用，尽管推理正确。存在关键权衡：增加推理深度或强制结构化归因通常会降低准确性，揭示内部推理与可验证归因之间的显著差距。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中的归因能力存在不足，需要开发既能保持推理深度又能确保可验证引用的方法。MuRGAt为评估和改进多模态归因提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used for real-world tasks involving multi-step reasoning and long-form generation, where reliability requires grounding model outputs in heterogeneous input sources and verifying individual factual claims. However, existing multimodal grounding benchmarks and evaluation methods focus on simplified, observation-based scenarios or limited modalities and fail to assess attribution in complex multimodal reasoning. We introduce MuRGAt (Multimodal Reasoning with Grounded Attribution), a benchmark for evaluating fact-level multimodal attribution in settings that require reasoning beyond direct observation. Given inputs spanning video, audio, and other modalities, MuRGAt requires models to generate answers with explicit reasoning and precise citations, where each citation specifies both modality and temporal segments. To enable reliable assessment, we introduce an automatic evaluation framework that strongly correlates with human judgments. Benchmarking with human and automated scores reveals that even strong MLLMs frequently hallucinate citations despite correct reasoning. Moreover, we observe a key trade-off: increasing reasoning depth or enforcing structured grounding often degrades accuracy, highlighting a significant gap between internal reasoning and verifiable attribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM预训练需要集中式集群和大量高内存GPU，现有分散式方法仍需在每个节点训练完整模型，仍受GPU内存限制。需要一种能显著降低内存需求的分散式训练方案

Method: 提出SPES框架：1) 每个节点只训练专家子集，大幅降低内存占用；2) 节点更新本地专家并定期同步，避免全参数传输；3) 引入专家合并预热策略，在训练早期交换知识以加速收敛

Result: 使用16个48GB GPU在互联网连接下成功训练2B参数的MoE LLM，性能与集中式训练相当。进一步展示了可扩展性：从头训练7B模型和从密集检查点上采样9B模型，均匹配集中式基线

Conclusion: SPES提供了一种内存高效的分散式MoE LLM预训练方案，能在有限GPU资源下训练大规模模型，为资源受限环境下的LLM训练开辟了新途径

Abstract: Pretraining large language models (LLMs) typically requires centralized clusters with thousands of high-memory GPUs (e.g., H100/A100). Recent decentralized training methods reduce communication overhead by employing federated optimization; however, they still need to train the entire model on each node, remaining constrained by GPU memory limitations. In this work, we propose SParse Expert Synchronization (SPES), a memory-efficient decentralized framework for pretraining mixture-of-experts (MoE) LLMs. SPES trains only a subset of experts per node, substantially lowering the memory footprint. Each node updates its local experts and periodically synchronizes with other nodes, eliminating full-parameter transmission while ensuring efficient knowledge sharing. To accelerate convergence, we introduce an expert-merging warm-up strategy, where experts exchange knowledge early in training, to rapidly establish foundational capabilities. With SPES, we train a 2B-parameter MoE LLM using 16 standalone 48GB GPUs over internet connections, which achieves competitive performance with centrally trained LLMs under similar computational budgets. We further demonstrate scalability by training a 7B model from scratch and a 9B model upcycled from a dense checkpoint, both of which match prior centralized baselines.

TL;DR: SIGHT框架通过自证据支持和信息增益驱动的多样化分支，解决多轮搜索中冗余和噪声问题，提升LLM在复杂问答中的推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习赋能LLM进行自主搜索，但在多轮搜索场景中，搜索结果存在高冗余和低信噪比问题，导致代理陷入"隧道视野"——早期噪声检索的强制解释引发不可逆的错误累积

Method: 提出SIGHT框架：1) 通过自证据支持(SES)将搜索结果提炼为高保真证据；2) 计算信息增益分数识别关键状态；3) 动态提示干预(去重、反思、自适应分支)；4) 通过组相对策略优化整合SES和正确性奖励

Result: 在单跳和多跳QA基准测试中，SIGHT显著优于现有方法，特别是在复杂推理场景中，且使用更少的搜索步骤

Conclusion: SIGHT通过自证据支持和信息增益驱动的多样化分支，有效解决了多轮搜索中的冗余和噪声问题，使LLM能够学习稳健的探索策略，在复杂推理任务中表现优异

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to master autonomous search for complex question answering. However, particularly within multi-turn search scenarios, this interaction introduces a critical challenge: search results often suffer from high redundancy and low signal-to-noise ratios. Consequently, agents easily fall into "Tunnel Vision," where the forced interpretation of early noisy retrievals leads to irreversible error accumulation. To address these challenges, we propose SIGHT, a framework that enhances search-based reasoning through Self-Evidence Support (SES) and Information-Gain Driven Diverse Branching. SIGHT distills search results into high-fidelity evidence via SES and calculates an Information Gain score to pinpoint pivotal states where observations maximally reduce uncertainty. This score guides Dynamic Prompting Interventions - including de-duplication, reflection, or adaptive branching - to spawn new branches with SES. Finally, by integrating SES and correctness rewards via Group Relative Policy Optimization, SIGHT internalizes robust exploration strategies without external verifiers. Experiments on single-hop and multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SIGHT significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in complex reasoning scenarios, using fewer search steps.

TL;DR: PRIME是一个用于评估数学和工程领域过程-结果对齐验证的基准，包含2530个高难度STEM问题，发现当前验证器常忽略推导过程错误，并提出基于PRIME选择验证器的过程感知RLVR训练范式，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于模型的验证器主要关注最终结果与真实答案的一致性，而忽略了推导过程中的潜在错误，导致会给从错误推导中产生的正确答案分配正奖励。需要解决过程-结果对齐的验证问题。

Method: 1. 构建PRIME基准：从大学STEM问题中通过一致性过滤管道收集2530个高难度样本；2. 评估当前验证器在检测推导缺陷方面的表现；3. 提出基于PRIME选择的验证器的过程感知RLVR训练范式。

Result: 1. 当前验证器经常无法检测推导缺陷；2. 过程感知RLVR训练范式相比仅关注结果的验证基线显著提升性能：在AIME24、AIME25和Beyond-AIME上分别获得8.29%、9.12%和7.31%的绝对性能提升；3. PRIME验证器准确性与RLVR训练效果呈强线性相关（R² > 0.92）。

Conclusion: PRIME基准能有效评估过程-结果对齐验证，基于PRIME选择的验证器的过程感知RLVR训练范式能显著提升性能，且PRIME可作为验证器选择的可靠预测指标。

Abstract: While model-based verifiers are essential for scaling Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), current outcome-centric verification paradigms primarily focus on the consistency between the final result and the ground truth, often neglecting potential errors in the derivation process. This leads to assigning positive rewards to correct answers produced from incorrect derivations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PRIME, a benchmark for evaluating verifiers on Process-Outcome Alignment verification in Mathematics and Engineering. Curated from a comprehensive collection of college-level STEM problems, PRIME comprises 2,530 high-difficulty samples through a consistency-based filtering pipeline. Through extensive evaluation, we find that current verifiers frequently fail to detect derivation flaws. Furthermore, we propose a process-aware RLVR training paradigm utilizing verifiers selected via PRIME. This approach substantially outperforms the outcome-only verification baseline, achieving absolute performance gains of 8.29%, 9.12%, and 7.31% on AIME24, AIME25, and Beyond-AIME, respectively, for the Qwen3-14B-Base model. Finally, we demonstrate a strong linear correlation ($R^2 > 0.92$) between verifier accuracy on PRIME and RLVR training effectiveness, validating PRIME as a reliable predictor for verifier selection.

Conclusion: SAMD方法通过模拟人脑选择性注意机制，有效解决了LLM在记忆处理中的效率和过滤问题，为个性化应用中的知识组织提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Intelligent devices have become deeply integrated into everyday life, generating vast amounts of user interactions that form valuable personal knowledge. Efficient organization of this knowledge in user memory is essential for enabling personalized applications. However, current research on memory writing, management, and reading using large language models (LLMs) faces challenges in filtering irrelevant information and in dealing with rising computational costs. Inspired by the concept of selective attention in the human brain, we introduce a memory discrimination task. To address large-scale interactions and diverse memory standards in this task, we propose a Scene-Aware Memory Discrimination method (SAMD), which comprises two key components: the Gating Unit Module (GUM) and the Cluster Prompting Module (CPM). GUM enhances processing efficiency by filtering out non-memorable interactions and focusing on the salient content most relevant to application demands. CPM establishes adaptive memory standards, guiding LLMs to discern what information should be remembered or discarded. It also analyzes the relationship between user intents and memory contexts to build effective clustering prompts. Comprehensive direct and indirect evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our approach. We independently assess the performance of memory discrimination, showing that SAMD successfully recalls the majority of memorable data and remains robust in dynamic scenarios. Furthermore, when integrated into personalized applications, SAMD significantly enhances both the efficiency and quality of memory construction, leading to better organization of personal knowledge.

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B/7B)上的实验表明，该方法在数学基准测试中显著减少token使用（高达55.7%），同时提高准确性（高达4.1%），并能泛化到代码、科学和通用领域。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次压缩框架有效解决了语言推理模型的"过度思考"问题，实现了推理效率和质量的双重提升，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Language Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by scaling test-time computation but often suffer from ``overthinking'', producing excessively long reasoning traces that increase latency and memory usage. Existing LRMs typically enforce conciseness with uniform length penalties, which over-compress crucial early deduction steps at the sequence level and indiscriminately penalize all queries at the group level. To solve these limitations, we propose \textbf{\model}, a dual-level framework for prefix-protected and difficulty-aware compression under hierarchical supervision. At the sequence level, prefix-protected optimization employs decaying mixed rollouts to maintain valid reasoning paths while promoting conciseness. At the group level, difficulty-aware penalty dynamically scales length constraints based on query complexity, maintaining exploration for harder questions while curbing redundancy on easier ones. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen (1.5B/7B) demonstrate that \model achieves a substantial reduction in token usage (up to \textbf{55.7\%}) while simultaneously improving accuracy (up to \textbf{4.1\%}) on math benchmarks, with generalization ability to code, science, and general domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在教育反馈生成中显示出潜力，但特定反馈元素（如语气、信息覆盖）如何影响学习效果和学习者接受度尚不清楚，特别是对于不同人格特质的学习者

Method: 定义六个反馈元素，使用GPT-5为生物选择题生成反馈，对321名高一学生进行学习实验，评估两个学习效果指标和六个主观评价标准，分析大五人格特质对反馈接受度的影响

Result: 有效的反馈元素在支持学习效果方面有共同模式，但学习者的主观偏好因人格特质聚类而异

Conclusion: 设计LLM生成的反馈时，应根据学习者的人格特质选择和调整反馈元素，为教育中的个性化反馈设计提供实践启示

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automatically generating feedback in education settings. However, it remains unclear how specific feedback elements, such as tone and information coverage, contribute to learning outcomes and learner acceptance, particularly across learners with different personality traits. In this study, we define six feedback elements and generate feedback for multiple-choice biology questions using GPT-5. We conduct a learning experiment with 321 first-year high school students and evaluate feedback effectiveness using two learning outcomes measures and subjective evaluations across six criteria. We further analyze differences in how feedback acceptance varies across learners based on Big Five personality traits. Our results show that effective feedback elements share common patterns supporting learning outcomes, while learners' subjective preferences differ across personality-based clusters. These findings highlight the importance of selecting and adapting feedback elements according to learners' personality traits when we design LLM-generated feedback, and provide practical implications for personalized feedback design in education.

Conclusion: PatientHub通过标准化和模块化方法解决了模拟患者领域的碎片化问题，加速了方法开发，支持公平比较，并为该领域的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: As Large Language Models increasingly power role-playing applications, simulating patients has become a valuable tool for training counselors and scaling therapeutic assessment. However, prior work is fragmented: existing approaches rely on incompatible, non-standardized data formats, prompts, and evaluation metrics, hindering reproducibility and fair comparison. In this paper, we introduce PatientHub, a unified and modular framework that standardizes the definition, composition, and deployment of simulated patients. To demonstrate PatientHub's utility, we implement several representative patient simulation methods as case studies, showcasing how our framework supports standardized cross-method evaluation and the seamless integration of custom evaluation metrics. We further demonstrate PatientHub's extensibility by prototyping two new simulator variants, highlighting how PatientHub accelerates method development by eliminating infrastructure overhead. By consolidating existing work into a single reproducible pipeline, PatientHub lowers the barrier to developing new simulation methods and facilitates cross-method and cross-model benchmarking. Our framework provides a practical foundation for future datasets, methods, and benchmarks in patient-centered dialogue, and the code is publicly available via https://github.com/Sahandfer/PatientHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在区分"异常但可解释"与"真正无意义"句子方面存在不足，不清楚现有数据集的无意义程度，也不清楚LLM能否有效区分这两类句子

Method: 收集人类评分者和LLM对五个语义异常数据集中句子的可理解性判断，包括无上下文和有上下文两种情况

Result: 评分者认为大多数句子只是异常而非真正无意义；LLM在生成异常句子的合理上下文方面表现出色

Conclusion: 现有语义异常数据集主要包含异常而非无意义句子，LLM具备为异常句子生成合理上下文的能力，这对语义理解模型开发有重要意义

Abstract: Nonsensical and anomalous sentences have been instrumental in the development of computational models of semantic interpretation. A core challenge is to distinguish between what is merely anomalous (but can be interpreted given a supporting context) and what is truly nonsensical. However, it is unclear (a) how nonsensical, rather than merely anomalous, existing datasets are; and (b) how well LLMs can make this distinction. In this paper, we answer both questions by collecting sensicality judgments from human raters and LLMs on sentences from five semantically deviant datasets: both context-free and when providing a context. We find that raters consider most sentences at most anomalous, and only a few as properly nonsensical. We also show that LLMs are substantially skilled in generating plausible contexts for anomalous cases.

Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中存在精度悖论：视觉感知系统仅转录符号而不捕获逻辑拓扑，像素生成模型产生缺乏数学精确性的视觉伪影。需要弥合这一差距。

Method: 提出Thinking with Drafting (TwD)方法，基于"解析即推理"公理，使用极简领域特定语言(DSL)作为基础中间表示，强制模型将心理模型草拟为可执行代码，生成确定性视觉证明进行自我验证。

Result: 在VisAlg视觉代数基准测试中，TwD作为优越的认知支架，建立了一个闭环系统，其中视觉生成不是创造性输出而是逻辑验证器，为视觉推理提供了可泛化的路径。

Conclusion: TwD将视觉推理重新概念化为光学解压缩过程，通过DSL中间表示和代码草拟机制，解决了多模态模型在复杂推理中的精度问题，实现了精确的视觉代数推理和验证。

Abstract: Existing multimodal large language models have achieved high-fidelity visual perception and exploratory visual generation. However, a precision paradox persists in complex reasoning tasks: optical perception systems transcribe symbols without capturing logical topology, while pixel-based generative models produce visual artifacts lacking mathematical exactness. To bridge this gap, we propose that reasoning over visual inputs be reconceptualized as optical decompression-the process of reconstructing latent logical structures from compressed visual tokens. Guided by the axiom that Parsing is Reasoning, we introduce Thinking with Drafting (TwD), which utilizes a minimalist Domain-Specific Language (DSL) as a grounding intermediate representation. Unlike standard approaches that hallucinate answers directly, TwD forces the model to draft its mental model into executable code, rendering deterministic visual proofs for self-verification. To validate this, we present VisAlg, a visual algebra benchmark. Experiments demonstrate that TwD serve as a superior cognitive scaffold. Our work establishes a closed-loop system where visual generation acts not as a creative output but as a logical verifier, offering a generalizable path for visual reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在测试时扩展中存在"浅层探索陷阱"问题：虽然更广泛的状态覆盖需要更长的推理轨迹，但自回归生成中采样长序列的概率呈指数衰减，限制了模型在单一连续情境中生成、验证和优化多个推理假设的能力

Method: 提出Length-Incentivized Exploration方法：1) 使用基于长度的奖励明确鼓励模型进行更多探索；2) 结合冗余惩罚避免重复探索；3) 通过这种两步法最大化状态覆盖

Result: 在Qwen3、Llama等不同模型上的综合实验表明，该方法能有效激励情境探索，在领域内任务上平均提升4.4%，在领域外基准测试上获得2.7%的增益

Conclusion: Length-Incentivized Exploration通过简单而有效的设计解决了自回归生成中的浅层探索陷阱，显著提升了模型的情境探索能力，为测试时扩展提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Achieving effective test-time scaling requires models to engage in In-Context Exploration -- the intrinsic ability to generate, verify, and refine multiple reasoning hypotheses within a single continuous context.
  Grounded in State Coverage theory, our analysis identifies a critical bottleneck to enabling this capability: while broader state coverage requires longer reasoning trajectories, the probability of sampling such sequences decays exponentially during autoregressive generation, a phenomenon we term the ``Shallow Exploration Trap''.
  To bridge this gap, we propose Length-Incentivized Exploration(\method).
  This simple yet effective recipe explicitly encourages models to explore more via a length-based reward coupled with a redundancy penalty, thereby maximizing state coverage in two-step manner.
  Comprehensive experiments across different models (Qwen3, Llama) demonstrate that \method effectively incentivize in-context exploration.
  As a result, our method achieves an average improvement of 4.4\% on in-domain tasks and a 2.7\% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: MiniCPM-SALA是一个9B参数的混合注意力架构，结合了稀疏注意力的高保真长上下文建模和线性注意力的全局效率，在单GPU上支持高达100万token的上下文长度，推理速度比全注意力模型快3.5倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理超长上下文时面临Transformer架构的高计算和内存成本挑战。现有的稀疏和线性注意力机制通常需要在内存效率和模型性能之间做出权衡，需要一种既能保持性能又能提高效率的解决方案。

Method: 提出MiniCPM-SALA混合架构，集成InfLLM-V2稀疏注意力的高保真长上下文建模和Lightning Attention线性注意力的全局效率。采用层选择算法以1:3比例整合两种机制，使用混合位置编码(HyPE)，并提出经济高效的持续训练框架，将预训练的Transformer模型转换为混合模型。

Result: 在单张NVIDIA A6000D GPU上，模型在256K token序列长度下推理速度比全注意力模型快3.5倍，支持高达100万token的上下文长度（传统8B全注意力模型因内存限制无法处理）。训练成本比从头训练降低约75%，同时保持与全注意力模型相当的一般能力。

Conclusion: MiniCPM-SALA成功解决了长上下文处理中的效率-性能权衡问题，通过混合注意力架构实现了高效的长上下文建模，为实际应用中的超长序列处理提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The evolution of large language models (LLMs) towards applications with ultra-long contexts faces challenges posed by the high computational and memory costs of the Transformer architecture. While existing sparse and linear attention mechanisms attempt to mitigate these issues, they typically involve a trade-off between memory efficiency and model performance. This paper introduces MiniCPM-SALA, a 9B-parameter hybrid architecture that integrates the high-fidelity long-context modeling of sparse attention (InfLLM-V2) with the global efficiency of linear attention (Lightning Attention). By employing a layer selection algorithm to integrate these mechanisms in a 1:3 ratio and utilizing a hybrid positional encoding (HyPE), the model maintains efficiency and performance for long-context tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective continual training framework that transforms pre-trained Transformer-based models into hybrid models, which reduces training costs by approximately 75% compared to training from scratch. Extensive experiments show that MiniCPM-SALA maintains general capabilities comparable to full-attention models while offering improved efficiency. On a single NVIDIA A6000D GPU, the model achieves up to 3.5x the inference speed of the full-attention model at the sequence length of 256K tokens and supports context lengths of up to 1M tokens, a scale where traditional full-attention 8B models fail because of memory constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预归一化或预定义变体列表处理语言变异，将拼写和形态多样性视为噪声，难以在低资源或多语言环境中有效分析语言变异模式

Method: 在原始文本上训练子词嵌入，结合余弦相似度和n-gram相似度对相关形式进行分组聚类，形成变异家族，支持定量和定性分析

Result: 在卢森堡语用户评论语料库中发现大量词汇和正字法变异，与方言和社会语言学研究描述的模式一致，诱导出的变异家族捕捉了系统性对应关系，突出了区域和风格差异

Conclusion: 分布建模即使在"嘈杂"或低资源环境中也能揭示有意义的变异模式，为研究多语言和小语言环境中的语言多样性提供了可复现的方法框架

Abstract: This paper presents an embedding-based approach to detecting variation without relying on prior normalisation or predefined variant lists. The method trains subword embeddings on raw text and groups related forms through combined cosine and n-gram similarity. This allows spelling and morphological diversity to be examined and analysed as linguistic structure rather than treated as noise. Using a large corpus of Luxembourgish user comments, the approach uncovers extensive lexical and orthographic variation that aligns with patterns described in dialectal and sociolinguistic research. The induced families capture systematic correspondences and highlight areas of regional and stylistic differentiation. The procedure does not strictly require manual annotation, but does produce transparent clusters that support both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The results demonstrate that distributional modelling can reveal meaningful patterns of variation even in ''noisy'' or low-resource settings, offering a reproducible methodological framework for studying language variety in multilingual and small-language contexts.

Motivation: 现有基于困惑度等指标的方法无法充分捕捉上下文信息，需要一种能同时编码排名和概率信息的统一表示方法。

Method: 提出DMAP方法，将文本通过语言模型映射到单位区间的一组样本，这些样本联合编码了排名和概率信息，支持模型无关分析。

Result: 通过三个案例研究验证DMAP的实用性：1）生成参数验证；2）概率曲率在机器生成文本检测中的作用；3）后训练合成数据留下的统计指纹分析。

Conclusion: DMAP为文本分析提供了统一的统计视角，计算简单、适用广泛，为基于LLM的文本分析研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful tool for statistical text analysis, with derived sequences of next-token probability distributions offering a wealth of information. Extracting this signal typically relies on metrics such as perplexity, which do not adequately account for context; how one should interpret a given next-token probability is dependent on the number of reasonable choices encoded by the shape of the conditional distribution. In this work, we present DMAP, a mathematically grounded method that maps a text, via a language model, to a set of samples in the unit interval that jointly encode rank and probability information. This representation enables efficient, model-agnostic analysis and supports a range of applications. We illustrate its utility through three case studies: (i) validation of generation parameters to ensure data integrity, (ii) examining the role of probability curvature in machine-generated text detection, and (iii) a forensic analysis revealing statistical fingerprints left in downstream models that have been subject to post-training on synthetic data. Our results demonstrate that DMAP offers a unified statistical view of text that is simple to compute on consumer hardware, widely applicable, and provides a foundation for further research into text analysis with LLMs.

Method: 提出RouterXBench评估框架（三个维度：路由能力、场景对齐、跨域鲁棒性），并设计ProbeDirichlet路由器，利用内部隐藏状态和可学习的狄利克雷分布进行概率训练

Result: ProbeDirichlet在路由能力和高精度场景中相对最佳基线分别提升16.68%和18.86%，在不同模型家族、规模、异构任务和智能体工作流中表现一致

Conclusion: 基于隐藏状态的路由方法优于传统概率或嵌入方法，ProbeDirichlet在系统评估框架下展现出优越的跨域鲁棒性和实际部署价值

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved success, but cost and privacy constraints necessitate deploying smaller models locally while offloading complex queries to cloud-based models. Existing router evaluations are unsystematic, overlooking scenario-specific requirements and out-of-distribution robustness. We propose RouterXBench, a principled evaluation framework with three dimensions: router ability, scenario alignment, and cross-domain robustness. Unlike prior work that relies on output probabilities or external embeddings, we utilize internal hidden states that capture model uncertainty before answer generation. We introduce ProbeDirichlet, a lightweight router that aggregates cross-layer hidden states via learnable Dirichlet distributions with probabilistic training. Trained on multi-domain data, it generalizes robustly across in-domain and out-of-distribution scenarios. Our results show ProbeDirichlet achieves 16.68% and 18.86% relative improvements over the best baselines in router ability and high-accuracy scenarios, with consistent performance across model families, model scales, heterogeneous tasks, and agentic workflows.

Motivation: 公司财务报告是构建知识图谱的宝贵结构化知识来源，但该领域缺乏标注的真实数据，使得评估变得困难。需要开发不依赖人工标注的评估方法。

Method: 提出半自动化的主谓宾三元组抽取流程，使用本体一致性（Ontology Conformance）和忠实度（Faithfulness）作为代理评估指标。比较静态手动构建本体与全自动文档特定本体归纳方法，并采用结合正则匹配和LLM作为评判的混合验证策略。

Result: 自动归纳的本体在所有配置中实现100%模式一致性，消除了手动方法中观察到的本体漂移。混合验证策略将明显的主语幻觉率从65.2%降至1.6%。识别出主语和宾语幻觉之间的系统性不对称，归因于财务文本中的被动结构和省略施事者。

Conclusion: 本体驱动的代理指标可以替代基于真实数据的评估，自动本体归纳优于手动工程化本体，混合验证策略能有效减少幻觉，财务文本的语言特征导致主语和宾语幻觉存在系统性差异。

Abstract: Corporate financial reports are a valuable source of structured knowledge for Knowledge Graph construction, but the lack of annotated ground truth in this domain makes evaluation difficult. We present a semi-automated pipeline for Subject-Predicate-Object triplet extraction that uses ontology-driven proxy metrics, specifically Ontology Conformance and Faithfulness, instead of ground-truth-based evaluation. We compare a static, manually engineered ontology against a fully automated, document-specific ontology induction approach across different LLMs and two corporate annual reports. The automatically induced ontology achieves 100% schema conformance in all configurations, eliminating the ontology drift observed with the manual approach. We also propose a hybrid verification strategy that combines regex matching with an LLM-as-a-judge check, reducing apparent subject hallucination rates from 65.2% to 1.6% by filtering false positives caused by coreference resolution. Finally, we identify a systematic asymmetry between subject and object hallucinations, which we attribute to passive constructions and omitted agents in financial prose.

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注LLMs在基准测试上的准确率提升，但忽视了即使准确率相近的模型在实际判断上可能存在显著分歧，这可能影响科学研究的可重复性。

Method: 使用MMLU-Pro和GPQA两个主要推理基准，分析不同LLMs在相同准确率下的具体判断分歧；重新分析已发表的教育和政治科学研究，考察更换标注模型对研究结果的影响。

Result: LLMs在16-66%的项目上存在分歧，前沿模型之间也有16-38%的分歧；在重新分析的研究中，更换标注模型可使估计的治疗效应变化超过80%，有时甚至改变效应方向。

Conclusion: 基准测试存在"基准幻觉"，即相同的准确率可能掩盖模型间的深层分歧，模型选择成为影响科学研究可重复性的隐藏但关键变量。

Abstract: Benchmarks underpin how progress in large language models (LLMs) is measured and trusted. Yet our analyses reveal that apparent convergence in benchmark accuracy can conceal deep epistemic divergence. Using two major reasoning benchmarks - MMLU-Pro and GPQA - we show that LLMs achieving comparable accuracy still disagree on 16-66% of items, and 16-38% among top-performing frontier models. These discrepancies suggest distinct error profiles for different LLMs. When such models are used for scientific data annotation and inference, their hidden disagreements propagate into research results: in re-analyses of published studies in education and political science, switching the annotation model can change estimated treatment effects by more than 80%, and in some cases reverses their sign. Together, these findings illustrate a benchmark illusion, where equal accuracy may conceal disagreement, with model choice becoming a hidden yet consequential variable for scientific reproducibility.

Conclusion: AdaptEvolve通过动态选择足够能力且计算高效的LLM，有效解决了进化式智能体系统中计算效率与推理能力的权衡问题

Abstract: Evolutionary agentic systems intensify the trade-off between computational efficiency and reasoning capability by repeatedly invoking large language models (LLMs) during inference. This setting raises a central question: how can an agent dynamically select an LLM that is sufficiently capable for the current generation step while remaining computationally efficient? While model cascades offer a practical mechanism for balancing this trade-off, existing routing strategies typically rely on static heuristics or external controllers and do not explicitly account for model uncertainty. We introduce AdaptEvolve: Adaptive LLM Selection for Multi-LLM Evolutionary Refinement within an evolutionary sequential refinement framework that leverages intrinsic generation confidence to estimate real-time solvability. Empirical results show that confidence-driven selection yields a favourable Pareto frontier, reducing total inference cost by an average of 37.9% across benchmarks while retaining 97.5% of the upper-bound accuracy of static large-model baselines.

Conclusion: CMRT框架有效解决了端到端语音翻译模型的形态学鲁棒性问题，无需昂贵的对抗语音数据生成，为实际应用中的鲁棒语音翻译提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) has seen significant advancements, yet current models are primarily benchmarked on curated, "clean" datasets. This overlooks critical real-world challenges, such as morphological robustness to inflectional variations common in non-native or dialectal speech. In this work, we adapt a text-based adversarial attack targeting inflectional morphology to the speech domain and demonstrate that state-of-the-art E2E-ST models are highly vulnerable it. While adversarial training effectively mitigates such risks in text-based tasks, generating high-quality adversarial speech data remains computationally expensive and technically challenging. To address this, we propose Cross-Modal Robustness Transfer (CMRT), a framework that transfers adversarial robustness from the text modality to the speech modality. Our method eliminates the requirement for adversarial speech data during training. Extensive experiments across four language pairs demonstrate that CMRT improves adversarial robustness by an average of more than 3 BLEU points, establishing a new baseline for robust E2E-ST without the overhead of generating adversarial speech.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在定义明确的问题上表现良好，但标准QA基准测试仍未完全解决。作者认为这种差距部分源于定义不清的问题——那些没有额外上下文就无法唯一确定解释的查询。

Method: 引入基于LLM的分类器来识别定义不清的问题，应用于多个广泛使用的QA数据集；进行受控重写实验，将定义不清的问题重写为完全定义的变体，同时保持正确答案不变。

Result: 在基准测试中，16%到超过50%的问题存在定义不清；LLM在这些问题上的表现显著更差；在受控重写设置下，QA性能持续改善，表明许多明显的QA失败源于问题定义不清而非模型限制。

Conclusion: 定义不清是QA评估中的重要混淆因素，需要在基准设计中更加关注问题清晰度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform well on well-posed questions, yet standard question-answering (QA) benchmarks remain far from solved. We argue that this gap is partly due to underspecified questions - queries whose interpretation cannot be uniquely determined without additional context. To test this hypothesis, we introduce an LLM-based classifier to identify underspecified questions and apply it to several widely used QA datasets, finding that 16% to over 50% of benchmark questions are underspecified and that LLMs perform significantly worse on them. To isolate the effect of underspecification, we conduct a controlled rewriting experiment that serves as an upper-bound analysis, rewriting underspecified questions into fully specified variants while holding gold answers fixed. QA performance consistently improves under this setting, indicating that many apparent QA failures stem from question underspecification rather than model limitations. Our findings highlight underspecification as an important confound in QA evaluation and motivate greater attention to question clarity in benchmark design.

*Elisa Bassignana,Mike Zhang,Dirk Hovy,Amanda Cercas Curry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs对社交媒体中不同社会经济地位群体的语言风格适应能力有限，主要模仿上层SES风格，可能加剧语言不平等


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在不同社会语境下的语言适应能力，因为如果模型无法适应多样化的语言风格，可能会强化刻板印象、边缘化某些社区，并加剧社会分层

Method: 从Reddit和YouTube收集按社会经济地位分层的语料库，用四个LLMs补全不完整文本，将模型生成结果与原始文本在94个社会语言学指标上进行比较

Result: LLMs仅能轻微适应不同SES的语言风格，常表现为近似或夸张模仿，且更擅长模仿上层SES风格

Conclusion: LLMs可能加剧语言等级分化，对其在基于代理的社会模拟、调查实验等依赖语言风格作为社会信号的研究中的有效性提出质疑

Abstract: Humans adjust their linguistic style to the audience they are addressing. However, the extent to which LLMs adapt to different social contexts is largely unknown. As these models increasingly mediate human-to-human communication, their failure to adapt to diverse styles can perpetuate stereotypes and marginalize communities whose linguistic norms are less closely mirrored by the models, thereby reinforcing social stratification. We study the extent to which LLMs integrate into social media communication across different socioeconomic status (SES) communities. We collect a novel dataset from Reddit and YouTube, stratified by SES. We prompt four LLMs with incomplete text from that corpus and compare the LLM-generated completions to the originals along 94 sociolinguistic metrics, including syntactic, rhetorical, and lexical features. LLMs modulate their style with respect to SES to only a minor extent, often resulting in approximation or caricature, and tend to emulate the style of upper SES more effectively. Our findings (1) show how LLMs risk amplifying linguistic hierarchies and (2) call into question their validity for agent-based social simulation, survey experiments, and any research relying on language style as a social signal.

Abstract: Open large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated improving multilingual capabilities in recent years. In this paper, we present a study of open LLMs for multilingual machine translation (MT) across a range of languages, and investigate the effects of model scaling and data scaling when adapting open LLMs to multilingual MT through continual pretraining and instruction finetuning. Based on the Gemma3 model family, we develop MiLMMT-46, which achieves top-tier multilingual translation performance across 46 languages. Extensive experiments show that MiLMMT-46 consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, including Seed-X, HY-MT-1.5, and TranslateGemma, and achieves competitive performance with strong proprietary systems such as Google Translate and Gemini 3 Pro.

TL;DR: DHPLT是一个包含41种语言的历时语料库开放集合，基于HPLT网络爬取数据，利用时间戳划分三个时期（2011-2015、2020-2021、2024至今），提供预计算的词嵌入和词汇替换，填补多语言历时语义变化建模的资源空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏多语言的历时语料库资源，特别是针对语义变化建模的研究。现有资源主要集中在少数高资源语言，限制了跨语言历时语义研究的广度和深度。

Method: 基于HPLT网络爬取数据集，利用网页爬取时间戳作为文档创建时间的近似信号。构建三个时间段的语料库（每个语言每个时期100万文档），并提供预计算的词类型和词符嵌入以及目标词的词汇替换。

Result: 创建了包含41种语言的历时语料库集合，覆盖三个时间时期，提供预计算的语言特征。所有资源已公开可用，按语言分类，为多语言历时语义变化研究提供了基础数据支持。

Conclusion: DHPLT填补了多语言历时语料库的空白，为语义变化建模研究开辟了新的实验可能性，促进了跨语言历时语义研究的发展。

Abstract: In this resource paper, we present DHPLT, an open collection of diachronic corpora in 41 diverse languages. DHPLT is based on the web-crawled HPLT datasets; we use web crawl timestamps as the approximate signal of document creation time. The collection covers three time periods: 2011-2015, 2020-2021 and 2024-present (1 million documents per time period for each language). We additionally provide pre-computed word type and token embeddings and lexical substitutions for our chosen target words, while at the same time leaving it open for the other researchers to come up with their own target words using the same datasets. DHPLT aims at filling in the current lack of multilingual diachronic corpora for semantic change modelling (beyond a dozen of high-resource languages). It opens the way for a variety of new experimental setups in this field.

TL;DR: 研究探索使用大语言模型自动简化网络安全漏洞描述，发现现成模型虽能让文本看似更简单，但难以保持原意准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络安全信息对非专业人士难以理解，自动文本简化在医疗、科学等领域已有研究，但在快速变化且复杂的网络安全领域尚未探索。研究旨在利用LLMs简化CVE描述，提高可理解性。

Method: 创建网络安全ATS基线，构建包含40个CVE描述的测试数据集，由两组网络安全专家进行两轮调查评估，分析现成LLMs在文本简化中的表现。

Result: 现成LLMs能让文本表面看起来更简单，但在保持原意方面存在困难，即简化过程中容易丢失或改变原始漏洞描述的关键技术含义。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs在网络安全文本简化方面有潜力，但现成模型在意义保持方面存在局限，需要进一步研究改进，特别是在技术准确性要求高的领域。

Abstract: Understanding cyber security is increasingly important for individuals and organizations. However, a lot of information related to cyber security can be difficult to understand to those not familiar with the topic. In this study, we focus on investigating how large language models (LLMs) could be utilized in automatic text simplification (ATS) of Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) descriptions. Automatic text simplification has been studied in several contexts, such as medical, scientific, and news texts, but it has not yet been studied to simplify texts in the rapidly changing and complex domain of cyber security. We created a baseline for cyber security ATS and a test dataset of 40 CVE descriptions, evaluated by two groups of cyber security experts in two survey rounds. We have found that while out-of-the box LLMs can make the text appear simpler, they struggle with meaning preservation.

TL;DR: 提出LaCy预训练方法，让小语言模型学会区分哪些token应该自己预测，哪些应该通过<CALL>委托给外部资源，以提高事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型参数容量有限，容易产生事实错误。虽然可以通过访问外部资源（如大模型、文档、数据库）来缓解，但需要解决一个根本问题：哪些token应该让小模型在预训练中学习，哪些应该通过<CALL>委托给外部资源。

Method: 提出LaCy预训练方法，使用spaCy语法解析器增强损失信号，帮助小模型决定哪些token应该委托以防止事实错误，哪些即使损失较高也可以安全学习和预测。

Result: LaCy模型成功学会了哪些token应该自己预测，哪些应该委托求助。在与大模型级联生成时获得更高的FactScore，优于Rho或LLM-judge训练的小模型，同时更简单、更便宜。

Conclusion: 通过LaCy方法，小语言模型能够智能地决定何时自己预测、何时委托给外部资源，有效提高事实准确性，同时保持简单和成本效益。

Abstract: Language models have consistently grown to compress more world knowledge into their parameters, but the knowledge that can be pretrained into them is upper-bounded by their parameter size. Especially the capacity of Small Language Models (SLMs) is limited, leading to factually incorrect generations. This problem is often mitigated by giving the SLM access to an outside source: the ability to query a larger model, documents, or a database. Under this setting, we study the fundamental question of \emph{which tokens an SLM can and should learn} during pretraining, versus \emph{which ones it should delegate} via a \texttt{<CALL>} token. We find that this is not simply a question of loss: although the loss is predictive of whether a predicted token mismatches the ground-truth, some tokens are \emph{acceptable} in that they are truthful alternative continuations of a pretraining document, and should not trigger a \texttt{<CALL>} even if their loss is high. We find that a spaCy grammar parser can help augment the loss signal to decide which tokens the SLM should learn to delegate to prevent factual errors and which are safe to learn and predict even under high losses. We propose LaCy, a novel pretraining method based on this token selection philosophy. Our experiments demonstrate that LaCy models successfully learn which tokens to predict and where to delegate for help. This results in higher FactScores when generating in a cascade with a bigger model and outperforms Rho or LLM-judge trained SLMs, while being simpler and cheaper.

TL;DR: CLUES框架将临床Text-to-SQL的语义不确定性分解为歧义性和不稳定性两个分数，通过二分语义图矩阵的Schur补计算不稳定性，能有效预测失败并指导针对性干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床Text-to-SQL部署中，需要区分输出多样性的两种不同原因：需要澄清的输入歧义性和需要人工审查的模型不稳定性，但现有方法无法提供这种诊断性分解。

Method: 提出CLUES框架，将Text-to-SQL建模为两阶段过程（解释→答案），通过二分语义图矩阵的Schur补计算不稳定性分数，同时计算歧义性分数，将语义不确定性分解为两个诊断性指标。

Result: 在AmbigQA/SituatedQA（黄金解释）和临床Text-to-SQL基准测试中，CLUES在失败预测上优于最先进的核语言熵方法。高歧义/高不稳定性区域包含51%的错误，仅覆盖25%的查询，实现高效分流。

Conclusion: CLUES框架能有效分解语义不确定性为歧义性和不稳定性，提供诊断性分解，指导针对性干预（歧义性触发查询优化，不稳定性触发模型改进），提高临床Text-to-SQL部署的可靠性。

Abstract: Deploying large language models for clinical Text-to-SQL requires distinguishing two qualitatively different causes of output diversity: (i) input ambiguity that should trigger clarification, and (ii) model instability that should trigger human review. We propose CLUES, a framework that models Text-to-SQL as a two-stage process (interpretations --> answers) and decomposes semantic uncertainty into an ambiguity score and an instability score. The instability score is computed via the Schur complement of a bipartite semantic graph matrix. Across AmbigQA/SituatedQA (gold interpretations) and a clinical Text-to-SQL benchmark (known interpretations), CLUES improves failure prediction over state-of-the-art Kernel Language Entropy. In deployment settings, it remains competitive while providing a diagnostic decomposition unavailable from a single score. The resulting uncertainty regimes map to targeted interventions - query refinement for ambiguity, model improvement for instability. The high-ambiguity/high-instability regime contains 51% of errors while covering 25% of queries, enabling efficient triage.

Motivation: 大规模可验证提示成本高且包含大量无信息样本，现有方法关注通过率为0的困难提示，但通过率为1的简单提示在训练中增多，降低了有效数据规模

Method: 提出Composition-RL方法，自动组合多个问题形成新的可验证问题，将这些组合提示用于RL训练；还设计了课程学习变体，逐步增加组合深度

Result: 在4B到30B模型规模的广泛实验中，Composition-RL相比原始数据集训练的RL持续提升推理能力；课程变体进一步提升性能；还能实现更有效的跨领域RL

Conclusion: Composition-RL是一种简单有效的方法，能更好地利用有限的可验证提示，特别是针对通过率为1的提示，提升RLVR训练效率和模型推理能力

Abstract: Large-scale verifiable prompts underpin the success of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), but they contain many uninformative examples and are costly to expand further. Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型和多模态大语言模型的安全工作流程中，评估、诊断和对齐通常由不同工具处理。安全评估只能定位外部行为风险而无法找出内部根本原因，安全诊断往往偏离具体风险场景停留在可解释层面，安全对齐缺乏对内部机制变化的专门解释，可能降低通用能力。

Method: 提出开源项目DeepSight，包含评估工具包DeepSafe和诊断工具包DeepScan。通过统一任务和数据协议，在两个阶段之间建立连接，将安全评估从黑盒转变为白盒洞察。这是首个支持前沿AI风险评估以及联合安全评估与诊断的开源工具包。

Result: DeepSight是一个低成本、可复现、高效且高度可扩展的大规模模型安全评估项目，实现了安全评估与诊断的集成范式。

Conclusion: DeepSight通过统一的评估-诊断集成范式，系统解决了当前大模型安全工作中评估、诊断和对齐分离的问题，提供了从黑盒到白盒的安全洞察能力。

Abstract: As the development of Large Models (LMs) progresses rapidly, their safety is also a priority. In current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) safety workflow, evaluation, diagnosis, and alignment are often handled by separate tools. Specifically, safety evaluation can only locate external behavioral risks but cannot figure out internal root causes. Meanwhile, safety diagnosis often drifts from concrete risk scenarios and remains at the explainable level. In this way, safety alignment lack dedicated explanations of changes in internal mechanisms, potentially degrading general capabilities. To systematically address these issues, we propose an open-source project, namely DeepSight, to practice a new safety evaluation-diagnosis integrated paradigm. DeepSight is low-cost, reproducible, efficient, and highly scalable large-scale model safety evaluation project consisting of a evaluation toolkit DeepSafe and a diagnosis toolkit DeepScan. By unifying task and data protocols, we build a connection between the two stages and transform safety evaluation from black-box to white-box insight. Besides, DeepSight is the first open source toolkit that support the frontier AI risk evaluation and joint safety evaluation and diagnosis.

TL;DR: P-GenRM：首个个性化生成奖励模型，通过测试时用户缩放机制，将偏好信号转化为结构化评估链，并引入用户原型聚类和双粒度缩放，显著提升个性化对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化奖励模型存在两个主要局限：1）将多样化的场景特定偏好过度简化为固定的小规模评估原则；2）对反馈有限的新用户泛化能力不足。需要更灵活、可泛化的个性化奖励建模方法。

Method: 提出P-GenRM模型，将偏好信号转化为结构化评估链，生成自适应角色和评分标准。通过用户原型聚类，引入双粒度缩放机制：个体层面自适应缩放聚合用户评分方案；原型层面整合相似用户偏好。测试时用户缩放机制增强个性化对齐。

Result: 在广泛使用的个性化奖励模型基准上达到SOTA，平均提升2.31%。在分布外数据集上表现出强泛化能力。测试时用户缩放机制额外提供3%的性能提升，展示了更强的个性化对齐和测试时扩展性。

Conclusion: P-GenRM通过结构化评估链和双粒度缩放机制，有效解决了现有个性化奖励模型的局限性，在个性化对齐和泛化能力方面取得了显著改进，为大规模语言模型的个性化适配提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized alignment of large language models seeks to adapt responses to individual user preferences, typically via reinforcement learning. A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前流行的神经网络模型需要大量训练数据，而盖尔语等低资源语言缺乏足够数据。需要一种能有效利用有限样本数据的方法来支持这些语言的持续活力。

Method: 使用维基词典数据构建基于规则的盖尔语形态学模型。采用SQL查询不同词汇模式的出现情况，并开发声明式规则库，使Python工具能够推导盖尔语单词的屈折形式。

Result: 创建了一个功能性的规则系统，能够从维基词典数据中提取形态学模式并生成屈折形式。该方法为维基词典数据增加了新价值，使其适应教育工具和规则依赖解析器等新用例。

Conclusion: 基于规则的系统能有效利用低资源语言的有限数据，提供更好的可解释性，并支持教学材料设计。这种方法为支持盖尔语等低资源语言的工具开发提供了实用途径。

Abstract: Language models and software tools are essential to support the continuing vitality of lesser-used languages; however, currently popular neural models require considerable data for training, which normally is not available for such low-resource languages. This paper describes work-in-progress to construct a rule-based model of Gaidhlig morphology using data from Wiktionary, arguing that rule-based systems effectively leverage limited sample data, support greater interpretability, and provide insights useful in the design of teaching materials. The use of SQL for querying the occurrence of different lexical patterns is investigated, and a declarative rule-base is presented that allows Python utilities to derive inflected forms of Gaidhlig words. This functionality could be used to support educational tools that teach or explain language patterns, for example, or to support higher level tools such as rule-based dependency parsers. This approach adds value to the data already present in Wiktionary by adapting it to new use-cases.

Motivation: 当前语音对话模型的评估主要遵循文本生成标准，忽视了副语言特征、口语化表达以及现代智能体所需的认知深度。随着推理能力在语音对话模型中的快速集成，迫切需要能够应对现实世界复杂性的基准测试。

Method: 提出了WavBench基准测试，采用三方框架：1) 专业子集：显著提高难度，严格挑战推理增强模型；2) 基础子集：定义口语化新标准，强调"可听性"而非严格的书面准确性；3) 声学子集：涵盖显式理解、生成和隐式对话，在真实场景中全面评估副语言能力。

Result: 通过评估五个最先进的模型，WavBench为复杂问题解决、口语化表达和副语言保真度的交叉领域提供了关键见解，指导鲁棒语音对话模型的发展。

Conclusion: WavBench填补了当前语音对话评估的空白，提供了一个全面的基准测试框架，能够更好地评估真实世界对话能力，促进语音对话模型的演进。

Abstract: With the rapid integration of advanced reasoning capabilities into spoken dialogue models, the field urgently demands benchmarks that transcend simple interactions to address real-world complexity. However, current evaluations predominantly adhere to text-generation standards, overlooking the unique audio-centric characteristics of paralinguistics and colloquialisms, alongside the cognitive depth required by modern agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce WavBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate realistic conversational abilities where prior works fall short. Uniquely, WavBench establishes a tripartite framework: 1) Pro subset, designed to rigorously challenge reasoning-enhanced models with significantly increased difficulty; 2) Basic subset, defining a novel standard for spoken colloquialism that prioritizes "listenability" through natural vocabulary, linguistic fluency, and interactive rapport, rather than rigid written accuracy; and 3) Acoustic subset, covering explicit understanding, generation, and implicit dialogue to rigorously evaluate comprehensive paralinguistic capabilities within authentic real-world scenarios. Through evaluating five state-of-the-art models, WavBench offers critical insights into the intersection of complex problem-solving, colloquial delivery, and paralinguistic fidelity, guiding the evolution of robust spoken dialogue models. The benchmark dataset and evaluation toolkit are available at https://naruto-2024.github.io/wavbench.github.io/.

TL;DR: CitiLink-Minutes是一个包含120份欧洲葡萄牙语市政会议记录的多层标注数据集，包含超过100万个词元、38,000个标注，用于促进市政决策的NLP和IR研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 市政会议记录作为地方治理的重要文件，直接影响公民日常生活，但在信息检索和自然语言处理领域缺乏关注，主要原因是缺乏标注数据集，限制了计算模型的发展。

Method: 收集了6个城市的120份欧洲葡萄牙语市政会议记录，进行多层标注：包括元数据、讨论主题和投票结果三个维度。所有个人标识符都经过脱敏处理，每份记录由两名训练有素的标注员手动标注，并由经验丰富的语言学家审核。

Result: 创建了CitiLink-Minutes数据集，包含超过100万个词元、38,000个标注，遵循FAIR原则发布，并提供了元数据提取、主题分类和投票标签的基线结果。

Conclusion: CitiLink-Minutes填补了市政会议记录标注数据集的空白，展示了在下游NLP和IR任务中的潜力，同时促进了市政决策的透明访问。

Abstract: City councils play a crucial role in local governance, directly influencing citizens' daily lives through decisions made during municipal meetings. These deliberations are formally documented in meeting minutes, which serve as official records of discussions, decisions, and voting outcomes. Despite their importance, municipal meeting records have received little attention in Information Retrieval (IR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP), largely due to the lack of annotated datasets, which ultimately limit the development of computational models. To address this gap, we introduce CitiLink-Minutes, a multilayer dataset of 120 European Portuguese municipal meeting minutes from six municipalities. Unlike prior annotated datasets of parliamentary or video records, CitiLink-Minutes provides multilayer annotations and structured linkage of official written minutes. The dataset contains over one million tokens, with all personal identifiers de-identified. Each minute was manually annotated by two trained annotators and curated by an experienced linguist across three complementary dimensions: (1) metadata, (2) subjects of discussion, and (3) voting outcomes, totaling over 38,000 individual annotations. Released under FAIR principles and accompanied by baseline results on metadata extraction, topic classification, and vote labeling, CitiLink-Minutes demonstrates its potential for downstream NLP and IR tasks, while promoting transparent access to municipal decisions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: dVoting是一种针对扩散大语言模型的快速投票技术，通过并行采样和一致性分析识别不确定token，然后通过投票机制进行迭代优化，显著提升推理能力而无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型具有并行生成任意位置token的能力，但在多样本推理中存在token预测一致性高但性能受少数不确定token影响的问题。传统自回归模型在并行测试时扩展效率低下，需要一种能利用dLLMs并行生成优势的推理增强方法。

Method: dVoting采用迭代优化流程：1) 对同一提示进行多次采样；2) 通过一致性分析识别不确定token；3) 利用dLLMs的任意位置生成能力，通过投票机制重新生成不确定token；4) 重复此过程直至收敛。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著提升：GSM8K提升6.22%-7.66%，MATH500提升4.40%-7.20%，ARC-C提升3.16%-14.84%，MMLU提升4.83%-5.74%。

Conclusion: dVoting有效利用扩散大语言模型的并行生成能力，通过投票机制提升推理性能，仅需可接受的计算开销，为dLLMs的推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) represent a new paradigm beyond autoregressive modeling, offering competitive performance while naturally enabling a flexible decoding process. Specifically, dLLMs can generate tokens at arbitrary positions in parallel, endowing them with significant potential for parallel test-time scaling, which was previously constrained by severe inefficiency in autoregressive modeling. In this work, we introduce dVoting, a fast voting technique that boosts reasoning capability without training, with only an acceptable extra computational overhead. dVoting is motivated by the observation that, across multiple samples for the same prompt, token predictions remain largely consistent, whereas performance is determined by a small subset of tokens exhibiting cross-sample variability. Leveraging the arbitrary-position generation capability of dLLMs, dVoting performs iterative refinement by sampling, identifying uncertain tokens via consistency analysis, regenerating them through voting, and repeating this process until convergence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that dVoting consistently improves performance across various benchmarks. It achieves gains of 6.22%-7.66% on GSM8K, 4.40%-7.20% on MATH500, 3.16%-14.84% on ARC-C, and 4.83%-5.74% on MMLU. Our code is available at https://github.com/fscdc/dVoting

Motivation: 现有检索头分析基础上，需要更有效的重排序方法，能够利用候选列表整体信息进行排序，同时避免对Likert评分监督的依赖。

Method: 训练模型使用选定注意力头的注意力分数估计查询-段落相关性，提供列表式解决方案，利用整个候选短列表的全局信息进行排序。

Result: 在多个领域（包括Wikipedia和长篇叙事数据集）超越现有SOTA点式和列表式重排序器，在LoCoMo基准测试中建立新SOTA，支持灵活扩展。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级重排序框架有效且灵活，仅需小规模模型即可实现强大性能，支持上下文增强和中间层注意力头训练等扩展。

Abstract: Built upon the existing analysis of retrieval heads in large language models, we propose an alternative reranking framework that trains models to estimate passage-query relevance using the attention scores of selected heads. This approach provides a listwise solution that leverages holistic information within the entire candidate shortlist during ranking. At the same time, it naturally produces continuous relevance scores, enabling training on arbitrary retrieval datasets without requiring Likert-scale supervision. Our framework is lightweight and effective, requiring only small-scale models (e.g., 4B parameters) to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art pointwise and listwise rerankers across multiple domains, including Wikipedia and long narrative datasets. It further establishes a new state-of-the-art on the LoCoMo benchmark that assesses the capabilities of dialogue understanding and memory usage. We further demonstrate that our framework supports flexible extensions. For example, augmenting candidate passages with contextual information further improves ranking accuracy, while training attention heads from middle layers enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视觉推理基准（VRB），这是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在解决真实课堂视觉问题能力的新数据集，发现模型在静态技能上表现较好，但在动态空间操作上存在明显瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然AI模型在文本推理方面取得了先进成果，但在空间和关系结构推理方面仍存在关键瓶颈，特别是在依赖视觉的早期数学教育中。需要评估多模态大语言模型能否满足小学教育的实际需求。

Method: 构建了包含701个问题的VRB基准数据集，这些问题来自赞比亚和印度的小学考试，涵盖类比推理、模式完成、空间匹配等任务。使用未经编辑、文本最少的图像来测试模型能否满足小学教育的实际需求。

Result: 研究发现模型能力存在"锯齿状边界"：在计数和缩放等静态技能上表现较好，但在折叠、反射和旋转等动态操作上达到明显的"空间天花板"。这些弱点可能导致课堂使用中的错误评分、虚假支架和强化学生误解。

Conclusion: 像VRB这样的教育导向基准对于确定课堂中使用的多模态工具的功能边界至关重要，有助于识别模型在视觉推理问题上的局限性，避免在教育应用中产生负面影响。

Abstract: AI models have achieved state-of-the-art results in textual reasoning; however, their ability to reason over spatial and relational structures remains a critical bottleneck -- particularly in early-grade maths, which relies heavily on visuals. This paper introduces the visual reasoning benchmark (VRB), a novel dataset designed to evaluate Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on their ability to solve authentic visual problems from classrooms. This benchmark is built on a set of 701 questions sourced from primary school examinations in Zambia and India, which cover a range of tasks such as reasoning by analogy, pattern completion, and spatial matching. We outline the methodology and development of the benchmark which intentionally uses unedited, minimal-text images to test if models can meet realistic needs of primary education. Our findings reveal a ``jagged frontier'' of capability where models demonstrate better proficiency in static skills such as counting and scaling, but reach a distinct ``spatial ceiling'' when faced with dynamic operations like folding, reflection, and rotation. These weaknesses pose a risk for classroom use on visual reasoning problems, with the potential for incorrect marking, false scaffolding, and reinforcing student misconceptions. Consequently, education-focused benchmarks like the VRB are essential for determining the functional boundaries of multimodal tools used in classrooms.

TL;DR: ExStrucTiny：一个新的文档图像结构化信息提取基准数据集，统一了关键实体提取、关系提取和视觉问答任务，用于评估视觉语言模型在多样化文档类型和灵活模式下的细粒度结构化提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档理解基准在多样化文档类型和灵活模式下的细粒度结构化提取能力评估不足。现有的关键实体提取、关系提取和视觉问答数据集存在实体本体狭窄、查询简单或文档类型单一等问题，缺乏对适应性结构化提取需求的研究。

Result: 研究揭示了视觉语言模型在文档结构化信息提取中面临的挑战，包括模式适应、查询规范不足和答案定位等问题。ExStrucTiny为改进通用模型在文档结构化信息提取方面提供了基础。

Conclusion: ExStrucTiny基准填补了现有文档理解评估的空白，为评估和改进视觉语言模型在多样化文档类型和灵活模式下的细粒度结构化提取能力提供了重要基础，有望推动文档信息提取技术的发展。

Abstract: Enterprise documents, such as forms and reports, embed critical information for downstream applications like data archiving, automated workflows, and analytics. Although generalist Vision Language Models (VLMs) perform well on established document understanding benchmarks, their ability to conduct holistic, fine-grained structured extraction across diverse document types and flexible schemas is not well studied. Existing Key Entity Extraction (KEE), Relation Extraction (RE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets are limited by narrow entity ontologies, simple queries, or homogeneous document types, often overlooking the need for adaptable and structured extraction. To address these gaps, we introduce ExStrucTiny, a new benchmark dataset for structured Information Extraction (IE) from document images, unifying aspects of KEE, RE, and VQA. Built through a novel pipeline combining manual and synthetic human-validated samples, ExStrucTiny covers more varied document types and extraction scenarios. We analyze open and closed VLMs on this benchmark, highlighting challenges such as schema adaptation, query under-specification, and answer localization. We hope our work provides a bedrock for improving generalist models for structured IE in documents.

*Julia Belikova,Danila Rozhevskii,Dennis Svirin,Konstantin Polev,Alexander Panchenko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出"token overflow"概念，指压缩表示无法包含足够信息回答查询的情况，并开发了检测方法。研究发现查询无关的饱和统计能区分压缩/未压缩token，但检测溢出能力有限；结合查询信息的轻量级分类器能更好检测溢出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在资源受限环境中的长上下文处理效率问题。软压缩架构通过用学习到的压缩token替换长序列来扩展有效上下文长度，但压缩极限和何时压缩会擦除任务相关内容仍未被充分探索。

Method: 定义"token overflow"概念，提出检测方法。在xRAG软压缩设置中，使用查询无关的饱和统计分离压缩/未压缩token表示，并开发轻量级探测分类器分析查询和上下文xRAG表示。

Result: 查询无关饱和统计能可靠区分压缩和未压缩token表示，但溢出检测能力有限。结合查询信息的轻量级分类器在HotpotQA、SQuADv2和TriviaQA数据集上平均达到0.72 AUC-ROC，显著提升检测性能。

Conclusion: 研究从查询无关诊断发展到查询感知检测器，实现了低成本的预LLM门控机制来减轻压缩引起的错误，为高效长上下文处理提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Efficient long-context processing remains a crucial challenge for contemporary large language models (LLMs), especially in resource-constrained environments. Soft compression architectures promise to extend effective context length by replacing long token sequences with smaller sets of learned compressed tokens. Yet, the limits of compressibility -- and when compression begins to erase task-relevant content -- remain underexplored. In this paper, we define \emph{token overflow} as a regime in which compressed representations no longer contain sufficient information to answer a given query, and propose a methodology to characterize and detect it. In the xRAG soft-compression setting, we find that query-agnostic saturation statistics reliably separate compressed from uncompressed token representations, providing a practical tool for identifying compressed tokens but showing limited overflow detection capability. Lightweight probing classifiers over both query and context xRAG representations detect overflow with 0.72 AUC-ROC on average on HotpotQA, SQuADv2, and TriviaQA datasets, demonstrating that incorporating query information improves detection performance. These results advance from query-independent diagnostics to query-aware detectors, enabling low-cost pre-LLM gating to mitigate compression-induced errors.

### [149] [Moonshine v2: Ergodic Streaming Encoder ASR for Latency-Critical Speech Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12241)
*Manjunath Kudlur,Evan King,James Wang,Pete Warden*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Moonshine v2 是一种用于流式自动语音识别的编码器模型，采用滑动窗口自注意力机制，在保持高精度的同时实现低延迟推理，特别适用于边缘设备上的实时语音应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时语音应用（如实时转录、语音命令、实时翻译）需要在资源受限的边缘设备上实现低首次令牌时间（TTFT）和高转录精度。传统的全注意力Transformer编码器虽然精度高，但具有二次复杂度，导致延迟随语句长度线性增长，不适合流式应用。

Method: 提出Moonshine v2模型，采用遍历式流式编码器架构，使用滑动窗口自注意力机制。这种方法限制了注意力范围，实现了有界、低延迟的推理，同时保留了强大的局部上下文信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中取得了最先进的词错误率，达到了比自身大6倍的模型的精度水平，同时运行速度显著更快。模型在保持与全注意力相当精度的同时，大幅减小了模型大小和延迟成本。

Conclusion: 精心设计的局部注意力机制在精度上可以与全注意力竞争，同时大幅降低模型大小和延迟成本，为边缘设备上的交互式语音界面开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Latency-critical speech applications (e.g., live transcription, voice commands, and real-time translation) demand low time-to-first-token (TTFT) and high transcription accuracy, particularly on resource-constrained edge devices. Full-attention Transformer encoders remain a strong accuracy baseline for automatic speech recognition (ASR) because every frame can directly attend to every other frame, which resolves otherwise locally ambiguous acoustics using distant lexical context. However, this global dependency incurs quadratic complexity in sequence length, inducing an inherent "encode-the-whole-utterance" latency profile. For streaming use cases, this causes TTFT to grow linearly with utterance length as the encoder must process the entire prefix before any decoder token can be emitted. To better meet the needs of on-device, streaming ASR use cases we introduce Moonshine v2, an ergodic streaming-encoder ASR model that employs sliding-window self-attention to achieve bounded, low-latency inference while preserving strong local context. Our models achieve state of the art word error rates across standard benchmarks, attaining accuracy on-par with models 6x their size while running significantly faster. These results demonstrate that carefully designed local attention is competitive with the accuracy of full attention at a fraction of the size and latency cost, opening new possibilities for interactive speech interfaces on edge devices.

Abstract: This paper presents a technical curriculum on language-oriented artificial intelligence (AI) in the language and translation (L&T) industry. The curriculum aims to foster domain-specific technical AI literacy among stakeholders in the fields of translation and specialised communication by exposing them to the conceptual and technical/algorithmic foundations of modern language-oriented AI in an accessible way. The core curriculum focuses on 1) vector embeddings, 2) the technical foundations of neural networks, 3) tokenization and 4) transformer neural networks. It is intended to help users develop computational thinking as well as algorithmic awareness and algorithmic agency, ultimately contributing to their digital resilience in AI-driven work environments. The didactic suitability of the curriculum was tested in an AI-focused MA course at the Institute of Translation and Multilingual Communication at TH Koeln. Results suggest the didactic effectiveness of the curriculum, but participant feedback indicates that it should be embedded into higher-level didactic scaffolding - e.g., in the form of lecturer support - in order to enable optimal learning conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型理论上能通过并行解码实现快速文本生成，但实际推理效率受限于需要大量细化步骤，而激进减少步骤会导致生成质量显著下降。

Method: 提出轨迹自蒸馏框架，结合直接判别优化（DDO）的反向KL目标，促进模式寻求蒸馏，使学生模型专注于教师模型的高概率模式。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在严格步骤预算下持续优于强少步基线方法和标准训练。虽然全步解码仍更优，但显著缩小了质量差距。

Conclusion: 为实用的少步扩散大语言模型建立了坚实基础，通过轨迹自蒸馏显著提升了少步解码性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation framework that improves few-step decoding by distilling the model's own generative trajectories. We incorporate Direct Discriminative Optimization (DDO), a reverse-KL objective that promotes mode-seeking distillation and encourages the student to concentrate on high-probability teacher modes. Across benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms strong few-step baselines and standard training under tight step budgets. Although full-step decoding remains superior, we substantially narrow the gap, establishing a strong foundation towards practical few-step DLLMs. The source code is available at https://github.com/Tyrion58/T3D.

Conclusion: OPCD有效实现了经验知识蒸馏和系统提示蒸馏，支持跨尺寸蒸馏，让小模型能从大教师模型中内化经验知识

Abstract: Context distillation enables language models to internalize in-context knowledge into their parameters. In our work, we propose On-Policy Context Distillation (OPCD), a framework that bridges on-policy distillation with context distillation by training a student model on its own generated trajectories while minimizing reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence against a context-conditioned teacher. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OPCD on two important applications: experiential knowledge distillation, where models extract and consolidate transferable knowledge from their historical solution traces, and system prompt distillation, where models internalize beneficial behaviors encoded in optimized prompts. Across mathematical reasoning, text-based games, and domain-specific tasks, OPCD consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher task accuracy while better preserving out-of-distribution capabilities. We further show that OPCD enables effective cross-size distillation, where smaller student models can internalize experiential knowledge from larger teachers.

TL;DR: Filmsticking++ 是一种改进的表面重建方法，通过加权距离的受限功率图解决现有RVD-based filmsticking方法在深内部空腔情况下无法插值所有点的问题，同时利用虚拟站点加速外部中轴的排除，降低了计算成本并提高了鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RVD-based filmsticking方法在重建低质量点云时存在局限性，特别是在处理深内部空腔时无法插值所有点，导致拓扑错误。这源于欧几里得距离度量的固有限制。

Method: 1. 使用加权距离的受限功率图替代欧几里得距离的受限Voronoi图，确保所有点都能被插值；2. 在引导表面内部放置虚拟站点，加速外部中轴从内部排除的过程。

Result: 相比现有SOTA方法，Filmsticking++能够插值所有点（包括深内部空腔情况），同时降低了计算成本，提高了鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Filmsticking++通过加权距离度量和虚拟站点策略，克服了现有方法的局限性，为无法向量的点云提供了更可靠、高效的显式表面重建解决方案。

Abstract: Explicit surface reconstruction aims to generate a surface mesh that exactly interpolates a given point cloud. This requirement is crucial when the point cloud must lie non-negotiably on the final surface to preserve sharp features and fine geometric details. However, the task becomes substantially challenging with low-quality point clouds, due to inherent reconstruction ambiguities compounded by combinatorial complexity. A previous method using filmsticking technique by iteratively compute restricted Voronoi diagram to address these issues, ensures to produce a watertight manifold, setting a new benchmark as the state-of-the-art (SOTA) technique. Unfortunately, RVD-based filmsticking is inability to interpolate all points in the case of deep internal cavities, resulting in very likely is the generation of faulty topology. The cause of this issue is that RVD-based filmsticking has inherent limitations due to Euclidean distance metrics. In this paper, we extend the filmsticking technique, named Filmsticking++. Filmsticking++ reconstructing an explicit surface from points without normals. On one hand, Filmsticking++ break through the inherent limitations of Euclidean distance by employing a weighted-distance-based Restricted Power Diagram, which guarantees that all points are interpolated. On the other hand, we observe that as the guiding surface increasingly approximates the target shape, the external medial axis is gradually expelled outside the guiding surface. Building on this observation, we propose placing virtual sites inside the guiding surface to accelerate the expulsion of the external medial axis from its interior. To summarize, contrary to the SOTA method, Filmsticking++ demonstrates multiple benefits, including decreases computational cost, improved robustness and scalability.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)能准确捕捉复杂植物结构，但内存占用高且缺乏网格拓扑，无法与传统游戏生产流程兼容

Method: 利用叶子形状重复性，从非结构化3DGS分割叶子，选择代表性叶子组转换为薄锐网格模板，通过可微分移动最小二乘变形将模板拟合到所有其他叶子

Result: LeafFit在分割质量和变形精度上优于现有基线，显著减少数据大小并支持参数级编辑，运行时通过顶点着色器高效评估变形

Conclusion: LeafFit成功将3DGS植物转换为可编辑的实例化网格资产，解决了3DGS与游戏生产流程的兼容性问题，实现了高质量、低存储的植物资产创建

Abstract: We propose LeafFit, a pipeline that converts 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) of individual plants into editable, instanced mesh assets. While 3DGS faithfully captures complex foliage, its high memory footprint and lack of mesh topology make it incompatible with traditional game production workflows. We address this by leveraging the repetition of leaf shapes; our method segments leaves from the unstructured 3DGS, with optional user interaction included as a fallback. A representative leaf group is selected and converted into a thin, sharp mesh to serve as a template; this template is then fitted to all other leaves via differentiable Moving Least Squares (MLS) deformation. At runtime, the deformation is evaluated efficiently on-the-fly using a vertex shader to minimize storage requirements. Experiments demonstrate that LeafFit achieves higher segmentation quality and deformation accuracy than recent baselines while significantly reducing data size and enabling parameter-level editing.

Motivation: 现有的3D高斯泼溅间接编辑方法存在跨视图不一致问题，限制了编辑的灵活性和效率。这些方法先在2D渲染空间编辑，再投影回3D，导致不一致性。

Method: 提出VF-Editor，通过设计新颖的变化预测器从2D编辑知识中蒸馏学习。该预测器编码输入生成变化场，使用两个可学习的并行解码函数迭代推断每个3D高斯的属性变化。

Conclusion: VF-Editor能够无缝地从多种2D编辑器和策略中蒸馏编辑知识到单一预测器中，实现了灵活有效的3D领域知识迁移，解决了间接编辑的固有问题。

Abstract: Indirect editing methods for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have recently witnessed significant advancements. These approaches operate by first applying edits in the rendered 2D space and subsequently projecting the modifications back into 3D. However, this paradigm inevitably introduces cross-view inconsistencies and constrains both the flexibility and efficiency of the editing process. To address these challenges, we present VF-Editor, which enables native editing of Gaussian primitives by predicting attribute variations in a feedforward manner. To accurately and efficiently estimate these variations, we design a novel variation predictor distilled from 2D editing knowledge. The predictor encodes the input to generate a variation field and employs two learnable, parallel decoding functions to iteratively infer attribute changes for each 3D Gaussian. Thanks to its unified design, VF-Editor can seamlessly distill editing knowledge from diverse 2D editors and strategies into a single predictor, allowing for flexible and effective knowledge transfer into the 3D domain. Extensive experiments on both public and private datasets reveal the inherent limitations of indirect editing pipelines and validate the effectiveness and flexibility of our approach.

Motivation: 当前单图像生成3D头像的方法无法同时满足三个关键需求：1）前馈式处理（无需逐实例优化），2）360°完整头部建模，3）可直接用于动画。现有工作最多只能同时满足其中两点。

Method: 提出两个核心模块：1）语义感知网格变形模块，利用多视角法线优化FLAME头部模型（包含头发），保持拓扑结构；2）多视角特征投射模块，通过可微分双线性投射、分层UV映射和可见性感知融合，构建共享的规范UV表示。

Conclusion: OMEGA-Avatar是首个同时实现前馈、360°完整和可动画的单图像3D头像生成框架，通过创新的语义感知网格变形和多视角特征投射技术解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D avatars from a single image remains a formidable challenge. We identified three desirable attributes of avatar generation: 1) the method should be feed-forward, 2) model a 360° full-head, and 3) should be animation-ready. However, current work addresses only two of the three points simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose OMEGA-Avatar, the first feed-forward framework that simultaneously generates a generalizable, 360°-complete, and animatable 3D Gaussian head from a single image. Starting from a feed-forward and animatable framework, we address the 360° full-head avatar generation problem with two novel components. First, to overcome poor hair modeling in full-head avatar generation, we introduce a semantic-aware mesh deformation module that integrates multi-view normals to optimize a FLAME head with hair while preserving its topology structure. Second, to enable effective feed-forward decoding of full-head features, we propose a multi-view feature splatting module that constructs a shared canonical UV representation from features across multiple views through differentiable bilinear splatting, hierarchical UV mapping, and visibility-aware fusion. This approach preserves both global structural coherence and local high-frequency details across all viewpoints, ensuring 360° consistency without per-instance optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMEGA-Avatar achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines in 360° full-head completeness while robustly preserving identity across different viewpoints.

We marry the scatter-gather approach to mesh processing with tensor-based workflows and rely on the adjoint method applied to user-specified imperative code to generate an efficient backward pass behind the scenes. We demonstrate our approach by differentiating through mean curvature flow, spectral conformal parameterization, geodesic distance computation, and as-rigid-as-possible deformation, examining usability and performance on these applications. Our system allows practitioners to differentiate through existing geometry processing algorithms without needing to reformulate them, resulting in low implementation effort, fast runtimes, and lower memory requirements than differentiable optimization tools not tailored to geometry processing.

### [158] [Explaining AI Without Code: A User Study on Explainable AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11159)
*Natalia Abarca,Andrés Carvallo,Claudia López Moncada,Felipe Bravo-Marquez*

TL;DR: 在DashAI无代码ML平台中集成PDP、PFI和KernelSHAP三种可解释性技术，通过用户研究验证了对新手和专家的可用性及信任影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在敏感领域的应用日益增多，但现有XAI方法需要技术专业知识，限制了非专业人士的使用。无代码ML平台旨在民主化AI，但通常缺乏可解释性功能，这在使用敏感数据时尤为关键。

Method: 在开源无代码ML平台DashAI中开发了一个以人为中心的XAI模块，集成了三种互补技术：部分依赖图(PDP)、排列特征重要性(PFI)和KernelSHAP。通过用户研究(N=20，包括ML新手和专家)评估可用性和解释效果。

Result: 1) 所有可解释性任务的成功率≥80%；2) 新手在解释满意度量表(ESS)上认为解释有用、准确且可信，而专家对充分性和完整性更挑剔；3) 解释提高了在自动化信任量表(TiA)上的可预测性和信心感知，新手比专家表现出更高的信任度。

Conclusion: 研究突显了无代码ML中XAI的核心挑战：需要使解释既对新手可访问，又对专家足够详细。在DashAI中集成多种XAI技术有助于弥合这一差距，但需要平衡不同用户群体的需求。

Abstract: The increasing use of Machine Learning (ML) in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and public policy has raised concerns about the transparency of automated decisions. Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this by clarifying how models generate predictions, yet most methods demand technical expertise, limiting their value for novices. This gap is especially critical in no-code ML platforms, which seek to democratize AI but rarely include explainability. We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform. The module integrates three complementary techniques, which are Partial Dependence Plots (PDP), Permutation Feature Importance (PFI), and KernelSHAP, into DashAI's workflow for tabular classification. A user study (N = 20; ML novices and experts) evaluated usability and the impact of explanations. Results show: (i) high task success ($\geq80\%$) across all explainability tasks; (ii) novices rated explanations as useful, accurate, and trustworthy on the Explanation Satisfaction Scale (ESS, Cronbach's $α$ = 0.74, a measure of internal consistency), while experts were more critical of sufficiency and completeness; and (iii) explanations improved perceived predictability and confidence on the Trust in Automation scale (TiA, $α$ = 0.60), with novices showing higher trust than experts. These findings highlight a central challenge for XAI in no-code ML, making explanations both accessible to novices and sufficiently detailed for experts.

### [159] [Latent Generative Solvers for Generalizable Long-Term Physics Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11229)
*Zituo Chen,Haixu Wu,Sili Deng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LGS是一个两阶段框架，通过VAE将不同PDE系统映射到共享潜在物理空间，再用Transformer学习概率潜在动力学，通过不确定性调节和流强迫机制实现长期稳定预测，计算效率比基线高70倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构PDE系统的长期代理模拟问题，传统方法在长期预测中容易产生漂移，需要更可靠、不确定性感知的神经PDE求解器来支持长期预测和下游科学工作流。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 用预训练VAE将不同PDE状态映射到共享潜在物理空间；2) 用Transformer通过流匹配学习概率潜在动力学。关键机制包括不确定性调节（扰动潜在输入以纠正离流形漂移）和流强迫（从模型生成轨迹更新系统描述符以对齐训练/测试条件）。

Result: 在包含12个PDE家族的约250万条轨迹（128^2分辨率）上预训练，短期预测与确定性神经算子基线相当，长期预测显著减少漂移。潜在空间学习加高效架构选择使FLOPs比非生成基线低70倍，能在有限微调预算下高效适应256^2分辨率的分布外Kolmogorov流数据集。

Conclusion: LGS为可泛化、不确定性感知的神经PDE求解器提供了实用路径，在长期预测和下游科学工作流中更可靠，通过潜在空间学习和高效架构实现了可扩展的预训练。

Abstract: We study long-horizon surrogate simulation across heterogeneous PDE systems. We introduce Latent Generative Solvers (LGS), a two-stage framework that (i) maps diverse PDE states into a shared latent physics space with a pretrained VAE, and (ii) learns probabilistic latent dynamics with a Transformer trained by flow matching. Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \textbf{70$\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets. Overall, LGS provides a practical route toward generalizable, uncertainty-aware neural PDE solvers that are more reliable for long-term forecasting and downstream scientific workflows.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出决策值映射和DecisionDB基础设施，用于记录、重放和审计不同数据表示对计算结果的影​​响，将表示空间划分为持久性区域和边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相同数据的不同表示形式可能导致计算引擎产生不同的离散结果，需要系统化地记录哪些表示能保持结果一致、哪些会改变结果，以支持决策的可重用性和可验证性。

Method: 形式化决策值映射概念，开发DecisionDB基础设施，通过内容计算标识符，以只写形式存储工件，支持确定性重放来精确恢复记录的决策标识符。

Result: 实现了将表示空间划分为持久性区域（保持结果一致）和边界（改变结果），决策重用成为可机械检查的条件，所有三个标识字段都能与持久化值匹配。

Conclusion: 决策值映射和DecisionDB为理解数据表示对计算结果的影响提供了系统化框架，支持决策审计和重用验证，增强了计算过程的可信度。

Abstract: A computational engine applied to different representations of the same data can produce different discrete outcomes, with some representations preserving the result and others changing it entirely. A decision-valued map records which representations preserve the outcome and which change it, associating each member of a declared representation family with the discrete result it produces. This paper formalizes decision-valued maps and describes DecisionDB, an infrastructure that logs, replays and audits these relationships using identifiers computed from content and artifacts stored in write-once form. Deterministic replay recovers each recorded decision identifier exactly from stored artifacts, with all three identifying fields matching their persisted values. The contribution partitions representation space into persistence regions and boundaries, and treats decision reuse as a mechanically checkable condition.

TL;DR: Voxtral Realtime 是一个原生流式自动语音识别模型，在亚秒级延迟下达到离线转录质量，性能与 Whisper 相当，采用端到端流式训练和延迟流建模框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式语音识别系统通常通过分块或滑动窗口等方式适配离线模型，这种方法无法实现真正的流式处理，在延迟和准确性之间存在权衡。需要开发原生支持流式处理的端到端模型，在保持低延迟的同时达到离线转录质量。

Method: 基于延迟流建模框架，引入新的因果音频编码器和 Ada RMS-Norm 改进延迟条件化。采用端到端流式训练，显式对齐音频和文本流。在包含13种语言的大规模数据集上进行预训练。

Result: 在480ms延迟下，Voxtral Realtime 的性能与最广泛部署的离线转录系统 Whisper 相当。模型权重以 Apache 2.0 许可证发布。

Conclusion: Voxtral Realtime 展示了原生流式语音识别模型可以在亚秒级延迟下达到离线转录质量，为实时语音识别应用提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Voxtral Realtime, a natively streaming automatic speech recognition model that matches offline transcription quality at sub-second latency. Unlike approaches that adapt offline models through chunking or sliding windows, Voxtral Realtime is trained end-to-end for streaming, with explicit alignment between audio and text streams. Our architecture builds on the Delayed Streams Modeling framework, introducing a new causal audio encoder and Ada RMS-Norm for improved delay conditioning. We scale pretraining to a large-scale dataset spanning 13 languages. At a delay of 480ms, Voxtral Realtime achieves performance on par with Whisper, the most widely deployed offline transcription system. We release the model weights under the Apache 2.0 license.

### [162] [The PBSAI Governance Ecosystem: A Multi-Agent AI Reference Architecture for Securing Enterprise AI Estates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11301)
*John M. Willis*

TL;DR: 本文提出了PBSAI治理生态系统，这是一个用于保护企业和大规模AI资产的多智能体参考架构，通过12个领域分类和智能体家族实现安全治理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业正在大规模部署LLM、RAG管道和工具使用智能体，这些系统构成复杂的AI资产，但现有治理框架缺乏针对多智能体AI网络安全防御的可实施架构。

Method: 提出PBSAI治理生态系统，采用12个领域分类法，定义有界的智能体家族，通过共享上下文信封和结构化输出契约在工具与策略之间进行协调，并建立轻量级形式化模型。

Result: PBSAI与NIST AI RMF功能对齐，展示了在企业SOC和大规模防御环境中的应用，提供了可追溯性、来源验证和人机交互保证。

Conclusion: PBSAI为开放生态系统开发和未来实证验证提供了结构化、以证据为中心的基础，填补了多智能体AI安全治理架构的空白。

Abstract: Enterprises are rapidly deploying large language models, retrieval augmented generation pipelines, and tool using agents into production, often on shared high performance computing clusters and cloud accelerator platforms that also support defensive analytics. These systems increasingly function not as isolated models but as AI estates: socio technical systems spanning models, agents, data pipelines, security tooling, human workflows, and hyperscale infrastructure. Existing governance and security frameworks, including the NIST AI Risk Management Framework and systems security engineering guidance, articulate principles and risk functions but do not provide implementable architectures for multi agent, AI enabled cyber defense.
  This paper introduces the Practitioners Blueprint for Secure AI (PBSAI) Governance Ecosystem, a multi agent reference architecture for securing enterprise and hyperscale AI estates. PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains. We demonstrate alignment with NIST AI RMF functions and illustrate application in enterprise SOC and hyperscale defensive environments. PBSAI is proposed as a structured, evidence centric foundation for open ecosystem development and future empirical validation.

TL;DR: 该论文批判机器学习中"ground truth"范式的实证主义谬误，提出人类分歧是重要社会技术信号而非技术噪声，并分析数据标注实践中的系统性偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文动机是挑战机器学习中"ground truth"范式的基础假设，揭示该范式将人类分歧视为技术噪声而非重要社会技术信号的实证主义谬误，并探讨数据标注实践中导致"共识陷阱"的机制。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析2020-2025年间在ACL、AIES、CHI、CSCW、EAAMO、FAccT、NeurIPS等七个顶级会议发表的论文。通过分层关键词过滤从30,897条记录筛选出3,042条高召回率语料，最终人工筛选纳入346篇论文进行定性综合和反思性主题分析。

Result: 研究发现：1) 系统性位置可读性失败与人类作为验证者模型的架构转变相结合，特别是依赖模型介导的标注，引入了根深蒂固的锚定偏见并实质上排除了人类声音；2) 地理霸权将西方规范强加为普遍基准，通常通过不稳定数据工作者的表演性对齐来强制执行；3) 统计模型将文化多元性误诊为随机误差的"噪声传感器"谬误。

Conclusion: 论文主张将分歧重新视为构建文化胜任模型所需的高保真信号，并提出多元化标注基础设施的路线图，将目标从发现单一"正确"答案转向映射人类经验的多样性。

Abstract: In machine learning, "ground truth" refers to the assumed correct labels used to train and evaluate models. However, the foundational "ground truth" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this "consensus trap". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the "noisy sensor" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular "right" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.

TL;DR: BLPO：一种双层提示优化框架，通过将图像转换为文本表示来解决多模态LLM评估中的上下文限制问题，提升AI生成图像评估的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为AI生成内容的自动评估器已被广泛采用，但将其评估结果与人类判断对齐仍具挑战性。现有的自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本评估，在多模态场景下（特别是图像评估）由于上下文窗口限制而效果有限。

Method: 提出BLPO（Bi-Level Prompt Optimization）双层提示优化框架：1）将图像转换为保留评估相关视觉线索的文本表示；2）联合优化评估提示和图像到文本转换提示，在有限的上下文预算下保持保真度。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个LLM评估器上的实验证明了该方法的有效性，能够显著提升多模态LLM评估与人类判断的对齐程度。

Conclusion: BLPO框架成功解决了多模态LLM评估中的上下文限制问题，通过图像到文本转换和双层优化策略，实现了更高效、准确的AI生成图像评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become widely adopted as automated judges for evaluating AI-generated content. Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues. Our bi-level optimization approach jointly refines the judge prompt and the I2T prompt to maintain fidelity under limited context budgets. Experiments on four datasets and three LLM judges demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AgentNoiseBench框架，用于系统评估智能体模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，通过分析现实世界噪声类型并开发自动化噪声注入管道，发现当前智能体模型对现实环境扰动高度敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在基准测试中表现良好，但在现实世界部署中性能下降，主要原因是现有训练和评估范式基于理想化假设，忽略了现实交互中固有的随机性和噪声。

Method: 1) 深入分析现实场景中的偏差和不确定性，将环境噪声分为用户噪声和工具噪声两类；2) 开发自动化管道，在保持任务可解性的前提下向现有智能体基准注入可控噪声；3) 使用该管道对多种架构和参数规模的模型进行广泛评估。

Result: 评估结果显示，在不同噪声条件下，智能体模型性能出现一致的变化，突显了当前智能体模型对现实环境扰动的敏感性。

Conclusion: AgentNoiseBench框架能够系统评估智能体模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型对现实世界噪声的敏感性，为改进智能体模型的鲁棒性提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled LLM-based agents to achieve strong performance on a variety of benchmarks. However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.

Motivation: 现有主动型LLM智能体训练方法面临任务性能与用户参与度之间的平衡难题：被动智能体无法有效适应用户意图，而过度使用人类反馈会降低用户满意度。

Method: 提出BAO框架，结合行为增强（丰富主动推理和信息收集能力）和行为正则化（抑制低效或冗余交互，使智能体行为与用户期望对齐）。

Result: 在UserRL基准套件的多个任务上评估，BAO显著优于主动智能体强化学习基线，性能与商业LLM智能体相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: BAO框架能有效训练复杂多轮场景中主动且用户对齐的LLM智能体，平衡任务完成效率与用户体验。

Abstract: Proactive large language model (LLM) agents aim to actively plan, query, and interact over multiple turns, enabling efficient task completion beyond passive instruction following and making them essential for real-world, user-centric applications. Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) has recently emerged as a promising solution for training such agents in multi-turn settings, allowing interaction strategies to be learned from feedback. However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

Conclusion: ReplicatorBench填补了现有基准测试的空白，为评估AI代理在科研复现中的真实能力提供了更全面的框架，揭示了当前LLM代理在资源获取方面的局限性

Abstract: The literature has witnessed an emerging interest in AI agents for automated assessment of scientific papers. Existing benchmarks focus primarily on the computational aspect of this task, testing agents' ability to reproduce or replicate research outcomes when having access to the code and data. This setting, while foundational, (1) fails to capture the inconsistent availability of new data for replication as opposed to reproduction, and (2) lacks ground-truth diversity by focusing only on reproducible papers, thereby failing to evaluate an agent's ability to identify non-replicable research. Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access. Our findings reveal that while current LLM agents are capable of effectively designing and executing computational experiments, they struggle with retrieving resources, such as new data, necessary to replicate a claim. All code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/CenterForOpenScience/llm-benchmarking.

TL;DR: C-JEPA：一种面向对象的世界模型，通过对象级掩码实现交互推理，在视觉问答和智能体控制任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于对象中心表示的世界模型不足以捕捉交互依赖的动态关系，需要更强的关系理解能力来支持预测、推理和控制

Method: 将掩码联合嵌入预测从图像块扩展到对象中心表示，通过对象级掩码要求从其他对象推断目标对象状态，从而诱导潜在干预并防止捷径解决方案

Result: 在视觉问答中反事实推理绝对提升约20%；在智能体控制任务中，仅需基于块的世界模型1%的潜在输入特征即可达到相当性能，规划效率大幅提升

Conclusion: 对象级掩码通过潜在干预诱导因果归纳偏置，C-JEPA为需要交互推理的世界建模提供了简单灵活且有效的解决方案

Abstract: World models require robust relational understanding to support prediction, reasoning, and control. While object-centric representations provide a useful abstraction, they are not sufficient to capture interaction-dependent dynamics. We therefore propose C-JEPA, a simple and flexible object-centric world model that extends masked joint embedding prediction from image patches to object-centric representations. By applying object-level masking that requires an object's state to be inferred from other objects, C-JEPA induces latent interventions with counterfactual-like effects and prevents shortcut solutions, making interaction reasoning essential. Empirically, C-JEPA leads to consistent gains in visual question answering, with an absolute improvement of about 20\% in counterfactual reasoning compared to the same architecture without object-level masking. On agent control tasks, C-JEPA enables substantially more efficient planning by using only 1\% of the total latent input features required by patch-based world models, while achieving comparable performance. Finally, we provide a formal analysis demonstrating that object-level masking induces a causal inductive bias via latent interventions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GHOST：一种针对Mamba2模型的结构化剪枝框架，通过仅使用前向传播统计量近似控制理论平衡截断，实现50%状态维度减少而困惑度仅增加约1点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba2扩展的状态维度增强了时序建模能力，但在自回归生成过程中会产生显著的推理开销，导致带宽饱和。传统剪枝方法无法解决这一瓶颈：非结构化稀疏性使激活保持密集，基于幅度的选择忽略了运行时动态，而基于梯度的方法成本过高。

Method: GHOST（分组隐藏状态输出感知选择和截断）是一种结构化剪枝框架，仅使用前向传播统计量来近似控制理论平衡截断。通过联合测量可控性和可观测性，该方法在不需反向传播的情况下达到与基于梯度方法相当的保真度。

Result: 在130M到2.7B参数的模型上，该方法实现了50%的状态维度减少，在WikiText-2数据集上困惑度仅增加约1点。

Conclusion: GHOST提供了一种高效的结构化剪枝方法，显著减少Mamba2模型的推理开销，同时保持模型性能，为解决状态空间模型的计算瓶颈提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While Mamba2's expanded state dimension enhances temporal modeling, it incurs substantial inference overhead that saturates bandwidth during autoregressive generation. Standard pruning methods fail to address this bottleneck: unstructured sparsity leaves activations dense, magnitude-based selection ignores runtime dynamics, and gradient-based methods impose prohibitive costs. We introduce GHOST (Grouped Hidden-state Output-aware Selection and Truncation), a structured pruning framework that approximates control-theoretic balanced truncation using only forward-pass statistics. By jointly measuring controllability and observability, GHOST rivals the fidelity of gradient-based methods without requiring backpropagation. As a highlight, on models ranging from 130M to 2.7B parameters, our approach achieves a 50\% state-dimension reduction with approximately 1 perplexity point increase on WikiText-2.

TL;DR: TRACER是一种轨迹级不确定性度量方法，用于检测多轮工具使用交互中的关键故障，通过结合内容感知、情境感知信号和尾部风险聚合，显著提升任务失败预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性代理主要关注单次文本生成，无法捕捉多轮交互中由稀疏关键事件（如循环、工具使用不连贯、用户-代理不协调）引发的轨迹级故障信号。

Method: TRACER结合内容感知惊奇度、情境感知信号、语义和词汇重复、工具基础连贯性差距，并使用尾部聚焦风险函数和MAX复合步骤风险进行聚合，以识别决定性异常。

Result: 在τ²-bench上评估，TRACER在预测任务失败和选择性任务执行方面，AUROC提升高达37.1%，AUARC提升高达55%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRACER能够更早、更准确地检测复杂对话工具使用场景中的不确定性，为AI代理在真实世界多轮交互中的可靠性评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating uncertainty for AI agents in real-world multi-turn tool-using interaction with humans is difficult because failures are often triggered by sparse critical episodes (e.g., looping, incoherent tool use, or user-agent miscoordination) even when local generation appears confident. Existing uncertainty proxies focus on single-shot text generation and therefore miss these trajectory-level breakdown signals. We introduce TRACER, a trajectory-level uncertainty metric for dual-control Tool-Agent-User interaction. TRACER combines content-aware surprisal with situational-awareness signals, semantic and lexical repetition, and tool-grounded coherence gaps, and aggregates them using a tail-focused risk functional with a MAX-composite step risk to surface decisive anomalies. We evaluate TRACER on $τ^2$-bench by predicting task failure and selective task execution. To this end, TRACER improves AUROC by up to 37.1% and AUARC by up to 55% over baselines, enabling earlier and more accurate detection of uncertainty in complex conversational tool-use settings.

TL;DR: 提出分布鲁棒的IGM原则(DrIGM)，确保在环境不确定性下智能体的鲁棒贪婪动作与团队最优联合动作一致，并开发了与现有价值分解架构兼容的鲁棒变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体强化学习中的集中训练分散执行方法依赖IGM原则，但在现实世界环境不确定性（如仿真到现实的差距、模型不匹配、系统噪声）下可靠性不足。

Method: 提出分布鲁棒的IGM原则(DrIGM)，定义鲁棒个体动作价值函数，确保智能体的鲁棒贪婪动作与团队最优联合动作对齐。基于此开发了与VDN/QMIX/QTRAN等现有价值分解架构兼容的鲁棒变体，使用鲁棒Q目标进行训练。

Result: 在高保真SustainGym仿真器和星际争霸游戏环境中，该方法显著提升了分布外性能表现，同时保持了可扩展性，并能无缝集成到现有代码库中。

Conclusion: DrIGM原则为多智能体强化学习提供了理论保证的鲁棒性，其兼容现有架构的实现方式使得在实际应用中部署鲁棒多智能体系统更加可行。

Abstract: Cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) commonly adopts centralized training with decentralized execution, where value-factorization methods enforce the individual-global-maximum (IGM) principle so that decentralized greedy actions recover the team-optimal joint action. However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping. Empirically, on high-fidelity SustainGym simulators and a StarCraft game environment, our methods consistently improve out-of-distribution performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL)框架，通过选择性强化高连接性视觉锚点token来提升多模态强化学习的推理质量，仅需1.2%开销就能让32B模型在MathVista上超越72B基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管可验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)显著提升了多模态大语言模型的推理能力，但视觉证据在推理过程中如何被整合仍不清楚。研究者希望理解多模态RLVR中视觉-文本的注意力连接机制，并基于此改进训练效率。

Method: 通过跨模态注意力连接性分析发现只有约15%的token具有强视觉-文本耦合，这些高连接性token作为视觉锚点。基于此提出AT-RL框架，使用基于图的注意力拓扑聚类来选择性强化这些锚点token，而非所有token。

Result: AT-RL仅引入1.2%开销，使32B模型在MathVista上达到80.2分，超越72B-Instruct基准。在STEM、视频和通用任务上均观察到一致提升。相反，仅训练低连接性token会导致严重性能下降。

Conclusion: 推理质量不是由token数量决定，而是由跨模态锚点的保真度决定。有效的多模态强化学习依赖于对视觉锚点的精确信用分配，AT-RL通过选择性强化高连接性token实现了高效的多模态推理提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), yet how visual evidence is integrated during reasoning remains poorly understood. We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentLeak是首个针对多智能体LLM系统隐私泄露的全面基准测试，覆盖内部通信通道，发现输出审计会遗漏41.7%的隐私违规，智能体间消息是主要漏洞源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试无法测量多智能体LLM系统的隐私风险，因为敏感数据会通过智能体间消息、共享内存和工具参数等内部通道传递，而这些通道在仅关注输出的审计中从未被检查。

Method: 提出AgentLeak基准测试，包含1000个跨医疗、金融、法律和企业领域的场景，配备32类攻击分类法和三层检测管道，测试了GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3.5 Sonnet、Mistral Large和Llama 3.3 70B等模型在4979个跟踪记录中的表现。

Result: 多智能体配置降低了单通道输出泄露（27.2% vs 43.2%），但未监控的内部通道使系统总暴露率达到68.9%。智能体间消息泄露率高达68.8%，而输出通道仅为27.2%，输出审计会遗漏41.7%的违规。Claude 3.5 Sonnet在外部（3.3%）和内部（28.1%）通道上都表现最佳。

Conclusion: 多智能体LLM系统需要协调框架来整合内部通道隐私保护，并对智能体间通信强制执行隐私控制，因为智能体间通信是主要漏洞，当前输出审计方法严重不足。

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems create privacy risks that current benchmarks cannot measure. When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability. These findings underscore the need for coordination frameworks that incorporate internal-channel privacy protections and enforce privacy controls on inter-agent communication.

Motivation: 现有AI方法主要关注学习任务特定输出或静态知识表示，忽视了内部推理结构、行动调度策略和学习机制本身的持续优化，这限制了AI系统在动态现实环境中的持续适应能力。

Conclusion: 将内部推理过程作为主要学习对象的方法能够有效提升AI系统的持续适应能力，实现认知架构的渐进演化，为开发在动态现实环境中具有持续学习能力的AI系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning internal reasoning processes is crucial for developing AI systems capable of sustained adaptation in dynamic real-world environments. However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability. Experimental results on a temperature sensor abnormality detection task show that incorporating internal-process learning reduces average runtime by 23.9%.

Motivation: 传统因果分析工作流程存在显著技术壁垒，要求研究者同时具备统计学和计算机科学背景，需要手动选择算法、处理数据质量问题并解释复杂结果，限制了因果推断在医疗、经济和社会科学等领域的应用

Method: 提出CausalAgent对话式多智能体系统，创新性地整合多智能体系统(MAS)、检索增强生成(RAG)和模型上下文协议(MCP)，实现从数据清洗、因果结构学习到偏差校正和报告生成的自动化流程，用户只需上传数据集并用自然语言提问

Conclusion: CausalAgent作为一种新颖的用户中心化人机协作范式，通过显式建模分析工作流程和交互式可视化，为因果推断提供了易用且可靠的工具，有望推动因果推断在更多领域的应用

Abstract: Causal inference holds immense value in fields such as healthcare, economics, and social sciences. However, traditional causal analysis workflows impose significant technical barriers, requiring researchers to possess dual backgrounds in statistics and computer science, while manually selecting algorithms, handling data quality issues, and interpreting complex results. To address these challenges, we propose CausalAgent, a conversational multi-agent system for end-to-end causal inference. The system innovatively integrates Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to achieve automation from data cleaning and causal structure learning to bias correction and report generation through natural language interaction. Users need only upload a dataset and pose questions in natural language to receive a rigorous, interactive analysis report. As a novel user-centered human-AI collaboration paradigm, CausalAgent explicitly models the analysis workflow. By leveraging interactive visualizations, it significantly lowers the barrier to entry for causal analysis while ensuring the rigor and interpretability of the process.

Motivation: 研究预算受限的工具增强型智能体问题，其中大语言模型需要在严格货币预算下通过调用外部工具解决多步任务。传统规划方法由于状态-动作空间巨大、结果方差高和探索成本过高而难以直接应用。

Method: 提出INTENT推理时规划框架，采用意图感知分层世界模型来预测未来工具使用、风险校准成本，并在线指导决策。该框架将问题形式化为上下文空间中的序列决策过程，考虑价格化和随机性的工具执行。

Result: 在成本增强的StableToolBench上，INTENT在严格强制执行硬预算可行性的同时，显著提高了任务成功率。在工具价格变化和预算波动的动态市场变化下，INTENT表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: INTENT框架有效解决了预算受限工具增强型智能体的规划挑战，通过意图感知分层建模和风险校准成本预测，在严格预算约束下实现了更好的任务性能和对动态环境的适应性。

Abstract: We study budget-constrained tool-augmented agents, where a large language model must solve multi-step tasks by invoking external tools under a strict monetary budget. We formalize this setting as sequential decision making in context space with priced and stochastic tool executions, making direct planning intractable due to massive state-action spaces, high variance of outcomes and prohibitive exploration cost. To address these challenges, we propose INTENT, an inference-time planning framework that leverages an intention-aware hierarchical world model to anticipate future tool usage, risk-calibrated cost, and guide decisions online. Across cost-augmented StableToolBench, INTENT strictly enforces hard budget feasibility while substantially improving task success over baselines, and remains robust under dynamic market shifts such as tool price changes and varying budgets.

TL;DR: SemaPop-GAN：结合大语言模型与生成对抗网络的人口合成框架，通过语义人物画像条件约束提升生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人口合成方法主要依赖结构化属性和统计约束，缺乏对调查数据中隐含的抽象行为模式的语义条件生成能力，需要开发能够同时捕捉统计结构和行为语义的合成方法

Method: 提出SemaPop框架，从个体调查记录中提取高层人物画像表示作为语义条件信号，采用Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP)作为主干网络，引入边缘正则化确保与目标人口边缘分布对齐

Result: SemaPop-GAN在生成性能上表现优异，与目标边缘分布和联合分布对齐更紧密，同时保持样本级可行性和语义条件下的多样性；消融研究证实了语义人物画像条件和架构设计对平衡边缘一致性和结构真实性的贡献

Conclusion: SemaPop-GAN通过有效的语义-统计信息融合实现了可控且可解释的人口合成，为开发集成个体行为语义与人口统计约束的生成式人口预测系统提供了模块化基础

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical component of individual-level socio-economic simulation, yet remains challenging due to the need to jointly represent statistical structure and latent behavioral semantics. Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统配置通常采用固定的大型模板或手动调整的启发式方法，导致脆弱行为和计算浪费，因为相同的繁琐配置同时应用于简单和困难的查询

Method: 将智能体配置建模为查询级决策问题，引入ARC（Agentic Resource & Configuration learner），使用强化学习学习轻量级分层策略，动态调整配置

Result: 在多个推理和工具增强问答基准测试中，学习到的策略始终优于强手工设计和其他基线方法，任务准确率提升高达25%，同时减少token和运行时间成本

Conclusion: 学习每个查询的智能体配置是"一刀切"设计的强大替代方案，能够实现更好的性能效率和成本效益

Abstract: Configuring LLM-based agent systems involves choosing workflows, tools, token budgets, and prompts from a large combinatorial design space, and is typically handled today by fixed large templates or hand-tuned heuristics. This leads to brittle behavior and unnecessary compute, since the same cumbersome configuration is often applied to both easy and hard input queries. We formulate agent configuration as a query-wise decision problem and introduce ARC (Agentic Resource & Configuration learner), which learns a light-weight hierarchical policy using reinforcement learning to dynamically tailor these configurations. Across multiple benchmarks spanning reasoning and tool-augmented question answering, the learned policy consistently outperforms strong hand-designed and other baselines, achieving up to 25% higher task accuracy while also reducing token and runtime costs. These results demonstrate that learning per-query agent configurations is a powerful alternative to "one size fits all" designs.

Motivation: 多智能体在动态、部分可观测环境中的协作需要通信来减少不确定性，但现有研究分散在不同范式，缺乏统一的分析框架来理解通信设计的核心要素和权衡。

Method: 采用"五个W"框架（谁与谁通信、通信什么、何时通信、为何通信）分析多智能体通信，系统梳理MARL、涌现语言和LLM三大范式的演变路径和设计模式。

Conclusion: 未来需要结合学习、语言和控制的混合系统，解决可扩展性和可解释性挑战，实现更强大的多智能体协作。通信设计的五个W框架为跨范式研究提供了统一的分析视角。

Abstract: Multi-agent sequential decision-making powers many real-world systems, from autonomous vehicles and robotics to collaborative AI assistants. In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.

TL;DR: MAPLE是一个完整的模态感知后训练生态系统，包含基准测试、策略优化框架和自适应调度，通过模态感知训练减少梯度方差，加速收敛并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL后训练方法将所有输入信号视为同等相关，忽略了不同任务实际需要的模态，导致梯度方差增大、收敛缓慢，且对现实世界中信号缺失、增加或重新加权的分布变化鲁棒性差。

Method: 1) MAPLE-bench：首个明确标注每个任务所需最小信号组合的基准测试；2) MAPO：模态感知策略优化框架，按模态需求对批次进行分层以减少异质组优势带来的梯度方差；3) 自适应加权和课程调度，平衡并优先处理更难的信号组合。

Result: MAPLE将单模态/多模态准确率差距缩小30.24%，收敛速度提高3.18倍，在现实减少信号访问情况下对所有模态组合保持稳定性。系统分析确立了MAPO的最佳训练策略。

Conclusion: MAPLE为部署就绪的多模态RL后训练提供了完整方案，通过模态感知训练显著提升了性能、收敛速度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal language models now integrate text, audio, and video for unified reasoning. Yet existing RL post-training pipelines treat all input signals as equally relevant, ignoring which modalities each task actually requires. This modality-blind training inflates policy-gradient variance, slows convergence, and degrades robustness to real-world distribution shifts where signals may be missing, added, or reweighted. We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations. MAPLE narrows uni/multi-modal accuracy gaps by 30.24%, converges 3.18x faster, and maintains stability across all modality combinations under realistic reduced signal access. MAPLE constitutes a complete recipe for deployment-ready multimodal RL post-training.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏透明度和可解释性，无法让LLM直接与原始组学数据交互进行推理。需要开发能够实现可审计、可解释且具有诊断信息的单细胞分析框架。

Method: 将细胞类型注释、发育轨迹重建和转录因子靶向等核心单细胞分析转化为逐步推理问题，让LLM在自然语言对话中直接检查单细胞数据并调用生物信息工具，支持迭代推理和修正。

Conclusion: scPilot通过将LLM基于原始组学数据，实现了可审计、可解释且具有诊断信息的单细胞分析，为生物医学研究提供了新的分析范式。

Abstract: We present scPilot, the first systematic framework to practice omics-native reasoning: a large language model (LLM) converses in natural language while directly inspecting single-cell RNA-seq data and on-demand bioinformatics tools. scPilot converts core single-cell analyses, i.e., cell-type annotation, developmental-trajectory reconstruction, and transcription-factor targeting, into step-by-step reasoning problems that the model must solve, justify, and, when needed, revise with new evidence.
  To measure progress, we release scBench, a suite of 9 expertly curated datasets and graders that faithfully evaluate the omics-native reasoning capability of scPilot w.r.t various LLMs. Experiments with o1 show that iterative omics-native reasoning lifts average accuracy by 11% for cell-type annotation and Gemini-2.5-Pro cuts trajectory graph-edit distance by 30% versus one-shot prompting, while generating transparent reasoning traces explain marker gene ambiguity and regulatory logic. By grounding LLMs in raw omics data, scPilot enables auditable, interpretable, and diagnostically informative single-cell analyses.

Method: 在HotpotQA数据集上对三个模型（Llama 3.1 70B、GPT-4o、Claude Sonnet 4.5）进行3,000次智能体运行实验，使用ReAct风格智能体，分析行为序列的差异性

Result: 智能体行为高度不一致：平均每10次运行产生2.0-4.2个不同的动作序列；行为不一致性与失败率强相关：一致性任务（≤2个独特路径）准确率80-92%，高度不一致任务（≥6个独特路径）准确率仅25-60%，差距达32-55个百分点；69%的分歧发生在第二步（第一个搜索查询）

Conclusion: LLM智能体在相同任务上表现出显著的行为不一致性，这种不一致性可预测任务失败，早期决策是主要分歧点，监控行为一致性可实现早期错误检测并提高智能体可靠性

Abstract: Run the same LLM agent on the same task twice: do you get the same behavior? We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs. More importantly, this variance predicts failure: tasks with consistent behavior ($\leq$2 unique paths) achieve 80--92% accuracy, while highly inconsistent tasks ($\geq$6 unique paths) achieve only 25--60%, a 32--55 percentage point gap depending on model. We trace variance to early decisions: 69% of divergence occurs at step 2, the first search query. Our results suggest that monitoring behavioral consistency during execution could enable early error detection and improve agent reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值方法（如有限元法）需要独立求解PDE家族中的每个实例，计算成本巨大；而机器学习PDE求解器虽然计算速度快，但缺乏可解释性，无法提供对科学洞察至关重要的解析表达式。

Method: 提出NMIPS框架：1) 使用多因子优化同时发现PDE的解析解；2) 设计仿射迁移方法，在PDE家族间迁移学习到的数学结构，避免从头求解每个PDE。

Result: 在多个案例上的实验结果表明，相比现有基线方法，NMIPS实现了高达约35.7%的准确率提升，同时提供可解释的解析解。

Conclusion: NMIPS框架成功解决了PDE家族求解中的计算效率和可解释性问题，通过神经辅助多任务符号求解器在保持解析解可解释性的同时显著提升了求解效率。

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is fundamental to numerous scientific and engineering disciplines. A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch. Experimental results across multiple cases demonstrate promising improvements over existing baselines, achieving up to a $\sim$35.7% increase in accuracy while providing interpretable analytical solutions.

TL;DR: MathSpatial是一个评估和改进多模态大语言模型空间推理能力的框架，包含基准测试、训练数据集和结构化推理方法，发现当前模型在空间推理方面存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在感知任务上表现良好，但在数学空间推理能力（解析和操作二维、三维关系）方面表现不佳，与人类95%以上的准确率相比，大多数领先模型甚至达不到60%。这种显著差距表明空间推理是当前模型的基本弱点。

Method: 提出了MathSpatial框架，包含三个组件：1) MathSpatial-Bench：包含2K个问题、3个类别和11个子类型的基准测试，旨在将推理难度与感知噪声分离；2) MathSpatial-Corpus：包含8K个已验证解决方案的额外训练数据集；3) MathSpatial-SRT：将推理建模为由三个原子操作（关联、约束、推断）组成的结构化轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，在MathSpatial上微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型实现了有竞争力的准确率，同时减少了25%的token使用。该框架首次提供了大规模资源，能够分离感知与推理，实现对多模态大语言模型中数学空间推理能力的精确测量和全面理解。

Conclusion: MathSpatial框架揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在空间推理方面的显著不足，并提供了系统性的评估和改进方法，为理解和提升模型的空间推理能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on perception-oriented tasks, yet their ability to perform mathematical spatial reasoning, defined as the capacity to parse and manipulate two- and three-dimensional relations, remains unclear. Humans easily solve textbook-style spatial reasoning problems with over 95\% accuracy, but we find that most leading MLLMs fail to reach even 60\% on the same tasks. This striking gap highlights spatial reasoning as a fundamental weakness of current models. To investigate this gap, we present MathSpatial, a unified framework for evaluating and improving spatial reasoning in MLLMs. MathSpatial includes three complementary components: (i) MathSpatial-Bench, a benchmark of 2K problems across three categories and eleven subtypes, designed to isolate reasoning difficulty from perceptual noise; (ii) MathSpatial-Corpus, a training dataset of 8K additional problems with verified solutions; and (iii) MathSpatial-SRT, which models reasoning as structured traces composed of three atomic operations--Correlate, Constrain, and Infer. Experiments show that fine-tuning Qwen2.5-VL-7B on MathSpatial achieves competitive accuracy while reducing tokens by 25\%. MathSpatial provides the first large-scale resource that disentangles perception from reasoning, enabling precise measurement and comprehensive understanding of mathematical spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的医疗领域大语言模型对齐范式，通过构建多维医疗对齐矩阵和统一优化机制，解决传统RLHF在医疗问答中的不适用性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习对齐方法（RLHF和基于可验证奖励的RL）在医疗领域存在根本性不匹配：RLHF依赖昂贵且难以反映医疗事实绝对正确性的偏好标注；基于可验证奖励的方法缺乏有效自动验证器且难以处理复杂临床情境。医疗对齐需要同时优化正确性、安全性和合规性，但多目标异质奖励信号容易导致尺度不匹配和优化冲突。

Method: 1. 构建整体多维医疗对齐矩阵，将对齐目标分解为四大类：基础能力、专家知识、在线反馈和格式规范；2. 在每个类别中建立可观察指标→可归因诊断→可优化奖励的闭环，提供细粒度监督信号；3. 提出统一优化机制：使用参考冻结归一化对齐奖励尺度，实施三因素自适应动态加权策略，实现面向弱点、风险优先、减少冗余的协同优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提范式在真实医疗场景评估中有效，为垂直领域的复杂对齐建立了新范式。

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一种稳健的医疗对齐范式，通过系统化的多维对齐矩阵和创新的优化机制，解决了医疗领域大语言模型对齐中的关键挑战，为垂直领域的复杂对齐提供了新思路。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning for large language model alignment has progressed rapidly in recent years, transferring these paradigms to high-stakes medical question answering reveals a fundamental paradigm mismatch. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback relies on preference annotations that are prohibitively expensive and often fail to reflect the absolute correctness of medical facts. Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm in real-world medical scenario evaluations, establishing a new paradigm for complex alignment in vertical domains.

TL;DR: PhyNiKCE是一个神经符号代理框架，通过分离神经规划与符号验证来解决LLM在CFD模拟中物理约束执行不可靠的问题，显著提升了配置准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的概率性本质难以强制执行CFD模拟所需的严格守恒定律和数值稳定性，纯语义RAG方法容易产生"上下文污染"，导致语言上合理但物理上无效的配置。

Method: 提出PhyNiKCE框架，将神经规划与符号验证解耦，使用符号知识引擎将模拟设置视为约束满足问题，通过确定性RAG引擎专门检索求解器、湍流模型和边界条件，刚性执行物理约束。

Result: 在OpenFOAM实验中对非教程CFD任务进行验证，相比最先进基线获得96%的相对改进，自主校正循环减少59%，LLM令牌消耗降低17%。

Conclusion: 神经生成与符号约束执行的解耦显著增强了鲁棒性和效率，该架构为更广泛的工业自动化中的可信人工智能提供了可扩展、可审计的范式。

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous agents for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), is critically limited by the probabilistic nature of Large Language Models (LLMs), which struggle to enforce the strict conservation laws and numerical stability required for physics-based simulations. Reliance on purely semantic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) often leads to "context poisoning," where agents generate linguistically plausible but physically invalid configurations due to a fundamental Semantic-Physical Disconnect. To bridge this gap, this work introduces PhyNiKCE (Physical and Numerical Knowledgeable Context Engineering), a neurosymbolic agentic framework for trustworthy engineering. Unlike standard black-box agents, PhyNiKCE decouples neural planning from symbolic validation. It employs a Symbolic Knowledge Engine that treats simulation setup as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem, rigidly enforcing physical constraints via a Deterministic RAG Engine with specialized retrieval strategies for solvers, turbulence models, and boundary conditions. Validated through rigorous OpenFOAM experiments on practical, non-tutorial CFD tasks using Gemini-2.5-Pro/Flash, PhyNiKCE demonstrates a 96% relative improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, by replacing trial-and-error with knowledge-driven initialization, the framework reduced autonomous self-correction loops by 59% while simultaneously lowering LLM token consumption by 17%. These results demonstrate that decoupling neural generation from symbolic constraint enforcement significantly enhances robustness and efficiency. While validated on CFD, this architecture offers a scalable, auditable paradigm for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in broader industrial automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Benchmark Health Index (BHI)框架，通过三个正交维度（能力区分度、抗饱和性、影响力）量化评估基准的健康状况，以解决当前LLM基准测试不可靠的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型快速发展，但评估基准变得越来越不可靠。分数膨胀和选择性报告削弱了标准基准的权威性，社区不确定哪些评估结果值得信任。

Method: 提出Benchmark Health Index (BHI)框架，从三个正交维度评估基准：1) 能力区分度：衡量基准区分模型性能的能力；2) 抗饱和性：估计基准在饱和前还有多少提升空间；3) 影响力：量化基准在学术和工业生态系统中的影响。从91个代表性模型的106个验证基准中提取数据进行分析。

Result: BHI是首个在宏观层面量化基准健康状况的框架，为基准选择提供了原则性基础，并支持下一代评估协议的动态生命周期管理。

Conclusion: BHI框架能够系统性地评估基准健康状况，解决当前评估基准不可靠的问题，为社区提供可信的基准选择依据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are advancing rapidly, yet the benchmarks used to measure this progress are becoming increasingly unreliable. Score inflation and selective reporting have eroded the authority of standard benchmarks, leaving the community uncertain about which evaluation results remain trustworthy. We introduce the Benchmark Health Index (BHI), a pure data-driven framework for auditing evaluation sets along three orthogonal and complementary axes: (1) Capability Discrimination, measuring how sharply a benchmark separates model performance beyond noise; (2) Anti-Saturation, estimating remaining headroom before ceiling effects erode resolution and thus the benchmark's expected longevity; and (3) Impact, quantifying influence across academic and industrial ecosystems via adoption breadth and practice-shaping power. By distilling 106 validated benchmarks from the technical reports of 91 representative models in 2025, we systematically characterize the evaluation landscape. BHI is the first framework to quantify benchmark health at a macro level, providing a principled basis for benchmark selection and enabling dynamic lifecycle management for next-generation evaluation protocols.

*Edward Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出"梯级塌陷"理论解释机器学习系统"正确但理由错误"的问题，通过"认知遗憾最小化"方法修正因果推理错误，实验证明在1360个因果陷阱场景中能恢复53-59%的顽固错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习系统常通过"捷径"获得高性能，但这些捷径在分布变化时会失效。作者发现这一病理有精确的因果起源：自回归训练无法区分关联P(Y|X)和干预P(Y|do(X))，导致"梯级塌陷"问题。

Method: 提出认知遗憾最小化(ERM)作为因果信念修正算子，满足AGM公设；构建三层架构，包括物理基础定理证明执行器独立性可实现有效do操作，ERM作为因果信念修正算子，以及故障模式分类法注入领域无关防护。

Result: 在6个前沿大语言模型的1360个因果陷阱场景实验中，梯级塌陷问题在推理增强模型中依然存在(GPT-5.2为3.7%)；可操控性呈现逆缩放现象；针对性ERM反馈能恢复53-59%的顽固错误，而结果级反馈则失败。

Conclusion: 论文建立了机器学习中因果推理错误的精确理论框架，提出了可证明有效的解决方案，为构建更鲁棒的AI系统提供了理论基础和实践方法，特别是在防止"正确但理由错误"的病理行为方面。

Abstract: Machine learning systems that are "right for the wrong reasons" achieve high performance through shortcuts that collapse under distributional shift. We show this pathology has a precise causal origin: autoregressive training provides no gradient signal to distinguish association P(Y|X) from intervention P(Y|do(X)), a failure we formalize as Rung Collapse. When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉理解方面取得显著进展，但在工程图纸理解中存在关键限制：结构盲区。现有像素驱动范式丢弃了推理所需的显式向量定义关系，导致无法捕捉拓扑和符号逻辑。

Method: 提出Vector-to-Graph（V2G）管道，将CAD图转换为属性图，其中节点表示组件，边编码连接性，使结构依赖关系显式化且可机器审计。

Result: 在电气合规检查的诊断基准测试中，V2G在所有错误类别上都获得大幅准确率提升，而领先的MLLMs仍接近随机水平。

Conclusion: 像素方法存在系统性不足，结构感知表示为多模态AI在工程领域的实际部署提供了可靠路径。作者发布了基准测试和实现以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable progress in visual understanding, yet they suffer from a critical limitation: structural blindness. Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains. To facilitate further research, we release our benchmark and implementation at https://github.com/gm-embodied/V2G-Audit.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ThinkRouter提出了一种推理时置信度感知的路由机制，在模型置信度低时路由到离散token空间进行显式推理，置信度高时路由到潜在空间进行隐式推理，以提高推理效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式推理方法在不同设置下效果不一，分析发现错误答案的推理轨迹包含更少的低置信度步骤，而多个低置信度思考替代方案聚合的软嵌入可能引入噪声，导致对不可靠推理轨迹的高置信度。

Method: 提出ThinkRouter推理时置信度感知路由机制：当模型置信度低时，路由到离散token空间进行显式推理；当置信度高时，路由到潜在空间进行隐式推理，避免高置信度和噪声问题。

Result: 在STEM推理和编码基准测试中，ThinkRouter在准确率上优于显式CoT、随机路由和隐式推理基线，平均Pass@1提升19.70分，同时减少生成长度达15.55%。

Conclusion: ThinkRouter能够校准显式CoT和隐式推理产生的错误，通过全局降低模型置信度来加速思考结束token的生成，实现高效准确的推理。

Abstract: Recent work explores latent reasoning to improve reasoning efficiency by replacing explicit reasoning trajectories with continuous representations in a latent space, yet its effectiveness varies across settings. Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.

Motivation: 现有模型融合方法主要依赖参数空间启发式方法，常导致严重干扰、泛化能力下降以及重复、不连贯输出等不稳定生成行为。

Method: SCF-RKL框架使用反向KL散度测量模型间功能差异，选择性融合互补参数，通过稀疏、分布感知的更新控制功能干扰。

Result: 在24个基准测试中（包括高级推理、一般推理与知识、指令遵循、安全性和视觉分类），SCF-RKL始终优于现有模型融合方法，保持强大的泛化能力和生成稳定性。

Conclusion: SCF-RKL通过显式控制功能干扰的稀疏互补融合，为模型融合提供了更有效和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a promising paradigm for composing the capabilities of large language models by directly operating in weight space, enabling the integration of specialized models without costly retraining. However, existing merging methods largely rely on parameter-space heuristics, which often introduce severe interference, leading to degraded generalization and unstable generation behaviors such as repetition and incoherent outputs. In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities. We evaluate SCF-RKL across a wide range of model scales and architectures, covering both reasoning-focused and instruction-tuned models. Extensive experiments on 24 benchmarks spanning advanced reasoning, general reasoning and knowledge, instruction following, and safety demonstrate, vision classification that SCF-RKL consistently outperforms existing model merging methods while maintaining strong generalization and generation stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型差异分析主要局限于比较基础模型与其微调版本，而新发布的LLM往往是新架构，需要跨架构方法才能使模型差异分析广泛应用。Crosscoders虽然能进行跨架构差异分析，但之前只应用于基础模型与微调版本的比较。

Method: 提出Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs)架构改进，专门设计用于更好隔离模型特有的特征。首次将crosscoders应用于跨架构模型差异分析，通过无监督方式识别模型间的行为差异。

Result: 成功无监督识别出多个模型的安全关键行为特征：Qwen3-8B和Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B中的中国共产党对齐特征、Llama3.1-8B-Instruct中的美国例外主义特征、GPT-OSS-20B中的版权拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明跨架构crosscoder模型差异分析是识别AI模型间有意义行为差异的有效方法，为建立更广泛适用的模型安全分析技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: Model diffing, the process of comparing models' internal representations to identify their differences, is a promising approach for uncovering safety-critical behaviors in new models. However, its application has so far been primarily focused on comparing a base model with its finetune. Since new LLM releases are often novel architectures, cross-architecture methods are essential to make model diffing widely applicable. Crosscoders are one solution capable of cross-architecture model diffing but have only ever been applied to base vs finetune comparisons. We provide the first application of crosscoders to cross-architecture model diffing and introduce Dedicated Feature Crosscoders (DFCs), an architectural modification designed to better isolate features unique to one model. Using this technique, we find in an unsupervised fashion features including Chinese Communist Party alignment in Qwen3-8B and Deepseek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, American exceptionalism in Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, and a copyright refusal mechanism in GPT-OSS-20B. Together, our results work towards establishing cross-architecture crosscoder model diffing as an effective method for identifying meaningful behavioral differences between AI models.

TL;DR: 提出了Text2GQL-Bench基准，包含178,184个(问题，查询)对，覆盖13个领域，用于评估自然语言到图查询语言的转换系统，发现LLMs在ISO-GQL生成上存在显著方言差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Text-to-GQL数据集在领域覆盖、支持的图查询语言和评估范围上有限，缺乏高质量基准数据集和系统评估方法，阻碍了Text-to-GQL系统的发展。

Method: 构建了Text2GQL-Bench基准，包含多GQL数据集和可扩展的构建框架，支持不同领域、问题抽象级别和GQLs；引入了综合评估方法，包括语法有效性、相似性、语义对齐和执行准确性。

Result: 发现ISO-GQL生成存在显著方言差距：强LLMs在零样本设置下执行准确性最多4%，3-shot提示提升到约50%，但语法有效性低于70%；微调的8B模型达到45.1%执行准确性和90.8%语法有效性。

Conclusion: Text2GQL-Bench为Text-to-GQL系统提供了全面评估基准，揭示了LLMs在图查询语言生成上的局限性，表明足够的ISO-GQL示例能显著提升性能。

Abstract: Graph models are fundamental to data analysis in domains rich with complex relationships. Text-to-Graph-Query-Language (Text-to-GQL) systems act as a translator, converting natural language into executable graph queries. This capability allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to directly analyze and manipulate graph data, posi-tioning them as powerful agent infrastructures for Graph Database Management System (GDBMS). Despite recent progress, existing datasets are often limited in domain coverage, supported graph query languages, or evaluation scope. The advancement of Text-to-GQL systems is hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets and evaluation methods to systematically compare model capabilities across different graph query languages and domains. In this work, we present Text2GQL-Bench, a unified Text-to-GQL benchmark designed to address these limitations. Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources. To support compre-hensive assessment, we introduce an evaluation method that goes beyond a single end-to-end metric by jointly reporting grammatical validity, similarity, semantic alignment, and execution accuracy. Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.

Result: 在三种代表性智能体类型上评估，AIR实现了检测、修复和根除成功率均超过90%。实验证实了AIR关键设计组件的必要性，展示了其及时性和适度开销，并证明LLM生成的规则在不同领域可以接近开发者编写规则的效果。

Conclusion: 事故响应作为提升智能体安全的一流机制既是可行的也是必要的。AIR框架为LLM智能体系统提供了完整的事故响应能力，填补了现有安全机制的空白。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed in practice across a wide range of autonomous applications. Yet current safety mechanisms for LLM agents focus almost exclusively on preventing failures in advance, providing limited capabilities for responding to, containing, or recovering from incidents after they inevitably arise. In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains. These results show that incident response is both feasible and essential as a first-class mechanism for improving agent safety.

TL;DR: TSR将测试时的搜索技术（如best-of-N、beam search）应用到训练时的轨迹生成阶段，通过树状搜索选择高分动作构建高质量轨迹，提升多轮强化学习的性能和稳定性，计算开销仅一次性增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮强化学习中，奖励通常稀疏或延迟，环境具有随机性，传统的轨迹采样方法容易导致探索不足和模式崩溃，影响学习效果。

Method: 提出TSR（Trajectory-Search Rollouts）方法，在训练时进行轻量级树状搜索，使用任务特定反馈选择高分动作构建高质量轨迹。具体实例化了best-of-N、beam search和浅层前瞻搜索，可与PPO、GRPO等优化器结合使用。

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和WebShop任务上，TSR配合PPO和GRPO实现了高达15%的性能提升，学习过程更加稳定，训练计算开销仅一次性增加。

Conclusion: TSR通过将搜索从推理时移到训练时的轨迹生成阶段，为多轮智能体学习提供了简单通用的增强机制，与现有框架和拒绝采样式选择方法互补。

Abstract: Advances in large language models (LLMs) are driving a shift toward using reinforcement learning (RL) to train agents from iterative, multi-turn interactions across tasks. However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback. This improves rollout quality and stabilizes learning while leaving the underlying optimization objective unchanged, making TSR optimizer-agnostic. We instantiate TSR with best-of-N, beam, and shallow lookahead search, and pair it with PPO and GRPO, achieving up to 15% performance gains and more stable learning on Sokoban, FrozenLake, and WebShop tasks at a one-time increase in training compute. By moving search from inference time to the rollout stage of training, TSR provides a simple and general mechanism for stronger multi-turn agent learning, complementary to existing frameworks and rejection-sampling-style selection methods.

TL;DR: 提出MaxExp和SSE两种方法，用于将物种分布模型的概率预测转换为二元存在-缺失地图，优于传统阈值方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型通常产生概率性出现预测，需要转换为二元存在-缺失地图用于生态推断和保护规划。但传统的二值化方法通常是启发式的，会显著扭曲物种丰度和群落组成的估计。

Method: 提出MaxExp决策驱动二值化框架，通过直接最大化选定的评估指标来选择最可能的物种组合。还提出Set Size Expectation (SSE)方法，基于预期物种丰富度预测组合。两种方法都不需要校准数据，且适用于多种评分指标。

Result: 在三个涵盖不同分类群、物种数量和性能指标的案例研究中，MaxExp始终匹配或超越广泛使用的阈值和校准方法，特别是在强类别不平衡和高稀有性情况下。SSE提供了一个更简单但具有竞争力的选择。

Conclusion: MaxExp和SSE方法为多物种SDM二值化提供了稳健、可重复的工具，能够改善物种丰度估计和群落组成预测。

Abstract: Species distribution models (SDMs) commonly produce probabilistic occurrence predictions that must be converted into binary presence-absence maps for ecological inference and conservation planning. However, this binarization step is typically heuristic and can substantially distort estimates of species prevalence and community composition. We present MaxExp, a decision-driven binarization framework that selects the most probable species assemblage by directly maximizing a chosen evaluation metric. MaxExp requires no calibration data and is flexible across several scores. We also introduce the Set Size Expectation (SSE) method, a computationally efficient alternative that predicts assemblages based on expected species richness. Using three case studies spanning diverse taxa, species counts, and performance metrics, we show that MaxExp consistently matches or surpasses widely used thresholding and calibration methods, especially under strong class imbalance and high rarity. SSE offers a simpler yet competitive option. Together, these methods provide robust, reproducible tools for multispecies SDM binarization.

TL;DR: RELATE是一个基于强化学习的端到端框架，统一了广告文本生成和性能对齐，通过多维度奖励机制直接优化转化指标和政策约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业系统采用两阶段范式（先生成候选文本，再与点击率等在线指标对齐），导致优化目标不一致和漏斗效率低下，限制了全局最优性。

Method: 提出RELATE框架，通过强化学习将生成和目标对齐统一在单一模型中。将性能指标和政策约束整合为多维度奖励，直接融入生成过程，特别关注超越点击信号的转化导向指标。

Result: 在大规模工业数据集上的实验表明，RELATE持续优于基线方法。在生产广告平台上的在线部署在严格政策约束下实现了点击转化率（CTCVR）的显著提升。

Conclusion: RELATE框架通过端到端的强化学习方法，有效解决了广告文本生成与性能对齐的分离问题，在现实应用中展示了鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: In online advertising, advertising text plays a critical role in attracting user engagement and driving advertiser value. Existing industrial systems typically follow a two-stage paradigm, where candidate texts are first generated and subsequently aligned with online performance metrics such as click-through rate(CTR). This separation often leads to misaligned optimization objectives and low funnel efficiency, limiting global optimality.
  To address these limitations, we propose RELATE, a reinforcement learning-based end-to-end framework that unifies generation and objective alignment within a single model. Instead of decoupling text generation from downstream metric alignment, RELATE integrates performance and compliance objectives directly into the generation process via policy learning. To better capture ultimate advertiser value beyond click-level signals, We incorporate conversion-oriented metrics into the objective and jointly model them with compliance constraints as multi-dimensional rewards, enabling the model to generate high-quality ad texts that improve conversion performance under policy constraints.
  Extensive experiments on large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate that RELATE consistently outperforms baselines. Furthermore, online deployment on a production advertising platform yields statistically significant improvements in click-through conversion rate(CTCVR) under strict policy constraints, validating the robustness and real-world effectiveness of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs能够通过推理和工具使用解决复杂任务，但将这些解决方案准确转化为结构化工作流仍然具有挑战性。现有方法在执行过程中构建工作流常因两个过程的相互干扰而导致不准确。

Method: 提出Execute-Summarize(ES)框架：1) 模型首先使用可用工具完成任务执行；2) 然后从执行轨迹独立重构结构化工作流。这种解耦设计避免了执行与构建过程的相互干扰。

Result: 在FlowBench基准测试中，该方法优于现有方法，为将自由形式的LLM推理转化为结构化工作流提供了可靠范式，显著提高了工作流准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ES框架通过解耦任务执行与工作流构建，有效解决了LLM工作流构建中的准确性问题，为结构化工作流生成提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs can solve complex tasks through reasoning and tool use, but accurately translating these solutions into structured workflows remains challenging. We model workflows as sequences of tool use and reformulate the problem as designing a mechanism that can both solve tasks and reliably construct workflows. Prior approaches that build workflows during execution often suffer from inaccuracies due to interference between the two processes. We propose an Execute-Summarize(ES) framework that decouples task execution from workflow construction: the model first completes the task using available tools, then independently reconstructs a structured workflow from execution traces. This separation improves workflow accuracy and robustness. We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.

TL;DR: LAVES是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，用于从教育问题生成高质量教学视频，通过分层架构和结构化编译实现低成本、高效率的视频生产。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端视频生成模型在需要严格逻辑和精确知识表示的教学场景中存在局限，现有方法存在程序保真度低、制作成本高、可控性有限等问题。

Method: 采用分层多智能体架构：编排智能体协调解决方案智能体（严谨问题求解）、插图智能体（生成可视化代码）、叙述智能体（教学脚本），通过质量门控、迭代批判机制和结构化编译实现自动化生产。

Result: 系统日吞吐量超过100万视频，相比行业标准方法成本降低95%以上，同时保持高接受率，实现了高质量教学视频的规模化生产。

Conclusion: LAVES通过多智能体协作和结构化编译方法，成功解决了教学视频生成中的逻辑严谨性、成本效益和可控性问题，为教育内容自动化生产提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent end-to-end video generation models demonstrate impressive performance in visually oriented content creation, they remain limited in scenarios that require strict logical rigor and precise knowledge representation, such as instructional and educational media. To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks. Rather than directly synthesizing pixels, the system constructs a structured executable video script that is deterministically compiled into synchronized visuals and narration using template-driven assembly rules, enabling fully automated end-to-end production without manual editing. In large-scale deployments, LAVES achieves a throughput exceeding one million videos per day, delivering over a 95% reduction in cost compared to current industry-standard approaches while maintaining a high acceptance rate.

TL;DR: 提出Min-$k$NN Distance方法检测RLVR训练污染，通过分析生成文本的多样性差异来区分RL训练中见过和未见的提示


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练使用奖励反馈微调模型，但训练数据未公开导致基准污染问题。传统基于概率的检测方法对RLVR无效，需要新的检测技术

Method: 提出Min-$k$NN Distance黑盒检测器：对给定提示采样多个补全，计算k个最小最近邻编辑距离的平均值，量化生成文本的多样性崩溃

Result: Min-$k$NN Distance能可靠区分RL训练中见过和未见的提示，在多个RLVR训练推理模型上优于现有成员推断和RL污染检测基线方法

Conclusion: RLVR训练导致独特的生成行为特征，Min-$k$NN Distance提供了一种简单有效的黑盒检测方法，无需访问参考模型或token概率

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is central to training modern reasoning models, but the undisclosed training data raises concerns about benchmark contamination. Unlike pretraining methods, which optimize models using token-level probabilities, RLVR fine-tunes models based on reward feedback from self-generated reasoning trajectories, making conventional likelihood-based detection methods less effective. We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances. Min-$k$NN Distance requires no access to the reference model or token probabilities. Experiments across multiple RLVR-trained reasoning models show that Min-$k$NN Distance reliably distinguishes RL-seen examples from unseen ones and outperforms existing membership inference and RL contamination detection baselines.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Hi-SAM：分层结构感知多模态推荐框架，通过解耦语义分词器和分层记忆锚点Transformer解决现有语义ID方法的两个关键问题，在冷启动和在线指标上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推荐中的语义ID方法存在两个主要问题：1）分词效果不佳，现有方法（如RQ-VAE）无法解耦跨模态共享语义和模态特定细节，导致冗余或坍缩；2）架构与数据不匹配，普通Transformer将语义ID视为扁平流，忽略了用户交互、物品和token的层次结构，扩展物品为多个token会放大长度和噪声，使注意力偏向局部细节而非整体语义。

Method: 提出Hi-SAM框架，包含两个核心设计：1）解耦语义分词器（DST）：通过几何感知对齐统一多模态，采用从粗到细的策略进行量化，共享码本提取共识，模态特定码本从残差中恢复细节，并通过互信息最小化强制解耦；2）分层记忆锚点Transformer（HMAT）：通过分层RoPE将位置编码拆分为物品间和物品内子空间以恢复层次结构，插入锚点token将物品压缩为紧凑记忆，为当前物品保留细节，同时仅通过压缩摘要访问历史信息。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验显示，相比最先进的基线方法有持续改进，尤其在冷启动场景下表现优异。在大规模社交平台部署服务数百万用户时，Hi-SAM在核心在线指标上实现了6.55%的提升。

Conclusion: Hi-SAM通过解耦语义分词和分层Transformer架构有效解决了多模态推荐中的语义ID问题，在离线实验和在线部署中都取得了显著效果，特别是在冷启动场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal recommendation has gained traction as items possess rich attributes like text and images. Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy. It inserts Anchor Tokens to condense items into compact memory, retaining details for the current item while accessing history only through compressed summaries. Experiments on real-world datasets show consistent improvements over SOTA baselines, especially in cold-start scenarios. Deployed on a large-scale social platform serving millions of users, Hi-SAM achieved a 6.55% gain in the core online metric.

TL;DR: 提出PuYun-LDM，一种用于高分辨率集合天气预报的潜在扩散模型，通过3D-MAE编码天气状态特征和变量感知掩码频率建模策略，提升潜在扩散能力，在短预报时效优于ENS，长时效保持相当性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统潜在扩散模型在高分辨率集合天气预报中存在扩散能力有限的问题。气象数据缺乏任务无关的基础模型和显式语义结构，无法应用VFM正则化。现有频率方法在多元气象数据的谱异质性下，采用同质假设导致正则化强度不均。

Method: 提出3D掩码自编码器(3D-MAE)编码天气状态演化特征作为扩散模型的额外条件，结合变量感知掩码频率建模(VA-MFM)策略，根据每个变量的谱能量分布自适应选择阈值，共同构成PuYun-LDM框架。

Result: PuYun-LDM在短预报时效优于ENS集合预报，长时效保持相当性能。可在单个NVIDIA H200 GPU上5分钟内生成15天全球预报（6小时时间分辨率），并能高效并行生成集合预报。

Conclusion: 通过3D-MAE和VA-MFM策略增强潜在扩散能力，PuYun-LDM为高分辨率集合天气预报提供了有效解决方案，在保持计算效率的同时提升了预报性能。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) suffer from limited diffusability in high-resolution (<=0.25°) ensemble weather forecasting, where diffusability characterizes how easily a latent data distribution can be modeled by a diffusion process. Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons. PuYun-LDM generates a 15-day global forecast with a 6-hour temporal resolution in five minutes on a single NVIDIA H200 GPU, while ensemble forecasts can be efficiently produced in parallel.

TL;DR: 提出轻量级框架，利用LLM内部隐藏状态进行序列长度预测，解决长尾分布导致的填充浪费问题，包含EGTP静态预测和PLP动态预测组件，在ForeLen基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM服务和强化学习采样中序列长度的长尾分布导致批量推理时过度填充，造成显著计算浪费。现有方法依赖辅助模型进行静态长度预测，但存在高开销、泛化能力差、无法处理随机"一对多"采样场景等问题。

Method: 提出轻量级框架，重用主模型内部隐藏状态进行高效长度预测。包含两个核心组件：1) 熵引导令牌池化(EGTP)，利用实时激活和令牌熵进行高精度静态预测；2) 渐进式长度预测(PLP)，在每个解码步骤动态估计剩余长度以处理随机生成。

Result: 构建并发布了ForeLen基准测试集，包含长序列、思维链和强化学习数据。EGTP在ForeLen上达到最先进精度，MAE比最佳基线降低29.16%。结合长度感知调度器，实现了显著的端到端吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为高效LLM推理提供了新的技术和评估基准，通过重用模型内部状态进行长度预测，有效减少了计算浪费，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: The long-tailed distribution of sequence lengths in LLM serving and reinforcement learning (RL) sampling causes significant computational waste due to excessive padding in batched inference. Existing methods rely on auxiliary models for static length prediction, but they incur high overhead, generalize poorly, and fail in stochastic "one-to-many" sampling scenarios. We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型经常出现对象幻觉问题，原因是深层网络中视觉特征和预训练文本表示相互交织，导致视觉信息被抑制

Method: 基于潜在空间几何，通过正交投影提取纯视觉信息向量，采用校准策略在抑制发生的精确深度进行稀疏干预

Result: 在标准基准测试中，REVIS将对象幻觉率降低了约19%，优于现有最优基线，同时保持通用推理能力

Conclusion: REVIS是一种无需训练的方法，通过重新激活被抑制的视觉信息，有效减少对象幻觉，计算成本低且保持模型原有能力

Abstract: Despite the advanced capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they frequently suffer from object hallucination. One reason is that visual features and pretrained textual representations often become intertwined in the deeper network layers. To address this, we propose REVIS, a training-free framework designed to explicitly re-activate this suppressed visual information. Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: ProtoT是一种基于原型向量的自回归语言模型架构，通过输入序列与原型之间的双向通信实现可解释性，在保持接近SOTA性能的同时提供线性计算复杂度。


<details>

Motivation: 当前最先进的语言模型虽然在某些领域超越人类，但其推理过程不透明，这削弱了对其输出的信任。自回归语言模型虽然能输出显式推理，但真正的推理过程是黑箱，存在欺骗和幻觉等风险。

Method: 提出原型变换器（ProtoT），基于原型（参数向量）的自回归语言模型架构，替代标准的基于自注意力的变换器。通过输入序列与原型之间的双向通信，使原型在训练中自动捕获可命名的概念。

Result: ProtoT在计算可扩展性上实现线性复杂度（vs 二次复杂度），在模型和数据规模上扩展良好，在文本生成和下游任务（GLUE）上表现良好。原型提供可解释的推理路径，允许有针对性的行为编辑。

Conclusion: ProtoT在接近最先进架构性能的同时，通过设计实现可解释性，为创建性能良好且可解释的自回归语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: While state-of-the-art language models (LMs) surpass the vast majority of humans in certain domains, their reasoning remains largely opaque, undermining trust in their output. Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. "woman") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.

Conclusion: Talk2DM成功为动态地图系统增加了自然语言查询和常识推理能力，展示了强大的泛化能力和实际应用潜力，为车路云协同自动驾驶系统提供了更人性化的人机交互界面。

Abstract: Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation. Our results reveal that Talk2DM, powered by Qwen3:8B, Gemma3:27B, and GPT-oss models, achieves over 93\% NLS query accuracy with an average response time of only 2-5 seconds, indicating strong practical potential.

TL;DR: 提出一个自适应AI委托框架，用于智能任务分解和委托，能够动态适应环境变化并处理意外故障


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务分解和委托方法依赖简单启发式，无法动态适应环境变化和稳健处理意外故障，限制了AI代理处理复杂任务的能力

Method: 提出自适应智能AI委托框架，包含任务分配决策序列，整合权限转移、责任、问责、角色边界规范、意图清晰性和信任建立机制

Result: 该框架适用于复杂委托网络中的人类和AI委托方与被委托方，旨在为新兴代理网络中的协议开发提供指导

Conclusion: 自适应智能委托框架能够解决现有方法的局限性，支持AI代理更有效地分解复杂任务并安全委托给其他AI代理和人类

Abstract: AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks, aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.

*Yifan Luo,Yang Zhan,Jiedong Jiang,Tianyang Liu,Mingrui Wu,Zhennan Zhou,Bin Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSAE是一种分层稀疏自编码器，通过联合学习多个SAE及其特征间的父子关系，从LLM中提取分层语义特征，比传统SAE更好地捕捉语言的内在层次结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）只能孤立地提取LLM中的单义特征，但大量证据表明LLM捕捉了自然语言的内在层次结构，特别是"特征分裂"现象表明这种结构是分层的。需要一种能够捕捉这种层次结构的方法。

Method: 提出分层稀疏自编码器（HSAE），联合学习一系列SAE及其特征间的父子关系。通过两种新机制增强父子特征的对齐：结构约束损失和随机特征扰动机制。

Result: 在不同LLM和层上的广泛实验表明，HSAE能够一致地恢复有语义意义的层次结构，得到定性案例研究和严格定量指标的支持。同时，HSAE在不同字典大小下保持了标准SAE的重建保真度和可解释性。

Conclusion: HSAE为发现和分析LLM表示中嵌入的多尺度概念结构提供了一个强大、可扩展的工具，能够更好地理解LLM如何组织和表示知识。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have proven effective for extracting monosemantic features from large language models (LLMs), yet these features are typically identified in isolation. However, broad evidence suggests that LLMs capture the intrinsic structure of natural language, where the phenomenon of "feature splitting" in particular indicates that such structure is hierarchical. To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics. At the same time, HSAE preserves the reconstruction fidelity and interpretability of standard SAEs across different dictionary sizes. Our work provides a powerful, scalable tool for discovering and analyzing the multi-scale conceptual structures embedded in LLM representations.

### [209] [When Should LLMs Be Less Specific? Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11908)
*Shani Goren,Ido Galil,Ran El-Yaniv*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出选择性抽象（SA）框架，让LLM在不确定时降低内容细节而非完全弃权，通过原子级选择性抽象分解响应为原子声明，用更高置信度的抽象替换不确定部分，在FactScore和LongFact-Objects基准上优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛使用但容易产生事实错误，现有不确定性估计机制采用"全有或全无"的弃权方式，在长文本生成中过于严格，会丢弃有价值信息。需要一种更灵活的方法来平衡可靠性和信息保留。

Method: 提出选择性抽象（SA）框架，通过选择性风险和覆盖度形式化。具体实现原子级选择性抽象：将响应分解为原子声明（短小、自包含的单个事实陈述），用更高置信度、更不具体的抽象替换不确定原子。开发端到端评估流程，将风险量化为事实正确性，用信息论方法测量保留信息。

Result: 在六个开源模型的FactScore和LongFact-Objects基准测试中，原子级SA始终优于现有基线，风险-覆盖度曲线下面积（AURC）比声明移除方法提升高达27.73%，表明降低特异性能在保留大部分原始含义的同时提高准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 选择性抽象框架提供了一种比传统弃权方法更优的解决方案，通过降低不确定内容的细节而非完全移除，实现了可靠性和信息保留的更好平衡，为LLM在需要高可靠性的应用场景中提供了实用工具。

Abstract: LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary "all-or-nothing" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.

TL;DR: AlphaPROBE：一种将alpha因子挖掘重构为有向无环图导航的新框架，通过贝叶斯因子检索器和DAG感知因子生成器实现全局进化拓扑利用，显著提升预测精度、收益稳定性和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化alpha因子挖掘方法存在局限：解耦因子生成将因子发现视为孤立事件，迭代因子进化只关注局部父子优化，两者都缺乏全局结构视角，导致冗余搜索和多样性受限。

Method: 提出AlphaPROBE框架，将因子池建模为动态互联的有向无环图（DAG），包含两个核心组件：1）贝叶斯因子检索器，通过后验概率模型平衡利用与探索，识别高潜力种子；2）DAG感知因子生成器，利用因子完整祖先轨迹进行上下文感知的非冗余优化。

Result: 在三个中国股票市场数据集上对8个竞争基线的实验表明，AlphaPROBE在预测精度、收益稳定性和训练效率方面均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 利用全局进化拓扑对于高效稳健的自动化alpha发现至关重要，AlphaPROBE通过DAG建模实现了更系统化的因子挖掘。

Abstract: Extracting signals through alpha factor mining is a fundamental challenge in quantitative finance. Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations. Extensive experiments on three major Chinese stock market datasets against 8 competitive baselines demonstrate that AlphaPROBE significantly gains enhanced performance in predictive accuracy, return stability and training efficiency. Our results confirm that leveraging global evolutionary topology is essential for efficient and robust automated alpha discovery. We have open-sourced our implementation at https://github.com/gta0804/AlphaPROBE.

TL;DR: MEME框架通过建模金融市场中竞争性投资叙事的演化生态系统，超越传统资产中心或市场中心方法，实现更稳健的投资组合构建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在量化金融中的应用主要采用资产中心范式（关注个股预测）或市场中心范式（关注投资组合分配），但都忽略了驱动市场运动的底层推理逻辑。需要一种能够捕捉市场动态演化逻辑的新视角。

Method: 提出MEME框架：1）多智能体提取模块将噪声数据转化为高质量投资论点；2）高斯混合模型在语义空间中识别潜在共识；3）时间评估和对齐机制跟踪不同市场条件下语义漂移和模式生命周期；4）优先考虑持久市场智慧而非短暂异常。

Result: 在2023-2025年三个异质性中国股票池上的实验表明，MEME持续优于7个SOTA基线。消融研究、敏感性分析、生命周期案例研究和成本分析验证了MEME识别和适应金融市场演化共识的能力。

Conclusion: MEME通过逻辑导向视角将金融市场建模为竞争性投资叙事（思维模式）的动态演化生态系统，能够更有效地捕捉市场动态并指导稳健的投资组合构建，在多个中国股票池中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in quantitative finance by processing vast unstructured data to emulate human-like analytical workflows. However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/gta0804/MEME.

TL;DR: Gaia2是一个用于评估LLM智能体在现实异步环境中的基准测试，引入独立于智能体行动的环境演化、时间约束、动态事件等挑战，支持细粒度动作级评估和强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多为静态或同步环境，无法评估智能体在现实异步环境中的表现，需要创建能模拟真实世界动态性、时间约束和不确定性的评估框架。

Method: 基于开源Agents Research Environments平台构建消费者环境，每个场景配备写入动作验证器，支持细粒度动作级评估和可验证奖励的强化学习。

Result: 评估显示没有模型在所有能力上占优：GPT-5最高得分42% pass@1但在时间敏感任务上失败，Claude-4 Sonnet在准确性和速度间权衡，Kimi-K2开源模型最佳21% pass@1。

Conclusion: Gaia2揭示了推理、效率、鲁棒性之间的基本权衡，暴露了"模拟到现实"差距的挑战，通过发布基准和ARE框架为社区提供开发实用智能体系统的灵活基础设施。

Abstract: We introduce Gaia2, a benchmark for evaluating large language model agents in realistic, asynchronous environments. Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.

TL;DR: 提出CSEval框架，利用语言模型评估生成医学图像与提示之间的临床语义对齐，弥补现有评估方法只关注图像真实性和多样性的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像生成在医学领域应用日益广泛，但现有评估方法主要关注图像真实性和多样性，无法评估生成图像是否反映预期的临床语义（如解剖位置和病理特征）。需要一种能评估临床语义对齐的方法来支持生成模型在医疗领域的安全应用。

Method: 提出临床语义评估器（CSEval）框架，利用语言模型评估生成图像与条件提示之间的临床语义对齐。该方法通过语言模型分析图像和文本之间的语义一致性，识别其他指标可能忽略的语义不一致问题。

Result: 实验表明CSEval能够识别其他指标忽略的语义不一致问题，并且与专家判断具有相关性。该框架为现有评估方法提供了可扩展且具有临床意义的补充。

Conclusion: CSEval为生成模型在医疗领域的评估提供了临床语义对齐的评估框架，支持生成模型在医疗领域的安全采用，是现有评估方法的重要补充。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.

Motivation: 现有研究虽然通过调整提示来增强推理，但这些设计大多基于直觉，缺乏对底层行为模式的系统分析。作者希望从行为模式角度研究模型推理行为如何塑造推理过程。

Method: 提出两种优化方法：1) InjectCorrect：通过模仿模型自身过去正确答案的行为模式来引导模型；2) InjectRLOpt：从历史行为模式数据中学习价值函数，通过提出的可靠性感知Softmax策略在推理时生成行为注入来引导推理过程。

Result: 实验表明两种方法都能在各种推理任务上提升模型性能，无需修改模型参数，分别获得最高5.34%和8.67%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 模型在回答特定类型问题时表现出自适应的推理行为分布，结构性地注入这些模式能显著影响推理过程和结果的质量。提出的两种无需参数更新的优化方法能有效提升推理性能。

Abstract: Reasoning can significantly enhance the performance of Large Language Models. While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.

TL;DR: DTAPP-IICR：一种面向大规模无人机机群预飞行规划的交付时间感知优先级规划方法，通过增量迭代冲突解决，在动态共享空域中实现高效可扩展的路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模无人机机群在动态共享空域中的预飞行规划面临重大挑战，包括临时禁飞区、异构车辆配置和严格交付期限。现有多智能体路径规划方法缺乏实际无人机交通管理所需的可扩展性和灵活性。

Method: 提出DTAPP-IICR框架：1）基于紧迫性对任务进行优先级排序生成初始解；2）使用SFIPP-ST（带软约束和时间约束的安全飞行间隔路径规划）计算往返轨迹；3）通过迭代大邻域搜索和几何冲突图高效解决剩余冲突；4）采用完整性保持的方向性剪枝技术加速3D搜索。

Result: 在包含临时禁飞区的基准测试中，DTAPP-IICR在最多1000架无人机的机群上实现接近100%的成功率，通过剪枝获得高达50%的运行时间减少，优于批量增强冲突搜索方法，在城市规模操作中成功扩展。

Conclusion: DTAPP-IICR为密集动态城市空域中的预飞行规划提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，在现实城市规模操作中表现出色，而其他基于优先级的方法在中等部署规模下就会失败。

Abstract: Preflight planning for large-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) fleets in dynamic, shared airspace presents significant challenges, including temporal No-Fly Zones (NFZs), heterogeneous vehicle profiles, and strict delivery deadlines. While Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) provides a formal framework, existing methods often lack the scalability and flexibility required for real-world Unmanned Traffic Management (UTM). We propose DTAPP-IICR: a Delivery-Time Aware Prioritized Planning method with Incremental and Iterative Conflict Resolution. Our framework first generates an initial solution by prioritizing missions based on urgency. Secondly, it computes roundtrip trajectories using SFIPP-ST, a novel 4D single-agent planner (Safe Flight Interval Path Planning with Soft and Temporal Constraints). SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context. Scaling successfully in realistic city-scale operations where other priority-based methods fail even at moderate deployments, DTAPP-IICR is positioned as a practical and scalable solution for preflight planning in dense, dynamic urban airspace.

TL;DR: LawThinker是一个自主法律研究智能体，采用探索-验证-记忆策略，在动态司法环境中通过验证中间推理步骤来提高法律推理的准确性和程序合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律推理方法缺乏验证中间推理步骤的机制，导致不适用法规引用等错误在推理链中传播而未被检测。法律推理不仅需要正确结果，还需要程序合规的推理过程。

Method: 提出LawThinker智能体，采用探索-验证-记忆策略。核心是在每个知识探索步骤后强制执行验证作为原子操作。DeepVerifier模块从知识准确性、事实-法律相关性和程序合规性三个维度检查每个检索结果，并使用记忆模块在长时任务中跨轮次复用知识。

Result: 在动态基准J1-EVAL上，LawThinker比直接推理方法提升24%，比基于工作流的方法提升11%，在过程导向指标上表现尤为突出。在三个静态基准上的评估进一步证实了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: LawThinker通过探索-验证-记忆策略和DeepVerifier模块，有效解决了法律推理中中间步骤验证不足的问题，在动态司法环境中显著提升了推理准确性和程序合规性。

Abstract: Legal reasoning requires not only correct outcomes but also procedurally compliant reasoning processes. However, existing methods lack mechanisms to verify intermediate reasoning steps, allowing errors such as inapplicable statute citations to propagate undetected through the reasoning chain. To address this, we propose LawThinker, an autonomous legal research agent that adopts an Explore-Verify-Memorize strategy for dynamic judicial environments. The core idea is to enforce verification as an atomic operation after every knowledge exploration step. A DeepVerifier module examines each retrieval result along three dimensions of knowledge accuracy, fact-law relevance, and procedural compliance, with a memory module for cross-round knowledge reuse in long-horizon tasks. Experiments on the dynamic benchmark J1-EVAL show that LawThinker achieves a 24% improvement over direct reasoning and an 11% gain over workflow-based methods, with particularly strong improvements on process-oriented metrics. Evaluations on three static benchmarks further confirm its generalization capability. The code is available at https://github.com/yxy-919/LawThinker-agent .

TL;DR: 将TRM中的Transformer块替换为Mamba-2混合算子，在保持参数数量相近的情况下，在ARC-AGI-1推理任务上提升了pass@2性能2%，证明SSM算子能在递归推理框架中保持推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索递归推理模型中算子选择问题：Mamba-2的状态空间递归本身就是一种迭代优化形式，但将其引入递归框架是否仍能保持推理能力？

Method: 将TRM中的Transformer块替换为Mamba-2混合算子，保持参数数量相近（6.83M vs 6.86M），在ARC-AGI-1任务上进行评估。

Result: Mamba-2混合算子将pass@2（官方指标）提升了2.0%（45.88% vs 43.88%），在更高K值下表现更优（pass@100提升4.75%），同时保持pass@1持平，表明候选覆盖范围改善。

Conclusion: Mamba-2混合算子能在递归框架中保持推理能力，确立了SSM基算子作为递归算子设计空间中的可行候选，为理解递归推理的最佳混合策略迈出第一步。

Abstract: Recent work on recursive reasoning models like TRM demonstrates that tiny networks (7M parameters) can achieve strong performance on abstract reasoning tasks through latent recursion -- iterative refinement in hidden representation space without emitting intermediate tokens. This raises a natural question about operator choice: Mamba-2's state space recurrence is itself a form of iterative refinement, making it a natural candidate for recursive reasoning -- but does introducing Mamba-2 into the recursive scaffold preserve reasoning capability? We investigate this by replacing the Transformer blocks in TRM with Mamba-2 hybrid operators while maintaining parameter parity (6.83M vs 6.86M parameters). On ARC-AGI-1, we find that the hybrid improves pass@2 (the official metric) by +2.0\% (45.88\% vs 43.88\%) and consistently outperforms at higher K values (+4.75\% at pass@100), whilst maintaining pass@1 parity. This suggests improved candidate coverage -- the model generates correct solutions more reliably -- with similar top-1 selection. Our results validate that Mamba-2 hybrid operators preserve reasoning capability within the recursive scaffold, establishing SSM-based operators as viable candidates in the recursive operator design space and taking a first step towards understanding the best mixing strategies for recursive reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出可微分模态逻辑（DML）和模态逻辑神经网络（MLNNs），通过神经符号方法从行为数据中学习信任网络、因果链和监管边界，用于多智能体系统的语义故障调试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体AI系统从简单聊天机器人发展为自主集群，调试语义故障需要推理知识、信念、因果关系和义务，这正是模态逻辑设计用来形式化的内容。但传统模态逻辑需要手动指定在真实系统中未知或动态的关系结构。

Method: 提出可微分模态逻辑（DML），通过模态逻辑神经网络（MLNNs）实现，使系统能够仅从行为数据中学习信任网络、因果链和监管边界。通过四种模态构建统一的神经符号调试框架：认知模态（信任谁）、时间模态（事件何时导致故障）、道义模态（允许什么行动）和信念模态（如何解释智能体置信度）。

Result: 在具体多智能体场景中演示了每种模态，从发现外交游戏中的欺骗联盟到检测LLM幻觉。逻辑矛盾成为可学习的优化目标。提供了可执行的Jupyter笔记本代码。

Conclusion: 为神经符号社区提供了关键贡献：1）可解释的学习结构，信任和因果关系是显式参数而非不透明嵌入；2）通过可微分公理进行知识注入，用稀疏数据指导学习；3）组合多模态推理，结合认知、时间和道义约束；4）实用的部署模式，用于监控、主动控制和多智能体系统通信。

Abstract: As multi-agent AI systems evolve from simple chatbots to autonomous swarms, debugging semantic failures requires reasoning about knowledge, belief, causality, and obligation, precisely what modal logic was designed to formalize. However, traditional modal logic requires manual specification of relationship structures that are unknown or dynamic in real systems. This tutorial demonstrates differentiable modal logic (DML), implemented via Modal Logical Neural Networks (MLNNs), enabling systems to learn trust networks, causal chains, and regulatory boundaries from behavioral data alone.
  We present a unified neurosymbolic debugging framework through four modalities: epistemic (who to trust), temporal (when events cause failures), deontic (what actions are permitted), and doxastic (how to interpret agent confidence). Each modality is demonstrated on concrete multi-agent scenarios, from discovering deceptive alliances in diplomacy games to detecting LLM hallucinations, with complete implementations showing how logical contradictions become learnable optimization objectives. Key contributions for the neurosymbolic community: (1) interpretable learned structures where trust and causality are explicit parameters, not opaque embeddings; (2) knowledge injection via differentiable axioms that guide learning with sparse data (3) compositional multi-modal reasoning that combines epistemic, temporal, and deontic constraints; and (4) practical deployment patterns for monitoring, active control and communication of multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: StateLM是一种新型基础模型，通过内部推理循环管理自身状态，让模型能够主动管理记忆工具（上下文修剪、文档索引、笔记等），从而突破固定上下文窗口的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型虽然拥有成熟的数据库和检索系统（类似哈利波特中的冥想盆），但缺乏主动操作这些系统的能力，只能被动接受手动设计的上下文作为记忆。这限制了模型在长文档处理、对话记忆等任务中的表现。

Method: 引入StateLM模型，赋予其内部推理循环来管理自身状态。为模型配备记忆工具套件（上下文修剪、文档索引、笔记等），并训练模型主动管理这些工具，学习动态构建自己的上下文。

Result: 在长文档QA任务中，StateLM在所有模型规模上都优于标准LLM；在聊天记忆任务中，获得10%-20%的绝对准确率提升；在深度研究任务BrowseComp-Plus上，StateLM达到52%准确率，而标准LLM仅约5%。

Conclusion: StateLM将LLM从被动预测器转变为状态感知的智能体，使推理成为一个有状态且可管理的过程，突破了固定上下文窗口的架构限制。

Abstract: In the world of Harry Potter, when Dumbledore's mind is overburdened, he extracts memories into a Pensieve to be revisited later. In the world of AI, while we possess the Pensieve-mature databases and retrieval systems, our models inexplicably lack the "wand" to operate it. They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools. By learning to dynamically engineering its own context, our model breaks free from the architectural prison of a fixed window. Experiments across various model sizes demonstrate StateLM's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. On long-document QA tasks, StateLMs consistently outperform standard LLMs across all model scales; on the chat memory task, they achieve absolute accuracy improvements of 10% to 20% over standard LLMs. On the deep research task BrowseComp-Plus, the performance gap becomes even more pronounced: StateLM achieves up to 52% accuracy, whereas standard LLM counterparts struggle around 5%. Ultimately, our approach shifts LLMs from passive predictors to state-aware agents where reasoning becomes a stateful and manageable process.

*Zewei Yu,Lirong Gao,Yuke Zhu,Bo Zheng,Sheng Guo,Haobo Wang,Junbo Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出ARLCP框架，通过自适应反射惩罚和长度协调惩罚，动态平衡推理效率与准确性，显著减少大推理模型的冗余思考步骤，在保持精度的同时大幅降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中常生成过长的思维链，包含大量重复自问和循环推理等冗余反思步骤，导致高令牌消耗、计算开销增加和延迟上升，但精度并未提升，尤其在较小模型中更为明显。问题复杂度增加会引发更多不必要的反思，反而降低准确性并增加令牌开销。

Method: 提出自适应反射与长度协调惩罚（ARLCP）强化学习框架，包含两个关键创新：1）自适应反射惩罚，动态削减不必要的反思步骤同时保留必要推理；2）根据问题估计复杂度校准的长度惩罚。通过协调这两种惩罚，鼓励模型生成更简洁有效的推理路径。

Result: 在五个数学推理基准上使用DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和7B模型评估，ARLCP在效率-准确性权衡上优于现有方法。1.5B模型平均响应长度减少53.1%，同时精度提升5.8%；7B模型长度减少35.0%，精度提升2.7%。

Conclusion: ARLCP框架能有效解决大型推理模型中过度反思问题，通过动态平衡推理效率与解决方案准确性，显著减少计算开销同时提升性能，为高效推理模型训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks by employing test-time scaling. However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain. The code is released at https://github.com/ZeweiYu1/ARLCP .

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用零样本时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）进行高等教育入学预测，引入机构运营条件指数（IOCI）和Google Trends需求代理，在数据稀疏环境下实现与传统方法相当的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大学面临财务压力需要准确的入学预测，但高等教育入学预测通常数据稀疏：年度序列短、受报告变化和制度转变影响。传统方法在短样本下不稳定，结构断裂影响外推准确性。

Method: 采用零样本TSFMs框架，引入泄漏安全的协变量集，创建机构运营条件指数（IOCI）作为可转移的制度协变量，结合Google Trends需求代理和稳定化特征工程，使用扩展窗口回溯测试和严格版本对齐。

Result: 协变量条件化的TSFMs在零样本设置下与传统基准方法表现相当，无需机构特定训练。性能差异因队列和模型而异，展示了在数据稀疏环境下TSFMs的有效性。

Conclusion: 零样本TSFMs结合IOCI和Google Trends代理为高等教育入学预测提供了有前景的解决方案，特别是在数据稀疏和存在制度转变的环境中，能够实现与传统方法相当的预测性能。

Abstract: Many universities face increasing financial pressure and rely on accurate forecasts of commencing enrolments. However, enrolment forecasting in higher education is often data-sparse; annual series are short and affected by reporting changes and regime shifts. Popular classical approaches can be unreliable, as parameter estimation and model selection are unstable with short samples, and structural breaks degrade extrapolation. Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering. Using an expanding-window backtest with strict vintage alignment, covariate-conditioned TSFMs perform on par with classical benchmarks without institution-specific training, with performance differences varying by cohort and model.

TL;DR: 提出Hadamard线性注意力(HLA)，通过哈达玛积计算相似度后应用非线性，比传统线性注意力能更好地近似softmax，在视频生成等大规模token场景中高效有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统线性注意力虽然计算效率高，但采用独立应用于输入的内核函数，只能实现低阶有理函数近似softmax，限制了其表达能力。需要一种既能保持计算效率又能更好近似标准softmax注意力的方法。

Method: 提出Hadamard线性注意力(HLA)：1) 不像传统线性注意力将非线性分别应用于查询和键，而是在计算完成对相似度后应用非线性；2) 采用哈达玛积计算相似度；3) 推导出类似标准线性注意力的高效计算方案，无需耗时的张量重塑操作。

Result: HLA能够实现更高阶的有理函数来近似softmax，在保持计算效率的同时提供更好的表达能力。应用于大规模视频生成扩散transformer模型时，在处理大量token的场景中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: HLA是一种新颖的线性注意力变体，通过相似度计算后应用非线性的方式，在保持计算效率的同时更好地近似标准softmax注意力，特别适合处理大规模token的应用场景。

Abstract: The attention mechanism is an important reason for the success of transformers. It relies on computing pairwise relations between tokens. To reduce the high computational cost of standard quadratic attention, linear attention has been proposed as an efficient approximation. It employs kernel functions that are applied independently to the inputs before the pairwise similarities are calculated. That allows for an efficient computational procedure which, however, amounts to a low-degree rational function approximating softmax.
  We propose Hadamard Linear Attention (HLA). Unlike previous works on linear attention, the nonlinearity in HLA is not applied separately to queries and keys, but, analogously to standard softmax attention, after the pairwise similarities have been computed. It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention. In contrast to other approaches, no time-consuming tensor reshaping is necessary to apply the proposed algorithm. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by applying it to a large diffusion transformer model for video generation, an application that involves very large amounts of tokens.

Motivation: 测试中性提示词是否会产生人口统计学上中性的输出，量化商业图像生成器中的性别和肤色偏见

Method: 使用Gemini Flash 2.5 Image和GPT Image 1.5生成3,200张照片级图像，采用混合颜色归一化、面部地标掩蔽和感知均匀肤色量化（MST、PERLA、Fitzpatrick量表）的严格分析流程

Result: 中性提示词产生高度极化的默认输出：两个模型都表现出强烈的"默认白人"偏见（>96%输出），但在性别上分歧明显：Gemini偏好女性呈现主体，GPT偏好肤色较浅的男性呈现主体

Conclusion: 中性提示词作为诊断探针而非中性指令，挑战了无标记语言会导致包容性表征的社会语言学假设，为审计算法视觉文化提供了稳健框架

Abstract: This study quantifies gender and skin-tone bias in two widely deployed commercial image generators - Gemini Flash 2.5 Image (NanoBanana) and GPT Image 1.5 - to test the assumption that neutral prompts yield demographically neutral outputs. We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.

TL;DR: 提出价值对齐税框架，衡量对齐干预如何影响整个价值系统，而不仅仅是目标价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有价值对齐研究通常静态描述价值关系，忽略了干预措施如何重塑整个价值系统。需要理解对齐压力下价值表达的动态变化

Method: 引入价值对齐税框架，使用基于Schwartz价值理论的受控场景-行动数据集，收集对齐前后的规范性判断，分析不同模型、价值和策略下的对齐效应

Result: 对齐通常导致价值间不均衡的结构性共变，这些效应在传统仅针对目标的评估中不可见，揭示了系统性的过程级对齐风险

Conclusion: 价值对齐税框架提供了理解LLM价值对齐动态的新视角，揭示了传统评估方法无法捕捉的系统性风险

Abstract: Existing work on value alignment typically characterizes value relations statically, ignoring how interventions - such as prompting, fine-tuning, or preference optimization - reshape the broader value system. We introduce the Value Alignment Tax (VAT), a framework that measures how alignment-induced changes propagate across interconnected values relative to achieved on-target gain. VAT captures the dynamics of value expression under alignment pressure. Using a controlled scenario-action dataset grounded in Schwartz value theory, we collect paired pre-post normative judgments and analyze alignment effects across models, values, and alignment strategies. Our results show that alignment often produces uneven, structured co-movement among values. These effects are invisible under conventional target-only evaluation, revealing systemic, process-level alignment risks and offering new insights into the dynamics of value alignment in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大模型全面评估成本急剧增加，从有限观测预测模型性能变得至关重要。现有统计方法难以应对模式变化、数据稀疏和缺乏解释性，而纯LLM方法仍不可靠。

Method: STAR框架结合数据驱动的统计期望与知识驱动的智能推理：1) 使用专门检索器获取外部知识，将语义特征嵌入约束概率矩阵分解(CPMF)生成带不确定性的统计期望；2) 基于期望违背理论(EVT)的推理模块通过族内分析、跨模型比较和可信度感知聚合来优化预测，提供可追溯的解释。

Result: 广泛实验表明，STAR在分数和排名指标上均优于所有基线方法，在极端稀疏条件下（每个测试模型仅1-2个观测分数）相比最强统计方法总得分提升14.46%。

Conclusion: STAR框架成功解决了大模型性能预测中的模式变化、数据稀疏和解释性不足问题，通过统计与推理的结合实现了准确、可解释的预测，为高效模型评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As comprehensive large model evaluation becomes prohibitively expensive, predicting model performance from limited observations has become essential. However, existing statistical methods struggle with pattern shifts, data sparsity, and lack of explanation, while pure LLM methods remain unreliable. We propose STAR, a framework that bridges data-driven STatistical expectations with knowledge-driven Agentic Reasoning. STAR leverages specialized retrievers to gather external knowledge and embeds semantic features into Constrained Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (CPMF) to generate statistical expectations with uncertainty. A reasoning module guided by Expectation Violation Theory (EVT) then refines predictions through intra-family analysis, cross-model comparison, and credibility-aware aggregation, producing adjustments with traceable explanations. Extensive experiments show that STAR consistently outperforms all baselines on both score-based and rank-based metrics, delivering a 14.46% gain in total score over the strongest statistical method under extreme sparsity, with only 1--2 observed scores per test model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统压缩方法难以充分利用复杂数据结构，现有深度学习方法依赖向量表示而掩盖token结构，需要更有效的无损压缩技术

Method: 使用强化学习训练T5语言模型，将数据压缩为token序列而非向量表示，通过离策略强化学习算法优化序列长度以减少冗余

Result: 相比传统压缩方法显著提高了压缩率，保持语义完整性，无需外部语法或世界知识，实现高效自适应数据压缩

Conclusion: 基于强化学习和语言模型的token序列压缩方法为各种应用提供了更强大实用的压缩解决方案，通过利用语言模型的潜在信息实现高效压缩

Abstract: Efficient lossless compression is essential for minimizing storage costs and transmission overhead while preserving data integrity. Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.

TL;DR: LLMs虽然在某些社会任务中表现良好，但缺乏真正的心理理论（ToM）——即关于心理状态如何导致行为的因果模型。研究发现LLMs在逻辑等价任务中失败，且行为预测与心理状态推断之间一致性低，表明其社会能力并非来自领域通用或一致的心理理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估LLMs在心理理论基准测试中的表现，但这些评估并未测试心理理论所假设的实际表征——即心理状态和行为的因果模型。本文旨在使用认知科学定义的心理理论来开发和测试新的评估框架。

Method: 采用认知科学为基础的心理理论定义，开发新的评估框架，专门测试LLMs是否拥有关于心理状态如何导致行为的连贯、领域通用且一致的模型。通过简单心理理论范式、逻辑等价任务以及行为预测与心理状态推断的一致性测试来评估。

Result: 研究发现：1）LLMs在简单心理理论范式中能够近似人类判断；2）但在逻辑等价任务中失败；3）行为预测与相应心理状态推断之间的一致性很低。这表明LLMs缺乏连贯、领域通用和一致的心理模型。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出的社会能力并非源于领域通用或一致的心理理论。它们虽然在某些社会任务中表现良好，但缺乏真正的心理理论所要求的因果模型表征，其成功更多是表面近似而非深层理解。

Abstract: Do Large Language Models (LLMs) possess a Theory of Mind (ToM)? Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional reasoning capabilities, and co-evolving paradigms have shown promising results in domains such as code and math. However, in scientific reasoning tasks, these models remain fragile due to unreliable solution evaluation and limited diversity in verification strategies. In this work, we propose Sci-CoE, a two-stage scientific co-evolving framework that enables models to self-evolve as both solver and verifier through a transition from sparse supervision to unsupervised learning. In the first stage, the model uses a small set of annotated data to establish fundamental correctness judgment anchors for the Verifier. In the second stage, we introduce a geometric reward mechanism that jointly considers consensus, reliability, and diversity, driving large-scale self-iteration on unlabeled data. Experiments on several general scientific benchmarks demonstrate that Sci-CoE enhances complex reasoning capabilities and exhibits strong scalability, facilitating the construction of more robust and diverse evaluation systems.

TL;DR: 本文扩展了量化布尔贝叶斯网络（QBBN），增加了否定/反向推理功能，并开发了自然语言解析器，结合LLM预处理和语法解析，实现了完整的逻辑推理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决之前QBBN模型的两个主要缺陷：缺乏否定/反向推理能力，以及没有自然语言解析器。旨在将形式语义学与Sutton的"苦涩教训"相结合，利用LLM消除形式NLP的标注瓶颈。

Method: 1. 推理：扩展QBBN，添加NEG因子强制P(x)+P(neg x)=1，通过反向lambda消息实现逆否推理；2. 语义：提出带类型标注谓词、模态量词的三层表达能力逻辑语言；3. 语法：开发类型槽语法，确定性编译句子为逻辑形式；4. 架构：LLM预处理→语法解析→LLM重排→QBBN推理。

Result: 推理引擎处理44/44测试用例（覆盖22种推理模式）；语法解析器33/33正确（零歧义）；LLM处理歧义（95%介词短语附着准确率），但无法直接生成结构化解析（12.4% UAS），证实语法分析的必要性。

Conclusion: 该工作成功结合了形式语义学与LLM的优势：LLM作为标注器消除形式NLP的瓶颈，QBBN作为验证器，实现了完整的自然语言逻辑推理系统。

Abstract: In previous work (Coppola, 2024) we introduced the Quantified Boolean Bayesian Network (QBBN), a logical graphical model that implements the forward fragment of natural deduction (Prawitz, 1965) as a probabilistic factor graph. That work left two gaps: no negation/backward reasoning, and no parser for natural language.
  This paper addresses both gaps across inference, semantics, and syntax. For inference, we extend the QBBN with NEG factors enforcing P(x) + P(neg x) = 1, enabling contrapositive reasoning (modus tollens) via backward lambda messages, completing Prawitz's simple elimination rules. The engine handles 44/44 test cases spanning 22 reasoning patterns. For semantics, we present a typed logical language with role-labeled predicates, modal quantifiers, and three tiers of expressiveness following Prawitz: first-order quantification, propositions as arguments, and predicate quantification via lambda abstraction. For syntax, we present a typed slot grammar that deterministically compiles sentences to logical form (33/33 correct, zero ambiguity). LLMs handle disambiguation (95% PP attachment accuracy) but cannot produce structured parses directly (12.4% UAS), confirming grammars are necessary. The architecture: LLM preprocesses, grammar parses, LLM reranks, QBBN infers.
  We argue this reconciles formal semantics with Sutton's "bitter lesson" (2019): LLMs eliminate the annotation bottleneck that killed formal NLP, serving as annotator while the QBBN serves as verifier. Code: https://github.com/gregorycoppola/world

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM知识蒸馏方法缺乏教学意识，将知识转移视为一次性数据合成和训练任务，而非系统性的学习过程。需要借鉴教育原理来改进蒸馏效果。

Result: 在LLaMA-3.1/3.2和Qwen2.5作为学生模型的实验中，IOA显著优于基线蒸馏方法。学生模型在DollyEval上保留教师性能的94.7%，参数量不到1/10。在复杂推理任务上表现突出：MATH提升19.2%，HumanEval提升22.3%。

Conclusion: IOA框架通过借鉴教育原理，实现了教学意识的知识蒸馏，显著提升了小模型从大模型学习的效果，特别是在复杂推理任务上表现优异，为高效AI系统部署提供了新方法。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation from Large Language Models (LLMs) to smaller models has emerged as a critical technique for deploying efficient AI systems. However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters. Our framework particularly excels in complex reasoning tasks, showing 19.2% improvement on MATH and 22.3% on HumanEval compared with state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: 通过针对分割任务特点设计的轻量级文本编码方案，可以在大幅降低计算和内存开销的同时，保持模型性能，为实际部署提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Vision-language segmentation models such as SAM3 enable flexible, prompt-driven visual grounding, but inherit large, general-purpose text encoders originally designed for open-ended language understanding. In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

Motivation: 尽管语音识别系统在标准基准测试中取得了低词错误率，但在真实世界部署中，特别是在高风险、短小的街道名称转录任务上表现不佳。这种失败模式对非英语母语者造成了不成比例的影响，可能导致导航错误等严重后果。

Method: 评估了15个来自OpenAI、Deepgram、Google和Microsoft的模型在语言多样化的美国说话者录音上的表现。为了缓解这一问题，引入了合成数据生成方法，使用开源文本转语音模型生成命名实体的多样化发音。使用不到1000个合成样本进行微调。

Result: 街道名称转录的平均错误率为44%。转录错误对所有说话者都造成系统性错误，但对非英语母语者的路由距离错误是英语母语者的两倍。通过合成数据微调，非英语母语者的街道名称转录准确率相对基础模型提高了近60%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语音系统基准性能与真实世界可靠性之间的关键差距，并展示了一条简单、可扩展的路径来减少高风险转录错误。合成数据生成方法能有效改善语音识别系统在多样化发音场景下的表现。

Abstract: Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.

TL;DR: KeplerAgent是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过模拟科学家的多步推理过程（先推断物理性质，再作为先验约束方程空间）来发现符号方程，比直接猜测的方法更准确、更鲁棒。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM系统直接从数据猜测方程，没有模拟科学家常用的多步推理过程：先推断物理性质（如对称性），再将其作为先验来约束候选方程空间。这限制了方程发现的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: KeplerAgent是一个智能体框架，协调基于物理的工具提取中间结构，并用这些结果配置符号回归引擎（如PySINDy和PySR），包括它们的函数库和结构约束。

Result: 在一系列物理方程基准测试中，KeplerAgent比LLM和传统基线方法获得了显著更高的符号准确性和对噪声数据更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过显式地遵循科学推理过程（先推断物理性质再约束方程空间），KeplerAgent在符号方程发现任务上超越了直接猜测的方法，展示了智能体框架在科学发现中的潜力。

Abstract: Explaining observed phenomena through symbolic, interpretable formulas is a fundamental goal of science. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for symbolic equation discovery, owing to their broad domain knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities. However, most existing LLM-based systems try to guess equations directly from data, without modeling the multi-step reasoning process that scientists often follow: first inferring physical properties such as symmetries, then using these as priors to restrict the space of candidate equations. We introduce KeplerAgent, an agentic framework that explicitly follows this scientific reasoning process. The agent coordinates physics-based tools to extract intermediate structure and uses these results to configure symbolic regression engines such as PySINDy and PySR, including their function libraries and structural constraints. Across a suite of physical equation benchmarks, KeplerAgent achieves substantially higher symbolic accuracy and greater robustness to noisy data than both LLM and traditional baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在AI代理应用中面临挑战：现实目标缺乏可验证奖励，强调开放式行为；多轮多步工具使用的RL研究不足；构建和维护可执行工具环境成本高，限制了规模和覆盖范围。

Method: CM2使用检查清单奖励替代可验证结果奖励，将每轮预期行为分解为细粒度二元标准，采用稀疏奖励分配但密集评估标准策略。在LLM模拟工具环境中进行训练，避免大规模工具集的重工程。

Result: 从8B基础模型开始，在8k示例RL数据集上训练，CM2比监督微调版本在tau^-Bench上提升8分，BFCL-V4上提升10分，ToolSandbox上提升12分。结果匹配甚至优于类似规模的开源基线，包括评判模型。

Conclusion: CM2提供了一个可扩展的配方，用于优化多轮多步工具使用代理，无需依赖可验证奖励，为AI代理的强化学习训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

TL;DR: CATTS：一种基于置信度的动态计算分配方法，用于多步智能体任务，通过投票不确定性决定何时增加计算，在提升性能的同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法在多步智能体任务中存在局限性：均匀增加每步计算在长视野环境中很快饱和，且小错误会在多步中累积。需要更智能的计算分配策略。

Method: CATTS（Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling）利用智能体自身投票分布的不确定性统计（熵和top-1/top-2边界）作为动态计算分配的信号，只在决策真正有争议时增加计算。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite和GoBrowse上，CATTS比React提升性能达9.1%，同时比均匀缩放少用2.3倍token，实现了效率和性能的双重提升。

Conclusion: 基于置信度的动态计算分配是有效的多步智能体优化策略，投票不确定性是可靠的决策信号，CATTS提供了一种高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dynamically allocating compute for multi-step agents. We first conduct an empirical study of inference-time scaling for web agents. We find that uniformly increasing per-step compute quickly saturates in long-horizon environments. We then investigate stronger aggregation strategies, including an LLM-based Arbiter that can outperform naive voting, but that can overrule high-consensus decisions. We show that uncertainty statistics derived from the agent's own vote distribution (entropy and top-1/top-2 margin) correlate with downstream success and provide a practical signal for dynamic compute allocation. Based on these findings, we introduce Confidence-Aware Test-Time Scaling (CATTS), which uses vote-derived uncertainty to allocate compute only when decisions are genuinely contentious. CATTS improves performance on WebArena-Lite and GoBrowse by up to 9.1% over React while using up to 2.3x fewer tokens than uniform scaling, providing both efficiency gains and an interpretable decision rule.
