TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于下一个令牌概率（NTPs）的轻量级幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统机器学习模型来检测视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成的文本中的幻觉问题，该方法计算效率高且性能可与强VLMs相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）产生的幻觉问题（视觉内容与生成文本之间的不匹配）严重影响了模型的可靠性。现有的检测方法通常使用相同或不同的VLM来评估生成输出，但这种方法计算密集且会增加模型延迟。

Method: 研究探索了一种高效的实时幻觉检测方法，通过训练传统ML模型基于VLM的下一个令牌概率（NTPs）信号。NTPs直接量化模型的不确定性，假设高不确定性（低NTP值）与幻觉强相关。方法还包括使用语言NTPs（仅将生成文本反馈给VLM计算）来增强检测性能。

Result: 基于1,400个人工标注的VLM生成语句数据集，实验结果表明NTP-based特征是有效的幻觉预测因子，使简单ML模型能达到与强VLMs相当的性能。将语言NTPs与VLM的幻觉预测分数集成到NTP-based模型中，性能优于单独使用VLMs或NTPs。

Conclusion: 这项研究为开发简单、轻量级的解决方案铺平了道路，能够有效增强VLMs的可靠性，通过利用模型内部的不确定性信号来实现高效的幻觉检测。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

### [2] [Quasi-Synthetic Riemannian Data Generation for Writer-Independent Offline Signature Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20420)
*Elias N. Zois,Moises Diaz,Salem Said,Miguel A. Ferrer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于黎曼几何的准合成数据生成框架，用于解决离线手写签名验证中的跨用户泛化问题，通过在SPD矩阵空间生成合成数据来训练度量学习模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在跨用户设置下具有挑战性，传统方法依赖真实数据集训练分类器，需要解决数据稀缺和泛化能力不足的问题

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何特性，通过Riemannian Gaussian Mixture模型识别合成作者中心，生成正负样本的合成SPD群体，构建度量学习框架

Result: 在两个包含西方和亚洲书写风格的流行签名数据集上实验，在跨数据集评估协议下实现了低错误率

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据对于独立于作者的签名验证系统的潜力

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

### [3] [Seedream 4.0: Toward Next-generation Multimodal Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20427)
*Team Seedream,Yunpeng Chen,Yu Gao,Lixue Gong,Meng Guo,Qiushan Guo,Zhiyao Guo,Xiaoxia Hou,Weilin Huang,Yixuan Huang,Xiaowen Jian,Huafeng Kuang,Zhichao Lai,Fanshi Li,Liang Li,Xiaochen Lian,Chao Liao,Liyang Liu,Wei Liu,Yanzuo Lu,Zhengxiong Luo,Tongtong Ou,Guang Shi,Yichun Shi,Shiqi Sun,Yu Tian,Zhi Tian,Peng Wang,Rui Wang,Xun Wang,Ye Wang,Guofeng Wu,Jie Wu,Wenxu Wu,Yonghui Wu,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Shuang Xu,Xin Yan,Ceyuan Yang,Jianchao Yang,Zhonghua Zhai,Chenlin Zhang,Heng Zhang,Qi Zhang,Xinyu Zhang,Yuwei Zhang,Shijia Zhao,Wenliang Zhao,Wenjia Zhu*

TL;DR: Seedream 4.0是一个高效的多模态图像生成系统，统一了文本到图像合成、图像编辑和多图像组合功能，采用高效的扩散变换器和优化的VAE实现快速高分辨率图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将传统的文本到图像系统扩展为更交互式和多维度的创意工具，推动生成式AI在创意和专业应用中的边界。

Method: 开发高效的扩散变换器结合强大的VAE，减少图像令牌数量；采用多模态后训练联合训练T2I和图像编辑任务；集成对抗蒸馏、分布匹配、量化和推测解码进行推理加速。

Result: 在生成2K图像时推理时间可达1.8秒，在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平，在复杂任务中表现出卓越的多模态能力。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更具交互性和多维度的创意工具，推动了生成式AI在创意和专业应用中的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

### [4] [A Contrastive Learning Framework for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20474)
*Samia Saeed,Khuram Naveed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对比学习的半监督框架，用于乳腺癌检测，在有限标注数据情况下实现96.7%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测至关重要。深度学习虽然有效但需要大量标注数据，而医学图像标注数据稀缺，因此需要开发在小标注数据集上表现优异的方法

Method: 使用Resnet-50在对比学习框架下进行半监督训练，利用大量未标注乳腺X光片数据，通过相似性指数和各种数据增强技术提升性能，最后在小规模标注数据上微调模型

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最优方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决医学图像标注数据不足的问题，在乳腺癌早期检测中表现出色，为计算机辅助诊断系统提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

*Simon Baeuerle,Pratik Khanna,Nils Friederich,Angelo Jovin Yamachui Sitcheu,Damir Shakirov,Andreas Steimer,Ralf Mikut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文测试了多个基础模型在工业图像质量检测中的应用，发现这些模型在公开数据集上表现良好，但在真实工业数据上全部失败。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在文本和图像处理任务中表现出色，具有零样本泛化能力，可能适用于系列制造中的自动化质量检测，从而减少繁琐的标注工作。

Method: 在自定义的真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新的基础模型。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上都失败了，而相同的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在工业质量检测应用中存在局限性，不能直接替代监督式AI模型，需要进一步研究以适应真实工业场景。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

*Jing Li,Oskar Bartosz,Chengyu Wang,Michal Wnuczynski,Dilshan Godaliyadda,Michael Polley*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出通用神经空间（NS）框架，通过编码器-解码器架构预计算跨视觉和成像任务的特征，使多个下游AI模块共享同一特征空间，减少冗余并提高跨域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型多为特定高精度任务定制，对于需要执行一系列模块化任务的应用效率低下，因为每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 使用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，学习具有变换感知和泛化能力的表示，支持多个视觉任务在同一特征空间中执行。

Result: 实验证明，去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等成像和视觉模块可以在NS中高效执行。

Conclusion: 该架构减少了冗余，提高了跨域泛化能力，为高效的多任务视觉流水线奠定了基础，且相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，硬件适应性更广。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究如何在边缘摄像头系统中选择最有用的训练图像，以在保持低传输成本的同时最大化模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘摄像头系统需要定期更新模型，但受限于计算资源和传输成本，需要选择最有价值的训练数据。

Method: 采用高置信度流式策略与基于多样性的方法相结合，选择训练图像。

Result: 在相似训练负载下，该方法能够以最少的数据库查询产生高质量模型。

Conclusion: 高置信度流式策略与多样性方法的结合是边缘设备模型训练的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge camera-based systems are continuously expanding, facing ever-evolving
environments that require regular model updates. In practice, complex teacher
models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to
maximize model quality while keeping transmission costs low. Our work shows
that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence
stream-based strategy coupled with a diversity-based approach produces a
high-quality model with minimal dataset queries.

### [8] [InstructVTON: Optimal Auto-Masking and Natural-Language-Guided Interactive Style Control for Inpainting-Based Virtual Try-On](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20524)
*Julien Han,Shuwen Qiu,Qi Li,Xingzi Xu,Mehmet Saygin Seyfioglu,Kavosh Asadi,Karim Bouyarmane*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstructVTON是一个基于指令的交互式虚拟试穿系统，通过自然语言指导实现对单件或多件服装的细粒度复杂样式控制，无需手动绘制精确遮罩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于遮罩的虚拟试穿方法需要用户手动绘制精确的二进制遮罩，这需要专业知识且在某些复杂场景下无法实现（如卷起袖子等样式变化）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型和图像分割模型自动生成二进制遮罩，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本样式指令，与现有虚拟试穿模型协同工作。

Result: 系统能够实现现有方法无法完成的复杂试穿场景，达到最先进的样式控制效果。

Conclusion: InstructVTON简化了用户体验，实现了更灵活和复杂的虚拟试穿控制，与现有模型具有良好的互操作性。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepAFRNet是一个深度学习模型，用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上针对三个难度级别实现了高准确率（96.7%-99.54%），但阈值选择对性能影响巨大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指纹识别在边境控制、法医和财政准入等应用中面临挑战，攻击者可能故意修改脊线模式以逃避检测，因此需要能够识别被篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集上评估三个难度级别（Easy、Medium、Hard）。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别上的准确率分别为96.7%、98.76%和99.54%。阈值敏感性研究表明，将阈值从0.92放宽到0.72会导致准确率急剧下降至7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet使用真实篡改样本并报告逐级指标，解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于对安全性和识别弹性都至关重要的实际部署。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

Motivation: 利用自监督ViT模型的注意力图作为像素级显著度分数，为机器人操作提供语义线索

Method: 从DINOv2提取注意力图，将其提升到3D体素网格中，并集成到行为克隆策略中

Result: 在RLBench双手基准测试中，平均绝对提升8.2%，相对增益21.9%

Conclusion: 注意力引导的特征化方法能显著提升基于体素的机器人操作策略性能

Abstract: We investigate the integration of attention maps from a pre-trained Vision
Transformer into voxel representations to enhance bimanual robotic
manipulation. Specifically, we extract attention maps from DINOv2, a
self-supervised ViT model, and interpret them as pixel-level saliency scores
over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究对YOLO和RT-DETR系列共36个模型变体在蓝莓检测任务上进行了基准测试，使用包含85,879个标注实例的新数据集，并通过半监督学习进一步提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然环境中蓝莓检测面临光照变化、遮挡和运动模糊等挑战，需要开发能够在实际场景中平衡精度、速度和内存需求的实时目标检测模型。

Method: 使用新构建的蓝莓数据集评估YOLO(v8-v12)和RT-DETR(v1-v2)系列模型，并采用无偏均值教师半监督学习方法在1,035张未标注图像上进行微调。

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50；半监督学习后RT-DETR-v2-X最佳性能提升至94.8% mAP@50。

Conclusion: 中等规模模型在精度和速度间达到良好平衡，半监督学习能进一步提升性能，但需要更深入研究以充分利用跨域未标注数据。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种轻量级的感兴趣区域(ROI)增强策略，用于提升乳腺X光片分类性能，在Mini-DDSM数据集上验证了该方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查对早期检测和降低死亡率至关重要，但现有深度学习模型受限于低分辨率数据集和小样本量，性能有待提升。

Method: 在训练过程中，以概率方式用预计算的、无标签的边界框库中随机采样的ROI裁剪替换完整图像，可选添加抖动以增加变异性，推理时成本保持不变。

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强(最佳参数：p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10)带来了适度的平均ROC-AUC提升，但性能在不同折叠间有变化；PR-AUC基本持平或略有下降。

Conclusion: 简单的、以数据为中心的ROI策略可以在不增加额外标签或架构修改的情况下，在受限环境中增强乳腺X光分类性能。

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出利用镜面反射作为辅助视图来构建虚拟相机，实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化3D重建过程并提高鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常环境中常见的镜面反射可以提供立体信息，通过将反射视为辅助视图，可以在单次拍摄中获得多视角信息，简化3D重建的成像过程。

Method: 设计物理有效的虚拟相机变换，直接生成虚拟视图像素；提出对称感知损失来优化姿态估计；框架可自然扩展到动态场景。

Result: 提供了包含16个Blender场景的合成数据集进行定量评估，在真实世界和合成数据上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从单张包含镜面反射的图像实现鲁棒的3D重建，特别适用于动态场景的逐帧几何恢复。

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对于分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像有细节但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 提出FacadeTrack框架：链接全景视频到地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用一阶段规则和两阶段决策策略（感知与保守推理分离）。

Result: 在两个飓风Helene后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F1分数0.848；一阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F1分数0.822。中间属性和空间诊断揭示错误来源。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，通过质量控制的针对性改进提升评估准确性。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

*Yiling Yun,Hongjing Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨人类如何通过简单移动形状识别社交互动，发现语义表征对视觉特征具有补充作用，其中基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是了解人类在识别社交互动时使用的语义表征如何补充视觉特征，揭示社会感知的认知机制。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记移动形状动画的印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社交互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 人类反应呈分布状态；语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息；基于动词的嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社会感知反映了社交互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Conclusion: EGS框架通过旋转不变特征提取和全局-局部一致性增强，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的跨域泛化能力

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Conclusion: 提出的双路径边缘网络为精确红外小目标检测提供了有前景的解决方案，通过统一框架实现了结构语义和边缘精炼的有效结合。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Motivation: 现有的陨石坑导航技术主要针对短时、垂直视角的着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏图像、倾斜视角和变化光照条件的挑战，需要开发新的导航方案。

Method: STELLA整合了基于Mask R-CNN的陨石坑检测器、无描述符的陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒的透视n点姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端。

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上的实验表明，STELLA在广泛视角、光照条件和月球纬度范围内平均保持米级位置精度和亚度级姿态精度。

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下对陨石坑导航进行全面评估，为未来任务提供了操作条件的参考依据。

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Method: 系统研究对齐现象，分析网络层级的对齐变化，测试对语义变化的敏感性，进行多对多图像-文本匹配的人类偏好实验。

Result: 对齐在中后期层达到峰值，对纯外观变化稳健但对语义变化敏感；人类偏好与模型嵌入空间一致；示例平均增强而非模糊对齐。

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于共享语义代码，与人类判断对齐，且通过示例聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化对象插入任务中存在几何控制不足和风格不一致的问题，且需要大量训练

Method: 将2D对象转换为3D，在3D层面进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现几何、风格和内容控制

Result: 能够生成几何可控、风格一致的编辑图像，无需额外训练

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过3D几何信息有效解决了对象插入中的几何控制和风格一致性问题

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

Result: 在Fundus、Polyp和SCGM等真实医学图像分割数据集上的广泛实验表明，DAC框架具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG场景下的挑战，为医学图像分割中的领域泛化问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

TL;DR: DEIMv2是DEIM框架的扩展版本，通过集成DINOv3特征和引入空间调谐适配器(STA)，在多个模型尺寸上实现了优越的性能-成本平衡，在目标检测任务中建立了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了进一步提升实时DETR模型的性能，同时覆盖从GPU到移动设备的多样化部署场景，需要开发一个能够适应不同资源约束的统一框架。

Method: 对于X、L、M、S变体采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，并引入空间调谐适配器(STA)将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；对于超轻量模型采用HGNetv2并进行深度和宽度剪枝，配合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Result: DEIMv2-X达到57.8 AP仅需50.3百万参数；DEIMv2-S是首个参数少于1000万但AP超过50的模型(50.9 AP)；DEIMv2-Pico仅1.5百万参数达到38.5 AP，性能与参数多50%的YOLOv10-Nano相当。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一的设计在不同模型尺寸上实现了卓越的性能-成本权衡，为目标检测领域建立了新的技术标杆，特别是在轻量级模型方面表现突出。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

TL;DR: 提出了DAC-LoRA框架，将对抗训练集成到参数高效微调中，通过动态对抗课程提升视觉语言模型的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在关键应用中易受对抗攻击，而现有的参数高效微调方法无法有效解决这一问题，CLIP作为基础模型的安全漏洞会传播到整个多模态AI生态系统

Method: 基于一阶平稳条件和TRADES损失，设计动态对抗课程，逐步增加攻击难度，可集成到标准PEFT流程中

Result: 显著提升对抗鲁棒性，同时不显著损害干净数据的准确率

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA是一种有效、轻量且广泛适用的方法，可增强视觉语言模型的安全性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

*Jianhan Wu,Xiaoyang Qu,Zhangcheng Huang,Jianzong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为FedDSPG的新方法，通过生成式视角处理联邦领域泛化问题，利用领域特定软提示生成来提升模型在未知领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的联邦领域泛化方法存在提示多样性有限且忽略未知领域信息的问题，需要一种更有效的方法来应对领域偏移挑战。

Method: FedDSPG方法在训练阶段为每个领域引入领域特定软提示，将内容和领域知识整合到客户端生成模型中；在推理阶段利用生成器获取未见目标领域的软提示。

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法在联邦领域泛化任务中优于现有强基线，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 从生成式视角提出的FedDSPG方法有效解决了联邦学习中领域泛化问题，通过领域特定软提示生成显著提升了模型在未知领域的适应能力。

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LumbarCLIP是一个新颖的多模态框架，利用对比语言-图像预训练技术将腰椎MRI扫描与放射学描述对齐，在腰椎疾病分类任务上达到95.00%的准确率和94.75%的F1分数。

Conclusion: LumbarCLIP为自动化肌肉骨骼诊断和临床决策支持提供了有前景的基础。

Abstract: Low back pain affects millions worldwide, driving the need for robust
diagnostic models that can jointly analyze complex medical images and
accompanying text reports. We present LumbarCLIP, a novel multimodal framework
that leverages contrastive language-image pretraining to align lumbar spine MRI
scans with corresponding radiological descriptions. Built upon a curated
dataset containing axial MRI views paired with expert-written reports,
LumbarCLIP integrates vision encoders (ResNet-50, Vision Transformer, Swin
Transformer) with a BERT-based text encoder to extract dense representations.
These are projected into a shared embedding space via learnable projection
heads, configurable as linear or non-linear, and normalized to facilitate
stable contrastive training using a soft CLIP loss. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on downstream classification, reaching up to
95.00% accuracy and 94.75% F1-score on the test set, despite inherent class
imbalance. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate that linear projection heads
yield more effective cross-modal alignment than non-linear variants. LumbarCLIP
offers a promising foundation for automated musculoskeletal diagnosis and
clinical decision support.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PoisonVID是首个针对VideoLLMs中提示引导采样策略的黑盒中毒攻击，通过闭环优化策略在三个先进VideoLLMs上实现82%-99%的攻击成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VideoLLMs的视频理解能力不断提升，但之前采样策略的漏洞已被发现，而提示引导采样策略的安全性尚未被探索

Method: 采用闭环优化策略，通过从有害描述构建的描述集指导，迭代优化通用扰动来抑制有害帧相关性分数，利用影子VideoLLM和轻量级语言模型GPT-4o-mini

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLMs上全面评估，PoisonVID达到82%-99%的攻击成功率

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了为VideoLLMs开发未来先进采样策略的重要性

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GoR是一种新颖的可学习正则化方法，通过仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，自适应地平衡任务特定和知识蒸馏目标，解决了量化感知训练中梯度冲突问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，存在异质梯度幅度问题，影响小量化模型的性能。

Method: 提出Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，使用两个可训练参数动态调整损失权重；同时引入QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架，利用多个异构教师模型。

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务上，GoR一致优于最先进的QAT-KD方法，在低功耗边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率。

Conclusion: GoR为量化模型压缩提供了稳健解决方案，在最优条件下甚至能超越全精度模型，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估在植物识别系统中，使用大规模但含有标签错误的网络数据是否能够与专家验证的小规模高质量数据竞争

Method: 创建来自Pl@ntNet移动应用的测试数据集，比较基于网络收集的噪声训练数据和专家验证的干净训练数据两种策略

Result: 挑战赛评估了不同研究组的方法和系统性能

Conclusion: 该挑战是迈向能够识别10,000种植物的自动化植物识别系统的重要里程碑

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: 本文提出TasselNetV4模型，将植物计数从物种特定计数转向跨物种计数，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和CAC的提取-匹配范式，在跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物具有生物多样性且新品种不断涌现，无法为所有物种构建依赖物种的计数模型。现有CAC和开放世界检测模型对非刚性植物结构计数效果不佳，需要重新思考植物计数的问题表述。

Method: 基于普通视觉变换器构建TasselNetV4，结合TasselNet的局部计数思想和CAC的提取-匹配范式，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia两个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4不仅实现了优越的计数性能，还具有高效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，为农业应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

TL;DR: 提出一种新型半监督模型，通过可微分生物标志物拓扑引擎确保视网膜OCT图像中病变和层分割的解剖学正确性，实现层与病变的双向交互学习，并在公开和内部数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜OCT分割中常产生解剖学上不合理的结果，无法有效建模层-病变相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，强制解剖学正确的病变和层分割；采用解耦表示学习分离空间和风格因素；利用未标记和部分标记数据集进行联合学习。

Result: 在公开和内部OCT扫描数据集上评估，模型在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，并能使用部分标注数据将层分割泛化到病理案例。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中使用解剖约束进行准确、鲁棒且可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Motivation: 该挑战赛旨在评估在接近真实世界生物多样性监测条件下的大规模植物识别方法，特别是解决开放集识别问题，即系统需要处理训练集中未出现过的未知植物种类。

Method: 基于包含110,000多张图像、涵盖1,000种西欧植物的数据集，采用开放集识别框架进行评估，要求系统不仅能够对已知类别进行分类，还要能够自动拒绝未知类别的错误分类。

Conclusion: LifeCLEF 2016挑战赛为大规模植物识别和开放集识别问题提供了有价值的资源和评估标准，推动了该领域的研究进展。

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中图像描述包含过多无关噪声，以及LLMs对VQA任务理解不足导致的推理能力受限问题。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型生成图像描述，通过上下文示例生成、总结和重排描述来排除无关信息，增强LLMs对图像和问题的理解。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率，基于6.7B参数的LLM。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过caption-rerank过程有效提升了LLMs在KB-VQA任务中的推理能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

*Jiabei Zhang,Qi Wang,Siyu Wu,Du Chen,Tianhe Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优秀的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，这种不一致在对抗训练下更加明显。判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索保真度目标和对抗目标作为优化目标的有效性与其作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 进行系统性分析，比较不同保真度指标在感知优化和图像质量评估中的表现，研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响。

Result: 发现保真度指标在优化和评估之间存在明显的不对称性；判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用，其中补丁级和卷积架构比传统或基于Transformer的替代方案提供更忠实的细节重建。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与IQA可转移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Motivation: 现有VQA模型容易受训练数据偏见影响，过度依赖表面模式，难以泛化到多样化的问题和图像。

Method: 提出IOG-VQA模型，结合对象交互自注意力机制（捕捉图像中对象间的复杂交互）和GAN-Based Debiasing框架（生成无偏见数据分布）。

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和VQA-CP v2数据集上的实验表明，该模型在处理偏见和不平衡数据分布方面表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 同时解决对象交互和数据集偏见对于推进VQA任务至关重要，IOG-VQA模型为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频序列中的结构化噪声和背景伪影会掩盖动态内容，传统RPCA方法的稀疏性假设无法捕捉真实视频数据的丰富变异性。

Method: 集成低秩时间建模与扩散后验采样的混合框架，通过核范数正则化和扩散模型先验来提升视频恢复质量。

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA方法，在对比度增强(gCNR)和信号保持(KS统计量)方面表现出更好的去雾性能。

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型和深度生成先验对于高保真视频恢复具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性，重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏。基于此提出FerretNet，一个仅110万参数的轻量级神经网络。

Result: FerretNet仅在4类ProGAN数据集上训练，在包含22个生成模型的开放世界基准测试中达到97.1%的平均准确率，比最先进方法高出10.6%。

Conclusion: FerretNet能够高效、稳健地检测合成图像，在跨模型泛化能力方面表现优异，为合成图像检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an

*Patrick Knab,Sascha Marton,Philipp J. Schubert,Drago Guggiana,Christian Bartelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoTIF是一个基于transformer架构的可解释视频分类框架，将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频数据，通过全局概念重要性、局部概念相关性和时间依赖性三个视角来解释视频中的动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念瓶颈模型主要针对静态图像，难以处理视频数据中的时间依赖性，而时间依赖对于捕捉动作和事件至关重要。

Method: 受transformer启发，MoTIF采用概念瓶颈框架处理任意长度的视频序列，将概念定义为跨时间重复出现的语义实体（如物体、属性、动作组件），形成描述动作的motif模式。

Result: 实验结果表明概念建模范式可以有效地迁移到视频数据，在保持竞争力的性能的同时，能够更好地理解时间上下文中的概念贡献。

Conclusion: MoTIF成功地将概念瓶颈模型扩展到视频分类领域，为视频理解提供了可解释的分析框架，代码已开源。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Method: 提出FSMODNet框架，利用可变形注意力机制有效结合可见光和热成像图像的独特优势，实现跨模态特征集成。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在低数据量情况下仍能实现有效的目标检测性能，优于多个基于最先进模型建立的基线方法。

Conclusion: FSMODNet通过跨模态特征集成展示了在复杂条件下对少样本多光谱目标检测的鲁棒适应性，为有限标注数据场景下的多模态目标检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot multispectral object detection (FSMOD) addresses the challenge of
detecting objects across visible and thermal modalities with minimal annotated
data. In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework
named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve
detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the
unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the
proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and
environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show
effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes,
outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本文提出使用粒子滤波器解决基于相机测量的3D物体定位问题，特别适用于远距离物体或计算资源受限的场景，如无人机野火监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在远距离物体监测或计算资源受限的任务中，传统的密集深度估计或3D场景重建方法不可行，需要一种更高效的定位解决方案。

Method: 使用粒子滤波器处理单目标和多目标场景，结合GNSS相机姿态估计和图像分割序列进行3D物体定位。

Result: 通过3D仿真和无人机图像分割序列验证，粒子滤波器能够有效解决相机姿态和图像分割基础上的实际定位任务。

Conclusion: 粒子滤波器方法独立于检测方法，具有灵活性，可用于无人机野火监测等实际应用。

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Han Li,Liang He,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SwinMamba框架，结合Swin Transformer的局部窗口扫描和Vision Mamba的全局感受野，用于遥感图像语义分割，在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割面临高空间分辨率、复杂场景结构和多尺度物体的挑战。Vision Mamba虽然具有全局感受野和低计算复杂度，但过度依赖全局扫描会忽略关键的局部特征（如纹理和边缘），影响分割精度。

Method: SwinMamba框架将局部Mamba风格扫描与全局感受野相结合：前两个阶段执行局部扫描捕获细粒度细节，后两个阶段利用全局扫描融合上下文信息；使用重叠移位窗口增强区域间信息交换。

Result: 在LoveDA和ISPRS Potsdam数据集上的大量实验表明，SwinMamba优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: SwinMamba通过有效整合局部和全局特征，为遥感图像语义分割提供了优越的解决方案，展示了其有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

*Wenhao Tang,Heng Fang,Ge Wu,Xiang Li,Ming-Ming Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于打包的多实例学习框架，用于解决计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极长、变化大和监督有限的问题，通过打包采样、残差分支和注意力下采样器来提高训练效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（可达20万）、显著的序列长度变化（从200到20万）和有限的监督，这些极端变化导致数据异构性和冗余性高，传统方法在有限监督下难以有效处理这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一个打包的多实例学习框架，将多个采样的变长特征序列打包成固定长度序列以实现批量训练；引入残差分支将多个切片丢弃的特征组合成超切片进行训练；使用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，该方法实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 通过解决计算病理学中的数据挑战，该方法在基础模型时代显示出巨大潜力，证明了关注数据挑战的重要性。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: SimDiff是一个模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接集成到去噪过程中，无需推理时的重复模拟器调用，即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散过程中加入基于模拟器的运动投影层来确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序性质导致计算成本高昂，无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过条件化环境参数（如重力、风力）直接集成到去噪过程中。

Result: SimDiff能够高效生成物理合理的运动，无需推理时的重复模拟器调用，并对不同物理系数提供细粒度控制，成功泛化到未见过的环境参数组合。

Conclusion: SimDiff展示了组合泛化能力，为物理合理的人体运动生成提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过分析1174个预训练视觉模型，识别出四个能显著提升模型对高斯噪声鲁棒性的设计模式：更大的stem卷积核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及监督式ViT而非CLIP ViT，并提供了理论解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉模型架构设计选择对鲁棒性的影响，将经验观察转化为可操作的设计规则，以提升模型对高斯噪声的抵抗能力。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别鲁棒性设计模式，并通过理论分析（包括低通滤波理论、池化操作分析和Lipschitz边界）解释这些发现。

Result: 识别出的设计模式可带来高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。理论分析证实了这些设计选择的有效性，如大stem核可二次衰减噪声，平均池化比最大池化更优，CLIP ViT的预处理方式会增加敏感性。

Conclusion: 研究将鲁棒性分解为可解释的模块，提供了理论解释，并建立了实用的即插即用设计指南，用于构建对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Method: 采用PRISMA-ScR指导的范围综述方法，系统性地映射手术场景图研究的应用领域、方法进展和未来方向。

Result: 研究发现手术场景图研究快速增长，但存在关键的'数据鸿沟'：内视图研究主要使用真实2D视频，而外视图4D建模严重依赖模拟数据。方法上从基础图神经网络发展到专门的基础模型，在手术场景中显著优于通用大视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: 手术场景图正在成熟为重要的语义桥梁技术，能够支持新一代智能系统提升手术安全性、效率和培训质量，尽管数据标注和实时实现等挑战仍需解决。

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and
training.

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

TL;DR: ASD是一种适配器，能够在无需任何预训练、聚类学习或已训练聚类模型的前提下，实现自监督学习（SSL）的冷启动，用于深度图像聚类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的将SSL技术集成到深度聚类框架中的方法都需要预训练、聚类学习或已训练模型作为前提条件，这限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活性和即插即用应用。

Method: 1. 从所有未标记数据中随机采样伪标记数据，并设置实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签；2. 利用实例级分类能力跟踪未标记数据预测的类别转换，提取实例级类别的高层相似性；3. 利用这些相似性为伪标记数据分配聚类级标签；4. 使用带有聚类级标签的伪标记数据触发在未标记数据上训练的通用SSL学习器进行图像聚类。

Result: ASD在各种基准测试中表现出优于最新深度图像聚类方法的性能，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有很小的精度差距（例如在CIFAR-10上仅差1.33%）。此外，ASD还能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入的深度图像聚类方法的性能。

Conclusion: ASD提供了一种无需任何前提条件的有效方法，能够实现SSL学习器的冷启动，为深度图像聚类任务提供了灵活且即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

TL;DR: 提出SiNGER蒸馏框架，通过零空间引导的能量重分配来抑制Vision Transformer中的高范数伪影，同时保留有用信号，提升学生模型的表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影在知识蒸馏过程中会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽视有用信号，限制了大型模型的性能提升。

Method: 使用零空间引导的扰动方法对教师特征进行精炼，通过LoRA适配器实现高效扰动，在抑制伪影的同时保留信息，然后将精炼后的特征蒸馏给学生模型。

Result: 在多个下游任务中实现了最先进的性能，生成了更清晰、更可解释的表示。

Conclusion: SiNGER框架有效解决了教师特征中伪影抑制与信号保留的权衡问题，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

Abstract: Cloud segmentation is a critical preprocessing step for many Earth

configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出KD-SS算法，用于植物器官点云分割，无需降采样即可处理全分辨率点云数据，适用于不同植物种类和传感器模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有植物点云分割方法通常针对特定植物种类或传感器，且需要大量预处理和降采样，限制了应用范围和精度。

Method: 开发KD-SS（K-Dimensional Sub-Sampling）算法，这是一种轻量级的子采样方法，能够保持原始点云分辨率，与现有分割模型结合使用。

Result: 在摄影测量、激光三角测量和LiDAR等多种传感器模态下，KD-SS结合现有分割模型取得了令人满意的分割结果。

Conclusion: KD-SS可作为传统密集预处理和降采样方法的轻量级替代方案，适用于不同植物种类和传感器模态的器官分割。

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

TL;DR: Mambo是一个新的前景-背景分解框架，用于解决少样本分布外检测中现有方法对局部类别相似性过度依赖和固定背景补丁提取策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前景-背景分解方法在少样本分布外检测中由于过度依赖局部类别相似性和固定的背景补丁提取策略，导致鲁棒性较低。

Method: 提出学习背景提示来获取包含背景和图像语义信息的局部背景相似性，然后使用局部类别相似性来细化局部背景相似性。同时提出补丁自校准调优，根据样本多样性灵活选择不同数量的背景补丁。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，Mambo在分布外检测和近分布外检测设置方面相比最先进方法取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: Mambo框架通过结合局部背景相似性和局部类别相似性进行背景提取，并采用灵活的补丁选择策略，有效提升了少样本分布外检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种用于图像分割任务的数据集划分方法：迭代像素分层（IPS）和Wasserstein驱动的进化分层（WDES），旨在解决随机划分导致的测试集不具代表性和模型评估偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割中随机划分数据集会导致测试集不具有代表性，造成评估偏差和模型泛化能力差。虽然分层采样在分类任务中有效，但由于分割数据的多标签结构和类别不平衡特性，将其扩展到分割任务具有挑战性。

Method: 1. 迭代像素分层（IPS）：基于现有分层概念的简单标签感知采样方法；2. Wasserstein驱动的进化分层（WDES）：新颖的遗传算法，通过最小化Wasserstein距离来优化数据集划分间的标签分布相似性。

Result: WDES方法在多个分割任务（街景、医学影像、卫星图像）中都能产生更具代表性的数据划分，降低性能方差并改善模型评估。特别是在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时效果显著。

Conclusion: WDES方法在图像分割数据集划分中优于随机采样，能够有效减少评估偏差，提高模型泛化能力，特别是在具有挑战性的数据集上表现突出。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net是一个端到端的深度神经网络模型，利用语义关联（以层次结构形式）作为监督信号，在细粒度分类任务中表现出色，无需裁剪技术或手动标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的细粒度分类模型大多依赖部件标注或自动提取注意力图，但这些方法存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时还会形成语义关联，因此本文利用层次化的语义关联作为监督信号。

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net模型，将语义关联以层次结构（分类学）形式作为监督信号，在端到端的深度神经网络中实现。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个知名数据集上的实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最新最先进方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 利用语义层次结构作为监督信号可以有效提升细粒度分类性能，无需依赖裁剪技术或手动标注，为细粒度识别提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了对抗性补丁在Vision Transformers(ViTs)上的可迁移性，发现CNN中使用的对抗攻击技术可以成功迁移到ViT模型，不同ViT模型对对抗补丁的脆弱性存在显著差异，预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的韧性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统依赖度的增加，其安全性成为关键问题。Vision Transformers(ViTs)在现代机器学习中获得广泛应用，因其相比卷积神经网络(CNNs)具有更好的性能和对抗扰动的鲁棒性。然而，ViTs仍然容易受到逃避攻击，特别是对抗性补丁的攻击。

Method: 研究通过设计现实的对抗性补丁，使用褶皱变换(CT)技术在人物与非人物分类任务中引起误分类。该方法添加了类似于穿着衣物时自然发生的细微几何扭曲。实验评估了四个微调ViT模型在二元人物分类任务上的表现。

Result: 实验结果显示不同ViT模型存在显著脆弱性差异：攻击成功率从40.04%(google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k)到99.97%(facebook/dino-vitb16)不等。这些结果证实了对抗性补丁从CNNs到ViTs的跨架构可迁移性。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集规模和方法论强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的韧性，对抗性补丁攻击技术可以在不同神经网络架构之间成功迁移，这对AI系统的安全性提出了重要警示。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer是一个新颖的视频概念迁移架构，通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念迁移，包括前景主体、背景和运动流的三重分解，以及基于Chain-of-Prompt的渐进式去噪过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法在精确控制和编辑性方面存在局限，需要一种能够对视频不同组件进行细粒度控制的架构，同时利用大规模无标签视频数据进行表示学习。

Method: 提出空间分解（前景、背景、运动流）和扩散时间步分解的双重架构；采用双流到单流的DiT架构；引入基于随机掩码的自监督预训练策略；提出Chain-of-Prompt机制将去噪过程分解为三个粒度阶段；构建OpenAnimal动物视频数据集。

Result: 在多样化参考图像和场景上实现了高质量可控的视频概念迁移，在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步的双重分解架构，结合自监督学习和Chain-of-Prompt机制，为视频概念迁移任务提供了有效的解决方案，在控制精度和生成质量上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

TL;DR: 本文提出视觉测试时缩放（VTTS）方法，通过推理过程中的迭代感知来增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力，模仿人类分层注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LLM推理来分析解析后的视觉信息，受限于静态感知阶段，需要更动态的感知推理机制。

Method: VTTS采用迭代感知机制，结合强化学习和时空监督来优化推理，通过逐步聚焦高置信度时空区域来提升性能。

Result: VTTS在超过15个基准测试中平均提升超过5%，显著优于Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型。

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了MLLMs的性能，在视频对话、视频推理和时空感知等任务上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

TL;DR: Mammo-CLIP Dissect是一个基于概念的解释性框架，用于系统分析乳腺X光摄影深度学习视觉模型学习的概念，通过乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型标记神经元并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解深度学习模型学习的内容对于临床环境中人工智能的安全部署至关重要。以往研究主要关注基于像素的解释方法，而较少关注模型学习的文本概念，这些概念可能更好地反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺摄影专用视觉语言模型（Mammo-CLIP）作为"解剖器"，在指定层用人类可解释的文本概念标记神经元，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。研究比较了在不同数据集上训练的模型以及微调对概念学习的影响。

Result: 在乳腺摄影数据上训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念，且与放射科医生工作流程更一致。针对特定任务的微调增强了某些概念类别（如良性钙化）的捕获，但可能减少其他类别（如密度相关特征）的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect提供了关于卷积神经网络如何捕获乳腺摄影特定知识的见解，揭示了领域特定训练和任务特定适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即中间推理过程与视频动态不符，即使最终答案正确也会影响可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于动态时间规整（DTW）的过程奖励机制，通过规则化奖励将推理轨迹与时间锚定的参考对齐，实现无需辅助奖励模型的高效过程监督。

Result: MOSS-ChatV在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%的准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上也有性能提升，并在Qwen2.5-VL和Phi-2等不同架构上均获得一致增益。

Conclusion: 该框架能够产生更一致和稳定的推理轨迹，具有广泛的适用性，为视频推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

TL;DR: CARINOX是一个结合噪声优化和探索的统一框架，通过基于人类判断相关性的奖励选择程序，显著提升文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂对象关系、属性和空间排列时往往无法实现组合对齐。现有的推理时方法各有局限性：优化可能因初始化差或搜索轨迹不佳而停滞，而探索可能需要大量样本来找到满意输出。

Method: CARINOX框架结合了噪声优化和探索策略，采用基于与人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序，克服单一奖励指标或临时组合的局限性。

Result: 在两个互补基准测试中，CARINOX在T2I-CompBench++上平均对齐分数提高16%，在HRS基准上提高11%，在所有主要类别中均优于最先进的优化和探索方法，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CARINOX通过统一的优化-探索框架和原则性奖励选择，有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐问题，为复杂提示生成高质量图像提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过整合相机和物体运动为像素运动，有效提升了视频生成的准确性和一致性，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测性有重要影响，中等复杂度数据集为判别器提供了最有利的检测条件。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统CLIP模型在处理不同分辨率图像时的计算效率问题，WAVECLIP旨在通过自适应分辨率推理，在保持准确性的同时显著减少计算开销。

Method: WAVECLIP使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，支持从低分辨率到高分辨率的渐进处理，并采用基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应早期退出，利用键值缓存和跨层注意力重用计算。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中，WAVECLIP通过轻量级蒸馏从冻结的CLIP教师模型学习，实现了竞争力的准确性，同时显著节省了计算资源。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP通过小波分词和自适应推理机制，成功实现了在单一部署模型中动态权衡计算与准确性，为高效视觉语言模型提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

TL;DR: 本文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅影响精度，还能改善模型校准和OOD检测性能，挑战了效率与性能必须权衡的传统观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响（特别是超出精度之外的可靠性指标）尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用大规模量化评估方法，不仅评估分布内精度，还包括全面的可靠性指标套件，并分析预训练来源对量化效果的影响。

Result: 量化能持续改善通常欠自信预训练模型的校准，同时发现即使校准退化，OOD检测性能仍可提升。特定QAT方法能同时提升零样本精度、校准和OOD鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 量化在高效、可靠、鲁棒的VLM部署中具有超越传统角色的重要作用，为多目标优化问题提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例，涵盖20个任务，基于200万个独特表格，其中88%保留了原始可视化效果。该数据集旨在解决现有基准缺乏真实世界表格复杂性和视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性。现有视觉表格理解数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含配对的图像-HTML表示、全面元数据和溯源信息。使用该数据集对Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调的模型在已见和未见视觉表格理解任务上表现更好，对真实世界表格可视化的鲁棒性增强。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化效果并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来视觉表格理解模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于共形预测的新方法，让用户能够直接控制生成解释的保真度，通过识别能够保持模型预测的关键特征子集，无需真实解释进行校准。


<details>

Motivation: 特征归因方法在图像预测解释中广泛使用，但现有方法的鲁棒性不一，且可能无法忠实反映黑盒模型的推理过程。

Method: 提出四种一致性函数来量化解释与模型预测的符合程度，使用共形预测框架识别关键特征子集，确保排除其他特征信息后仍能保持模型预测。

Result: 在6个图像数据集上使用5种解释器进行实证评估，FastSHAP在保真度和信息效率（解释区域大小）方面均优于竞争方法，基于超像素的一致性度量比像素级度量更有效。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可控的解释保真度框架，无需真实解释标签，在多个数据集上验证了其有效性，特别强调了超像素度量的优势。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

TL;DR: Sigma是一个基于骨架的手语理解统一框架，通过早期融合机制、分层对齐学习和统一预训练策略，解决了语义基础弱、局部与全局不平衡、跨模态学习效率低等关键问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个关键限制：1）语义基础弱，模型难以将骨架运动模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低。

Method: 提出Sigma框架，包含：1）手语感知早期融合机制，促进视觉与文本模态深度交互；2）分层对齐学习策略，在不同层级最大化跨模态特征一致性；3）结合对比学习、文本匹配和语言建模的统一预训练框架。

Result: 在孤立手语识别、连续手语识别和无注释手语翻译等多个基准测试中取得最先进结果，涵盖不同手语和口语语言。

Conclusion: Sigma证明了语义信息丰富的预训练的有效性，以及骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的可行性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 本文对文本-图像生成评估中广泛使用的指标进行了全面研究，分析了这些指标在捕捉提示中对象、属性和关系方面的表现，并与人类判断进行了对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本-图像生成技术发展迅速，但评估输出是否真正捕捉到提示中的对象、属性和关系仍是一个核心挑战。当前评估主要依赖自动化指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而非经过人类判断验证，因此需要了解这些指标与人类偏好的匹配程度。

Method: 通过广泛研究多种广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标，分析它们在不同组合挑战中的行为，并比较不同指标家族与人类判断的一致性。研究超越了简单的相关性分析。

Result: 结果显示没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致：性能随组合问题类型而变化。基于VQA的指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越，而某些基于嵌入的指标在特定情况下表现更强。仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小，因为它们设计用于感知质量而非对齐度。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在可信评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明地选择指标的重要性。指标选择应根据具体任务类型进行，不能依赖单一指标。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络(GNNs)进行全切片图像分析，通过熵基自适应融合策略平衡局部和全局信息，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕获局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限性。

Method: 集成Mamba架构(擅长长距离全局依赖)和GNNs(强调细粒度短距离空间交互)，引入基于熵的自适应融合策略动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，SlideMamba的PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，显著优于MIL、Trans-MIL、Mamba-only、GNN-only和GAT-Mamba等方法。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合自适应融合策略展现出强大性能，在计算病理学的空间解析预测建模任务中具有广阔应用前景。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

Motivation: 现有的3D生成模型主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每个示例选择一种控制模态，偏向更难的控制信号。

Conclusion: Hunyuan3D-Omni通过统一的多模态控制框架，显著提升了3D资产生成的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN模型经常利用表面相关性进行"作弊"预测，缺乏可靠的决策依据。现有方法依赖专家标注，可扩展性差。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型自动生成语义注意力图，通过辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导的注意力图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到最先进性能，减少了捷径依赖，注意力图更符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够在不依赖人工标注的情况下提高模型的可靠性和认知合理性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen

diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注提示与生成内容的对齐，但忽视了模型基于先验知识或偏见生成的超出提示的内容，需要明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象。

Method: 提出将T2I幻觉定义为偏见驱动的偏差，并建立包含属性幻觉、关系幻觉和对象幻觉的三类分类法。

Result: 该框架为T2I模型评估设定了上限，并揭示了隐藏的模型偏见，为更丰富的模型评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为文本到图像生成模型的幻觉问题提供了系统的定义和分类方法，有助于更全面地评估模型性能。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

Conclusion: 该框架通过分布鲁棒优化有效解决了微动作识别中的人物间差异问题，提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：几何歧义（依赖2D基础模型特征难以区分对称结构）和最近邻规则（像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持）。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 利用VGGT的几何基础特征和密集匹配能力，通过重用早期特征阶段、微调后期阶段、添加语义头实现双向对应；采用循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进式训练方法，在数据稀缺情况下适应语义匹配场景。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优越，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了语义匹配中的几何歧义和最近邻规则问题，通过有效利用3D几何基础模型并在数据稀缺情况下进行适应性调整，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedVSR是一个针对医学视频超分辨率的定制框架，通过跨状态空间传播解决帧对齐问题，使用内部状态空间重建模块增强组织结构并减少伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率医学视频对准确诊断至关重要，但硬件限制和生理约束使其难以获取。现有VSR模型在处理医学视频时面临相机抖动、噪声、帧间突变等独特挑战，导致光流误差和对齐困难，且容易引入可能误导医生的伪影和失真特征。

Method: 提出MedVSR框架：1）跨状态空间传播（CSSP）将远距离帧投影为状态空间模型中的控制矩阵，选择性传播一致且信息丰富的特征以实现有效对齐；2）内部状态空间重建（ISSR）模块通过联合长程空间特征学习和大核短程信息聚合来增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Result: 在包括内窥镜和白内障手术在内的四个医学场景数据集上的实验表明，MedVSR在重建性能和效率方面显著优于现有VSR模型。

Conclusion: MedVSR通过专门设计的对齐和重建机制，有效解决了医学视频超分辨率的独特挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的高分辨率视频支持。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

TL;DR: 本文提出了Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)方法来解决强化学习微调中的梯度消失问题，并发布了大规模高质量的长链思维数据资源，开源了多模态推理模型家族。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理模型面临两大限制：缺乏开放、大规模、高质量的长链思维数据，以及强化学习后训练的不稳定性。GRPO标准框架在奖励方差低时容易出现梯度消失问题。

Method: 提出Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS)数据选择策略，通过Variance Promotion Score (VPS)结合结果方差和轨迹多样性来提升奖励方差；发布包含160万条长链思维数据和1.5万条RL问答对的大规模资源；开源多尺度多模态推理模型。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中验证了精心策划的数据和VAS方法的有效性。理论分析表明奖励方差下界了期望策略梯度幅度，VAS是实现这一保证的实用机制。

Conclusion: 该工作通过数据策略优化和资源开放，有效解决了多模态推理模型训练中的关键问题，为社区建立了标准化基准。

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构的海洋科学基础模型，通过预训练在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行重建，并在下游任务中验证其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋科学中标记数据稀缺且收集成本高，而预训练的基础模型可以利用大量未标记数据，改变AI在海洋科学中的应用方式。

Method: 使用Prithvi-EO Vision Transformer架构，在Sentinel-3 OLCI数据上进行预训练以重建数据，然后通过微调应用于叶绿素浓度定量和海洋初级生产力估算两个下游任务。

Result: 模型在海洋监测中表现出实用性，特别是在利用少量高质量标记数据和捕捉海洋颜色详细空间模式方面表现优异，同时与点观测数据匹配良好。

Conclusion: 新一代地理空间AI模型有潜力为海洋生态系统及其在全球气候过程中的作用提供更稳健、数据驱动的见解。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) Foundation models (FMs), pre-trained on massive
unlabelled datasets, have the potential to drastically change AI applications
in ocean science, where labelled data are often sparse and expensive to
collect. In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO
Vision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data
from the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the
model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真的图像合成，通过利用预训练的扩散模型来解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的物体插入问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了必要的物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏合适的框架来释放这些能力。

Method: SHINE引入流形引导锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器（如IP-Adapter）来指导潜在表示，实现忠实的主体表示同时保持背景完整性。还提出了退化抑制引导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench基准测试中，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个有效的训练免费框架，能够处理复杂光照条件下的高质量图像合成任务，并引入了新的基准测试ComplexCompo来推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: QuantVGGT是一个针对十亿级视觉几何基础Transformer（VGGT）的量化框架，通过双平滑细粒度量化和噪声过滤多样化采样技术，解决了PTQ在压缩VGGT时面临的重尾分布和校准样本选择不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）计算和内存成本过高，阻碍了实际部署。虽然PTQ是常见的模型压缩方法，但在压缩十亿级VGGT时面临数据无关特殊令牌导致的重尾激活分布和多视图3D数据校准样本选择不稳定的独特障碍。

Method: 1. 双平滑细粒度量化：结合预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑来缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2. 噪声过滤多样化采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样化校准簇以确保稳定的量化范围。

Result: QuantVGGT在不同基准和位宽下实现了最先进的结果，显著优于之前的通用量化方法。4位QuantVGGT可实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持重建精度达到全精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有巨大优势和实用性，为VGGT的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in

Motivation: 让计算密集型的整流流模型能够在资源受限的消费设备上运行，实现生成式AI的真正普及。

Method: 采用重新设计的分布匹配目标进行少步蒸馏，引入时间步共享减少梯度噪声，分时间步微调提升提示对齐，并结合文本编码器重构和专用量化等管道优化。

Result: 通过大规模用户研究评估，SD3.5-Flash在少步方法中表现优异，支持从手机到台式机的各种硬件配置。

Conclusion: 该框架使先进的生成式AI真正实现了实用部署，为各种设备提供了快速生成和内存高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个结合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)建模牛顿运动，为视频生成过程注入潜在动力学约束，实现物理一致且参数可控的视频合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型仅从外观学习运动分布，缺乏对底层动力学的理解，导致产生不现实的运动（如物体向上坠落）和速度方向的突变。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导来实现物理一致的视频合成。

Result: 该框架能够生成物理一致性的视频，并支持精确的参数控制，解决了现有模型在物理动力学建模方面的局限性。

Conclusion: NewtonGen通过集成数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理，为文本到视频生成提供了物理一致性和可控性的有效解决方案。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于语言模型的外交事件叙事修改框架，通过调整文本特征来将公众情绪从负面转向中性或正面，成功率70%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统调查方法耗时耗力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力，需要更高效的数据驱动方法

Method: 1)训练语言模型预测公众对事件的反应；2)基于传播理论和专家意见确定可修改的文本特征；3)开发反事实生成算法系统修改原始文本

Result: 框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达到70%

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的叙事框架建议

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言间语音变异性和说话人表达风格差异的挑战，需要能够对齐不同说话人和语言间情感外部化表达的方法。

Method: 使用基于图聚类的说话人社区构建方法捕捉共享说话人特征，在说话人空间和音素空间应用双重空间锚定技术实现跨语言情感迁移。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，该方法相比竞争基线具有更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解，证明了所提框架在跨语言语音情感识别任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种机器学习方法在区分ChatGPT-3.5生成的文本与人类撰写文本方面的性能，发现DistilBERT表现最佳，而集成学习方法未能超越单一最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，AI生成文本与人类文本的界限日益模糊，这引发了学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等紧迫问题，需要可靠的AI文本检测方法来维护数字通信的信任。

Method: 使用包含250对研究摘要的标注数据集，测试和比较了经典机器学习方法（逻辑回归配合词袋模型、词性标注和TF-IDF特征）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT配合N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT配合轻量级分类器、以及基于LSTM的N-gram模型）。

Result: DistilBERT取得了整体最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom提供了稳定平衡的替代方案，而LSTM和BERT-N-gram方法表现较差。三个最佳模型的最大投票集成未能超越DistilBERT本身。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示方法优于模型多样性，本研究为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来跟上不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at

### [93] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG提出了一种基于模型自知识的学习和过滤方法，通过强化学习框架来识别和过滤检索到的无关内容，从而提高RAG性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索系统可能返回不相关内容，将这些信息整合到模型中会导致幻觉问题。需要理解模型"知道"和"不知道"的内容（自知识）来更好地整合内部知识和外部检索知识。

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，利用模型的自知识来确定哪些检索文档对回答查询有益。设计了基于强化学习的训练框架，在句子级别粒度上过滤无关内容，同时保留有用知识。

Result: 在Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B模型上使用多个问答基准进行评估，实验结果表明SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量。

Conclusion: 验证了自知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，SKILL-RAG方法有效提升了RAG系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [94] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，用于基于LLM的文本转语音系统，通过词级情感控制实现动态情感转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感文本转语音系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化，需要更细粒度的情感建模方法。

Method: 使用Emo-FiLM框架，将emotion2vec的帧级特征与单词对齐获得词级情感标注，通过FiLM层直接调制文本嵌入实现词级情感控制。

Result: 实验表明Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM成功解决了情感文本转语音中的动态情感转换问题，为更自然的人机交互提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出USB-Rec框架，通过LLM偏好优化数据集构建和自增强策略，在训练和推理阶段提升LLM在对话推荐系统中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLM的总结和分析能力，而忽视了训练问题，因此需要从模型层面提升LLM在对话推荐中的性能。

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于强化学习训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘训练获得的对话推荐潜力。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过整合训练和推理阶段，有效提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的性能表现。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Conformal Importance Summarization框架，使用保形预测为摘要生成提供严格的内容覆盖保证，确保在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域的关键内容不被遗漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的自动摘要系统在高风险领域缺乏对关键内容包含的可靠保证，需要一种能够提供严格覆盖保证的方法。

Method: 通过在校准集上校准句子级重要性分数的阈值，实现具有用户指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要，该方法与模型无关且可与现有黑盒LLMs无缝集成。

Result: 在已建立的摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization实现了理论上保证的信息覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠、可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TikTok等短视频平台由于其多模态、动态和嘈杂的内容特性，给虚假信息检测带来了独特挑战，需要专门工具来辅助人工核查。

Method: 采用模块化、仅推理的流水线，集成语音转录、OCR、物体和深度伪造检测、视频到文本摘要以及声明验证等技术。

Result: 在两个多语言TikTok视频手动标注数据集上的验证显示，该系统取得了有希望的结果，加权F1分数超过70%。

Conclusion: ShortCheck为短视频平台的事实核查提供了一个有效的自动化解决方案，能够显著提高核查效率。

Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok present unique challenges for
misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object

ShortCheck is validated by evaluating it on two manually annotated datasets
with TikTok videos in a multilingual setting. The pipeline achieves promising
results with F1-weighted score over 70\%.

*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MARS是一个基于角色的多智能体协作框架，通过模拟审稿流程来提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论相同准确率的同时，将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大的问题，需要频繁的智能体间通信，导致token消耗和推理时间显著增加。

Method: MARS采用审稿流程设计：作者智能体生成初始解决方案，审稿人智能体独立提供决策和评论，元审稿人整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订，避免了审稿人之间的交互成本。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间均减少了约50%。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过角色化协作设计，在保证推理质量的同时有效控制了计算成本，为大语言模型的高效推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SiniticMTError数据集，该数据集为英语到普通话、粤语和吴语的机器翻译提供了错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重程度的标注，旨在支持低资源语言的机器翻译研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年来取得了重大进展，但对于许多缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源的低资源语言（如粤语和吴语），进展仍然有限。这些语言虽然各有超过8000万使用者，但相关研究资源匮乏。

Method: 基于现有的平行语料库，通过母语者的严格标注流程，提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重程度的注释，并分析标注者间一致性、迭代反馈以及错误类型和严重程度的模式。

Result: 构建了SiniticMTError数据集，该数据集可作为资源供机器翻译社区使用，用于微调具有错误检测能力的模型，支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估的研究。

Conclusion: SiniticMTError数据集为低资源语言的机器翻译研究提供了重要资源，有助于提升这些语言的翻译质量评估和模型改进。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM是一个统一的多语言医疗诊断框架，能够在英语、印地语和孟加拉语之间进行零样本跨语言诊断，无需语言特定微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗环境中，由于低资源语言中标注医疗数据的稀缺性以及跨人群的语言变异性，从临床文本中自动诊断疾病仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 基于多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器，结合语言感知注意力机制和疾病分类头，使用Siamese对比学习模块实现跨语言语义对齐，并通过翻译一致性模块和对比投影头强化语言不变表示学习。采用多任务学习策略联合优化疾病分类、翻译对齐和对比学习目标，并使用MAML实现快速适应能力。

Result: 在监督设置下达到97.22%的测试准确率和97.17%的F1分数；在零样本场景下，印地语达到92.78%准确率，孟加拉语达到73.33%准确率。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在低资源环境下表现出强大的泛化能力，为多语言医疗诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DS-MoE是一种动态推理链架构，通过深度专业化的专家混合模型，为不同复杂度的输入动态组装定制化的推理链，实现计算效率、推理质量和可解释性的同步提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer对所有输入应用相同的处理深度，导致简单查询浪费计算资源，复杂问题推理深度不足。需要一种能够根据输入复杂度自适应调整处理深度的架构。

Method: 提出深度专业化专家混合模型（DS-MoE），包含针对不同推理深度的专家模块（浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理、记忆整合、元认知监督），通过学习路由网络动态组装推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上实验显示，DS-MoE相比均匀深度Transformer节省16%计算量，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理任务准确率提高2.8%，同时提供可解释的推理链。

Conclusion: DS-MoE代表了自适应神经架构的重要进展，证明深度专业化模块化处理可以同时提升大规模语言模型的效率、推理质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HRT是一种受小波启发的分层Transformer架构，通过多分辨率处理语言，解决了标准Transformer将文本视为扁平序列的问题，实现了O(nlogn)复杂度，在多个基准测试中显著优于标准Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer架构将语言处理为扁平标记序列，忽视了语言的分层本质，导致二次计算成本、弱组合泛化能力和不足的语篇级建模。

Method: 提出分层分辨率Transformer（HRT），构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的上下文化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减实现高效处理。

Result: HRT在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103等基准测试中平均提升3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言分层组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发处理在理论效率和实践语言理解方面的双重优势。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配模型，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练模型，在8步采样下达到与1024步离散流基线相当的困惑度，实现128倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，扩散语言模型需要数百到数千次模型评估，FS-DFM旨在实现快速高质量的语言生成。

Method: 采用离散流匹配技术，训练模型在不同步数预算下保持一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹蒸馏的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM用8步采样达到与1024步离散流基线相当的困惑度，采样速度提升128倍。

Conclusion: FS-DFM实现了少步采样的稳定性、准确性和易控性，为快速高质量语言生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Motivation: 大语言模型的进展受限于评估瓶颈：需要构建基准、评估模型和设置，然后迭代。因此研究能否在运行实验前预测结果。

Method: 研究文本性能预测：从任务描述和配置估计模型得分，无需访问数据集实例。构建PRECOG语料库，包含多样任务、领域和指标的红描描述-性能对。

Result: 任务具有挑战性但可行：配备检索模块的模型在高置信度阈值下达到8.7的平均绝对误差。分析显示强推理模型进行多样迭代查询，而开源模型表现滞后。

Conclusion: PRECOG语料库和分析为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音素转录训练数据很少，需要解决数据稀疏问题来构建准确的音素识别器。

Method: 1）多任务训练方案，引入辅助损失函数估计正交文本标签和输入信号的音高模式；2）融合两个估计器（基于音素字母串和文本标记序列），使用有限状态转换器框架开发组合算法。

Result: 提出的方法将CSJ核心评估集的平均音节标签错误率从12.3%降低到7.1%，相比通用多语言识别器具有优势。

Conclusion: 多任务学习和融合方法对于构建准确的音素识别器是有效的，两种方法在相对优势上进行了比较验证。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Motivation: 虽然GNN和自监督学习在MPP方面取得了进展，但人类先验知识的整合仍然不可或缺。LLMs存在知识空白和幻觉问题，特别是对于研究较少的分子性质。

Method: 通过提示LLMs生成领域相关知识和可执行代码进行分子向量化，产生基于知识的特征，然后与结构表示融合。使用了GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLMs进行知识提取。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实了LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为MPP提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与分子结构特征的集成是提升分子性质预测性能的有效途径，特别是在处理研究较少的分子性质时具有优势。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

*Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为RedHerring的新型攻击方法，旨在使文本攻击检测模型不可靠，同时保持分类器的正确性，从而在分类器和检测器之间制造矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本攻击检测模型虽然能成功识别被攻击者修改的文本，但其可靠性尚未得到充分验证。作者希望通过研究检测模型的脆弱性，揭示攻击者可能针对检测模型的新威胁方式。

Method: RedHerring攻击通过修改文本，使检测模型误判为攻击，同时确保分类器仍能正确分类。在4个数据集上对3种检测器和4种分类器进行了测试，并提出了简单的置信度检查作为防御方法。

Result: RedHerring攻击能够将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时保持（甚至提高）分类器准确率。提出的置信度检查防御方法无需重新训练模型即可大幅提高检测准确率。

Conclusion: 这种新型威胁模型为理解攻击者如何针对检测模型提供了新的见解，揭示了检测模型在实际应用中的潜在脆弱性。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

*Abhinay Shankar Belde,Rohit Ramkumar,Jonathan Rusert*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优点，显著降低对抗性文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于transformer的架构复杂性增加，对抗性文本攻击的计算成本急剧上升，现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，对资源有限的研究者来说效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于哪些长度的文本来结合广义Binary和GreedySelect。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均可将每次攻击所需的查询次数减少高达25.82%，且不损失攻击效果。

Conclusion: 提出的新策略有效解决了对抗性文本攻击中的高计算成本问题，为资源有限的研究者提供了实用的攻击测试方案。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

*Hsiao-Ying Huang,Yi-Cheng Lin,Hung-yi Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MI-Fuse是一个去噪标签融合框架，用于解决语音情感识别中的领域不匹配问题。该方法利用API访问的大音频语言模型和源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，通过互信息加权融合预测，在目标域无标签数据上实现学生模型对LALM的超越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中的语音情感识别系统经常因领域不匹配而失效，且源数据不可用，只能通过API访问强大的LALM。研究目标是仅使用无标签目标域音频和API访问的LALM，能否让学生模型在目标域超越LALM的性能。

Method: 提出MI-Fuse去噪标签融合框架：将LALM和源域训练的SER分类器作为双教师，从两者获取多个随机预测，基于互信息的不确定性加权平均分布，并使用指数移动平均教师稳定训练过程。

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域迁移任务上的实验显示，该方法取得一致增益，学生模型超越LALM，比最强基线高出3.9%。

Conclusion: MI-Fuse方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实的适应能力，为领域不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督神经语法归纳模型面临表达能力瓶颈，导致生成过大但性能不佳的语法。核心问题是概率分布崩溃。

Method: 分析了概率分布崩溃在神经参数化关键组件中的出现机制，并提出了崩溃松弛神经参数化方法来解决这个问题。

Result: 该方法在多种语言上显著提高了解析性能，同时能够使用更紧凑的语法。

Conclusion: 崩溃松弛神经参数化方法有效解决了无监督语法归纳中的表达能力瓶颈问题，为更高效的语法学习提供了新途径。

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

TL;DR: C2R是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过构建和优化子问题及其答案来提升问答任务的置信度评分，适用于文本、图像和视频领域的多种模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的问答模型在复杂推理任务中置信度评估不够可靠，需要一种能够提升答案可靠性的通用方法。

Method: C2R首先构建子问题及其答案的集合，探索不同的推理路径，然后比较答案候选的置信度分数来选择最可靠的最终答案。

Result: C2R能够与多种现有问答模型无缝集成，在不同模型和基准测试中均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于子问题数量和质量对模型推理可靠性影响的重要见解，证明了C2R框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了监督微调(SFT)对LLM通用能力的负面影响，发现使用较小的学习率可以显著减轻性能下降，并提出新的Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting(TALR)方法，在保持目标领域性能的同时更好地平衡通用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为SFT会损害LLM的通用能力，但作者发现这种权衡并非不可避免，希望通过理论和实证研究找到更好的平衡策略。

Method: 提出了Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting(TALR)方法，并与L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等基线方法进行比较，同时探索了学习率对性能平衡的影响。

Result: 实验表明，虽然没有任何方法能完全消除权衡，但TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面始终优于基线方法，较小的学习率也能实现有利的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出了实用的LLM适配指南：使用小学习率实现有利权衡，当需要更强平衡时采用TALR策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了原子理论，将大语言模型内部表示的基本单元定义为原子，解决了神经元多义性和特征重建不稳定的问题。通过原子内积校正表示偏移，证明了原子满足受限等距性质，并验证了单层稀疏自编码器可以可靠识别原子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内部表示的基本单元尚未明确定义，限制了对其机制的理解。神经元存在多义性问题，而特征面临重建不可靠和不稳定的问题，需要找到更合适的表示单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子作为基本表示单元；引入原子内积校正表示偏移；证明原子满足受限等距性质；训练阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上验证理论。

Result: 在多个模型层上平均达到99.9%的稀疏重建精度；超过99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件，而神经元和特征分别只有0.5%和68.2%；缩放实验揭示了稀疏自编码器大小与恢复能力的关系。

Conclusion: 原子理论为大语言模型内部表示提供了系统的理论框架，更准确地捕捉了模型的本质表示，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

*Genki Kusano*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出对话式提示方法，通过将用户评论转化为多轮对话格式，在少样本和无训练约束下实现个性化评论生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和无训练的情况，现有方法假设用户有大量历史评论或需要额外模型训练，而LLMs的有效性依赖提示工程。

Method: 提出对话式提示方法：简单对话提示(SCP)仅使用用户自身评论，对比对话提示(CCP)插入其他用户或LLMs的错误回复并要求模型纠正，以鼓励生成符合用户风格的文本。

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLMs上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成的评论与随机用户相似，而SCP和CCP生成的评论更接近目标用户，即使每个用户只有2条评论。

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和无训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

TL;DR: Enrich-on-Graph (EoG) 是一个利用LLM先验知识来丰富知识图谱的框架，旨在弥合结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟，提升知识图谱问答的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在复杂任务中表现出强大的推理能力，但在知识密集型场景（如知识图谱问答）中仍存在幻觉和事实错误。这主要是由于结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟，现有方法通常忽略这一差距。

Method: 提出EoG框架，利用LLM的先验知识对知识图谱进行丰富，以弥合图谱与查询之间的语义差距。该框架支持高效证据提取，确保低计算成本、可扩展性和跨方法适应性，并提出了三个图质量评估指标来分析查询-图谱对齐。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，EoG能够有效生成高质量的知识图谱，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架通过丰富知识图谱有效解决了语义鸿沟问题，提升了KGQA任务的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持了计算效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: PoCO是一种新颖的语法错误校正方法，通过先利用大语言模型进行过度校正以提高召回率，然后使用小模型进行后校正来保持精度，从而平衡召回率和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在语法错误校正中精度高但召回率低，而大语言模型则倾向于过度校正导致精度低。PoCO旨在结合两者的优势，解决召回率不足的问题。

Method: PoCO首先使用大语言模型进行过度校正以最大化召回率，然后通过微调的小模型进行后校正，识别和修正错误输出。

Result: 实验表明，PoCO在语法错误校正中有效平衡了召回率和精度，提高了整体性能。

Conclusion: PoCO通过结合大语言模型和小模型的优势，成功提升了语法错误校正的质量和平衡性。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型多示例上下文学习计算成本高的问题，因为需要处理更长的输入token

Method: 通过将多示例ICL的信息提炼为简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文

Result: 在具有挑战性的推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少的token实现了与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，且无需测试时检索即可匹配基于检索的ICL

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLMs进行下游任务的一个实用替代方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用，用户输入可能无意中暴露敏感信息。现有的文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性和实用性。

Method: 采用零样本、基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过结构化搜索指导逐步重写隐私敏感片段，动态探索重写空间。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线方法，在隐私保护和实用性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私保护文本处理提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保护敏感信息的同时保持文本的质量和可用性。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WeFT是一种针对扩散语言模型的加权监督微调方法，通过基于熵的权重分配来解决扩散模型在SFT中缺乏精确概率估计的问题，在推理任务上显著优于标准SFT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中展现出潜力，但应用于监督微调时面临挑战，因为它们在每个去噪步骤缺乏精确概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测和不一致。需要控制关键标记来引导生成方向。

Method: 提出WeFT方法，这是一种加权SFT方法，根据标记的熵为不同标记分配不同权重。该方法基于扩散理论设计。

Result: 在s1K、s1K-1.1和3k样本上进行训练，在四个推理基准测试（Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500）上相比标准SFT分别实现了39%、64%和83%的相对改进。

Conclusion: WeFT方法有效解决了扩散语言模型在SFT中的挑战，显著提升了推理任务的性能，代码和模型将公开提供。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and

TL;DR: 本文系统研究如何让医学推理模型生成答案排序列表而非单一答案，提出了提示和微调两种方法，并发现强化微调在多格式答案生成中更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型仅训练生成单一答案，这限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 采用提示和微调两种方法：提示法成本低但泛化性差；微调包括监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT），RFT通过奖励函数激励模型探索最大化奖励的答案。

Result: SFT模型在某些答案格式上表现良好，但RFT模型在多种格式上更具鲁棒性。模型虽可能无法选择基准的首选答案，但能识别有效答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排序列表答案的方法，为开发超越单一答案的替代格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SummQ是一个新颖的对抗性多智能体框架，通过总结和测验两个互补领域的专门智能体协作来解决长文档摘要中的信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在长文档摘要任务中存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性问题，需要新的方法来提升摘要质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含总结生成器、总结评审器、测验生成器、测验评审器和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的长文档摘要方法，利用对抗性智能体协作来改善摘要质量，证明了多智能体协作动态的有效性。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

*Zirui He,Haiyan Zhao,Ali Payani,Mengnan du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了MemLens方法，通过分析数字令牌在生成过程中的概率轨迹来检测LLM的记忆化现象，发现受污染样本在模型早期层就锁定答案，而干净样本则在整个模型深度中逐渐积累证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于词汇重叠和困惑度的记忆检测方法泛化能力差，在遇到隐式污染数据时性能显著下降，需要更有效的检测手段。

Method: MemLens通过分析数字令牌生成的概率轨迹，识别受污染样本的"捷径"行为模式，并通过LoRA微调注入设计样本进行验证。

Result: 受污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹，MemLens能够有效捕捉真实的记忆信号而非虚假相关性。

Conclusion: MemLens提供了一种基于激活轨迹分析的有效记忆检测方法，为LLM评估中的污染问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

*Krishna Aggarwal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨句子理解中的记忆负荷是否更好地由句法相关词之间的线性接近度或中间材料的结构密度来解释，提出了干预者复杂度作为改进线性距离测量的结构基础指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于局部性理论和跨语言依赖长度最小化证据，研究旨在调和线性和层次视角对局部性的理解，通过识别中间头部作为整合和维护需求的更直接指标。

Method: 使用统一依赖树库和混合效应框架分析多个语言，同时评估句子长度、依赖长度和干预者复杂度作为记忆负荷预测因子的作用。

Result: 所有三个因素都与记忆负荷正相关，句子长度影响最广泛，干预者复杂度在线性距离之外提供额外解释力。

Conclusion: 研究在概念上调和了线性和层次视角，方法上展示了基于UD的图测量和跨语言混合效应建模如何区分线性和结构对处理效率的贡献。

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了阿拉伯语大语言模型的工具调用能力，探讨了阿拉伯语训练数据、指令微调和特定工具微调对性能的影响，并创建了阿拉伯语工具调用数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对阿拉伯语等其他语言的研究，需要填补这一空白以开发阿拉伯语的工具增强智能体。

Method: 使用开源阿拉伯语LLM进行实验，翻译并适配两个开源工具调用数据集为阿拉伯语，研究三种策略：阿拉伯语数据vs跨语言迁移、通用指令微调效果、特定工具微调价值。

Result: 通过大量实验获得了开发阿拉伯语工具增强智能体的关键见解和最优策略。

Conclusion: 研究为开发鲁棒的阿拉伯语工具调用能力提供了重要指导，填补了非英语语言工具调用研究的空白。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用大语言模型（LLMs）自动评估学术文本输入问题的方法，提出了五种评估系统并在计算机科学教育数据集上测试，发现参考辅助评估方法效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在教育领域，LLMs已被研究作为学生和教师的辅助工具，但如何利用LLMs自动评估学术文本输入问题（使用评分标准）仍需深入探索。

Method: 提出了五种评估系统：JudgeLM评估、参考辅助评估、无参考评估、加法评估和自适应评估，使用JudgeLM、Llama-3.1-8B和DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B三个模型在110个计算机科学学生答案数据集上进行测试。

Result: 参考辅助评估方法表现最佳，与人工评估相比具有最低的中位数绝对偏差（0.945）和均方根偏差（1.214），能提供公平评分和全面评估。其他方法在简洁答案评估上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 基于人工智能的自动评估系统，配合适当的方法论，有潜力作为其他学术资源的补充工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦资助研发中心面临大量文本工作负载，手动分析速度缓慢，需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 使用大型语言模型，仅需少量输入输出示例即可完成文本分析任务，并应用OnPrem.LLM开源框架确保数据安全和主权。

Result: 在国防政策文件和科学文献（如NDAA和NSF奖项）的案例研究中，该方法有效提升了监督和战略分析能力。

Abstract: Federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) face text-heavy
workloads, from policy documents to scientific and engineering papers, that are
slow to analyze manually. We show how large language models can accelerate
summarization, classification, extraction, and sense-making with only a few
input-output examples. To enable use in sensitive government contexts, we apply
OnPrem$.$LLM, an open-source framework for secure and flexible application of
generative AI. Case studies on defense policy documents and scientific corpora,
including the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and National Science
Foundation (NSF) Awards, demonstrate how this approach enhances oversight and
strategic analysis while maintaining auditability and data sovereignty.

### [128] [Behind RoPE: How Does Causal Mask Encode Positional Information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21042)
*Junu Kim,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Lei Ji,Yeyun Gong,Edward Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文证明了因果掩码可以在没有参数或因果依赖的情况下在注意力分数中诱导位置依赖模式，这些模式倾向于偏好附近的查询-键对，与常见位置编码的行为相似。研究发现因果掩码与RoPE的相互作用会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力分数模式为非相对模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然显式位置编码（如RoPE）是Transformer解码器中位置信息的主要来源，但因果掩码也提供位置信息。本文旨在研究因果掩码作为位置信息源的重要性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明因果掩码可以诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并进行实证分析验证训练模型中的这种行为。

Result: 理论分析表明因果掩码诱导的注意力模式倾向于偏好附近的查询-键对。实证分析证实训练模型表现出相同行为，学习参数进一步放大这些模式。因果掩码与RoPE的相互作用会扭曲RoPE的相对注意力分数模式。

Conclusion: 在现代大型语言模型中一致观察到这种效应，表明除了显式位置编码外，将因果掩码视为位置信息源的重要性。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型同时遵循多个指令的能力，并为此创建了两个专门基准测试。研究发现随着指令数量的增加，模型性能会下降，并提出了一种基于逻辑回归的预测模型来估计未见指令组合的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在现实场景中的应用日益增多，理解它们同时遵循多个指令的能力变得至关重要。由于评估所有可能的指令组合在计算上不可行，需要开发有效的性能估计方法。

Method: 引入了两个专门基准测试：ManyIFEval（最多10个指令的文本生成）和StyleMBPP（最多6个指令的代码生成）。开发了三种回归模型，特别是使用指令数量作为解释变量的逻辑回归模型，来预测未见指令组合的性能。

Result: 实验表明，随着指令数量的增加，所有10个测试的LLM性能都会下降。逻辑回归模型能够以约10%的误差预测多指令遵循性能，且相对较小的样本量（ManyIFEval 500个，StyleMBPP 300个）就足够进行性能估计。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估LLMs的多指令遵循能力提供了有效工具，证明了回归模型可以高效预测未见指令组合的性能，为实际应用中的模型评估提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SoM-1K，首个针对材料强度问题的多模态基准数据集，评估了基础模型在复杂工程问题上的表现，发现当前模型表现不佳（最佳准确率仅56.6%），并提出DoI提示策略改善视觉理解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在多个领域表现出色，但在复杂多模态工程问题上的性能尚未充分探索。材料强度问题涉及文本和图表，是评估模型多模态推理能力的理想测试平台。

Method: 构建包含1,065个标注问题的SoM-1K数据集，提出DoI（图像描述）提示策略，用专家生成的文本描述替代原始图像输入，评估8个代表性基础模型（LLMs和VLMs）。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率仅56.6%。有趣的是，配备DoI的LLMs通常优于直接处理图像的VLMs。错误分析显示DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 本研究为工程AI建立了严格基准，揭示了当前基础模型在多模态推理能力上的不足，特别是在科学工程领域，需要开发更强大的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

TL;DR: 该论文识别并系统研究了LLMs中的文化定位偏见，即模型默认生成立场与主流文化对齐而将其他文化视为局外人。作者提出了CultureLens基准和两种推理时缓解方法，实证结果显示基于代理的方法能有效减轻偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现LLMs在生成应用中存在微妙的文化公平性问题，模型倾向于从主流美国文化视角生成内容，对其他文化表现出明显的局外人态度。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。提出两种缓解方法：基于提示的FIP方法和基于代理的MFA框架（包括单代理和多代理两种管道）。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的评估显示：模型在美国情境脚本中88%以上采用内部人语调，但对非主流文化主要采用局外人立场。基于代理的缓解方法显示出有效性。

Conclusion: 文化定位偏见是LLMs中一个重要的公平性问题，基于代理的缓解方法为解决生成式LLMs中的偏见提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程和人工验证来检测外在和内在幻觉，评估了12个LLM在波斯语文本幻觉检测方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是影响所有大型语言模型的持续问题，特别是在波斯语等低资源语言中更为严重，需要专门的评估基准来检测和缓解这一问题。

Method: 采用三阶段LLM驱动流程，结合人工验证生成QA和摘要任务的合理答案，利用生成token的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并让人工标注者突出波斯语特定语境。

Result: 评估的12个LLM在检测波斯语幻觉文本方面普遍表现不佳，提供外部知识（如原始文档）可以部分缓解幻觉问题，专门为波斯语训练的LLM与其他模型在幻觉方面没有显著差异。

Conclusion: 波斯语LLM在幻觉检测方面存在挑战，需要进一步改进模型在处理低资源语言时的幻觉问题，外部知识可以作为缓解策略之一。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的搜索增强LLMs虽然减轻了用户的认知负担，但无法充分满足不同用户的多样化需求，缺乏对个性化能力的系统性评估。

Method: 通过长期深入的人类标注构建基准，让人类标注者贡献自己的历史记录、编写详细信息需求的查询，并用评分和诊断反馈评估响应。

Result: BESPOKE基准揭示了信息检索任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLMs的细粒度评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE提供了一个现实且诊断性的基准，能够系统评估搜索增强LLMs的个性化能力，推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [134] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个口语化的偏见基准测试数据集，扩展自BBQ，用于评估口语语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，口语语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容层面和声学层面，需要专门的评估工具来同时诊断这两种偏见。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的所有上下文转换为受控的语音条件，生成可比较的准确度、偏见和一致性评分，用于评估口语语言模型。

Result: 评估LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型发现：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，而Qwen2-Audio显著减弱这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的测试平台，可用于联合诊断口语语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

### [135] [Acoustic-based Gender Differentiation in Speech-aware Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21125)
*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个用于分析语音语言模型中基于声学的性别差异的新数据集，发现语音模型在性别刻板印象问题上表现出男性导向的偏见，而在需要性别区分的语境中却表现出性别无关的回应，这种矛盾模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器生成的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音感知语言模型可能表现出基于声学的性别差异，即相同的问题会根据说话者的性别得到不同的回应，但目前缺乏系统分析这种现象的数据集和方法。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类问题，评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，并通过与对应骨干LLM的比较分析偏见来源。

Result: 发现矛盾模式：在性别刻板印象问题上所有模型一致表现出男性导向回应；在需要性别区分的语境中却表现出性别无关回应；这种模式主要源于Whisper语音编码器。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，优先考虑一般公平原则而非语境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来在语音技术中正确利用性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

### [137] [Retrieval over Classification: Integrating Relation Semantics for Multimodal Relation Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21151)
*Lei Hei,Tingjing Liao,Yingxin Pei,Yiyang Qi,Jiaqi Wang,Ruiting Li,Feiliang Ren*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了ROC框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，解决了传统分类方法在结构约束和语义表达方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的关系抽取方法主要采用基于分类的范式，存在两个显著局限：一是忽视了实体类型和位置线索等结构约束，二是缺乏对细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架通过多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，使用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，并通过基于语义相似度的对比学习来对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，并展现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过检索范式有效解决了多模态关系抽取中的结构约束和语义表达问题，为关系理解提供了更强大的方法。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

### [138] [Learning the Wrong Lessons: Syntactic-Domain Spurious Correlations in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21155)
*Chantal Shaib,Vinith M. Suriyakumar,Levent Sagun,Byron C. Wallace,Marzyeh Ghassemi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现LLM在训练过程中会学习语法模板与领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性有时会覆盖提示语义，导致模型性能下降，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要理解任务指令的语义和领域才能正确响应，但语法也能传递隐含信息。研究发现语法模板在训练数据中普遍存在，并可能影响模型输出，因此需要系统性地研究语法、领域和语义之间的关系。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析语法-领域相关性对OLMo-2模型性能的影响；开发评估框架检测已训练模型中的这种现象；通过案例研究分析对安全微调的影响。

Result: 语法-领域相关性会降低OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（平均0.51±0.06）；在FlanV2数据集上，这种现象出现在开源（OLMo-2-7B、Llama-4-Maverick）和闭源（GPT-4o）模型中；意外语法-领域相关性可被用于绕过OLMo-2-7B Instruct和GPT-4o的拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要：(1)明确测试语法-领域相关性；(2)确保训练数据中的语法多样性，特别是在领域内，以防止此类虚假相关性。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

*Tyler Loakman,William Thorne,Chenghua Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文综述了计算幽默领域，重点关注幽默生成和解释任务，指出当前模型在非双关语幽默处理上仍落后于人类能力，并讨论了该领域的未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且依赖上下文的概念，需要大量推理能力，因此适合评估现代大语言模型的常识知识和推理能力。

Method: 采用文献综述的方法，调查计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别关注幽默生成和解释任务。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但超越双关语的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型在幽默处理能力上仍远不及人类水平。

Conclusion: 强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并基于幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性，提出了该领域未来研究的广泛讨论方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

### [140] [GEP: A GCG-Based method for extracting personally identifiable information from chatbots built on small language models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21192)
*Jieli Zhu,Vi Ngoc-Nha Tran*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了基于小语言模型（SLM）的聊天机器人的个人可识别信息（PII）泄露问题，提出了专门针对PII提取的贪心坐标梯度方法（GEP），在SLM条件下显著提高了PII泄露检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然小语言模型在某些领域表现出与大型语言模型相当的性能且能耗更低，但其在下游任务中的个人可识别信息泄露问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调了ChatBioGPT聊天机器人，然后提出了GEP方法（基于贪心坐标梯度的PII提取方法），该方法在模板攻击无效的情况下有效提取PII信息。

Result: GEP方法相比之前的模板方法泄露量增加了60倍，在自由风格插入的复杂场景下仍能达到4.53%的PII泄露率。

Conclusion: 研究表明SLM存在严重的PII泄露风险，GEP方法能有效检测这种泄露，为SLM的安全性评估提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一框架，结合隐式检索和结构化协作来解决大语言模型在科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索带来的工具税和多智能体管道的平均化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型科学推理中的两个关键问题：显式检索会中断推理过程并增加额外开销，多智能体管道会稀释强解决方案。

Method: 采用基于Monitor的隐式检索模块在token级别集成外部知识，结合分层解决方案精炼（HSR）和质量感知迭代推理（QAIR）进行结构化协作。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率，比最强基线提升13.4点，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的智能体步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼能够克服显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效问题，推理失败和知识差距在85%以上的案例中同时出现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

*Xinzhe Xu,Liang Zhao,Hongshen Xu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLaw是一个专门评估LLM在中国法律知识应用方面能力的新基准，包含64,849条法律条文和254个案例推理实例，发现当前LLM在法律条文准确引用方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在法律文本分析中可靠性不足，因为其预训练缺乏法律领域的专门化，需要专门基准来评估其法律知识和推理能力。

Method: 构建CLaw基准，包含两个部分：(1) 306部中国国家法律的细粒度语料库，按子段落分割并包含历史修订时间点；(2) 254个基于中国最高法院材料的案例推理实例。

Result: 实证评估显示大多数当代LLM在准确复述法律条文方面表现不佳，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确知识检索（可通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大通用推理能力的协同作用，本研究为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SGMem是一种句子图记忆方法，用于解决长对话中超出LLM上下文窗口的问题，通过构建句子级图结构来组织不同粒度的对话信息，在长对话问答任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于事实提取或摘要的方法虽然减少了冗余，但难以组织和检索跨不同粒度（轮次、回合、会话）的对话信息和生成记忆，需要更有效的长期对话记忆管理方案。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉跨轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索的原始对话与生成的记忆（摘要、事实、见解），为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高了准确性，在长期对话问答任务中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效管理长期对话记忆，为LLM提供更好的上下文支持，在长对话场景中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

TL;DR: QCG-RAG是一个查询中心图RAG框架，通过查询粒度索引和多跳块检索解决现有图RAG方法的粒度困境，在问答准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图带来高token成本且丢失上下文，粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 利用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建查询中心图，实现可控粒度，提高图质量和可解释性；采用定制化多跳检索机制通过生成查询选择相关块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确性上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了新范式，通过查询中心方法有效解决了图RAG的粒度问题。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了同形异义词在扩散模型中导致的重复生成问题，分析了Anglocentric偏差的影响，并提出了一种测量重复率的方法和通过提示扩展缓解该问题的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同形异义词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）对生成模型构成挑战，扩散模型在处理同形异义词时可能同时生成多个词义，导致同形异义重复问题。Anglocentric偏差进一步加剧了这一问题，使得非英语中的非同形词在翻译成英语后也可能变成同形异义词。

Method: 引入了一种测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型进行自动评估和人工评估来评估不同扩散模型。同时研究了通过提示扩展来缓解同形异义重复问题的方法。

Result: 研究表明提示扩展方法能有效减少同形异义重复问题，包括由Anglocentric偏差引起的重复。自动评估管道代码已公开可用。

Conclusion: 同形异义重复是扩散模型面临的重要问题，Anglocentric偏差加剧了这一问题。通过提示扩展可以有效缓解该问题，为改进文本到图像生成模型提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出任务依赖的输出同质化评估和缓解方法，通过任务分类、功能多样性定义和任务锚定采样技术，在保持质量的同时增加多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作未能以任务依赖的方式概念化多样性，不同任务对输出同质化的定义和问题严重性不同。

Method: 提出包含八个任务类别的分类法，定义任务锚定功能多样性，开发任务锚定采样技术，挑战多样性-质量权衡观念。

Result: 成功增加功能多样性同时保持响应质量，证明任务依赖方法能有效评估和缓解输出同质化问题。

Conclusion: 任务依赖方法显著改进了输出同质化的评估和缓解，为语言模型输出多样性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

Motivation: 现有数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要是英语、缺乏混合人机创作的场景，且没有提供字符级注释来精确定位AI生成片段

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语语料库，提供字符级注释，支持全文分类和AI生成区间检测两个关键任务

Result: 构建了LLMTrace数据集，包含英语和俄语文本，具有字符级注释，能够精确定位文本中的AI生成片段

Conclusion: LLMTrace将作为训练和评估下一代更细致实用的AI检测模型的重要资源

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level

### [148] [Bounds of Chain-of-Thought Robustness: Reasoning Steps, Embed Norms, and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21284)
*Dingzirui Wang,Xuanliang Zhang,Keyan Xu,Qingfu Zhu,Wanxiang Che,Yang Deng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从理论上分析了输入扰动对Chain-of-Thought（CoT）输出波动的影响，推导了输出波动可接受范围内的输入扰动上界，并证明该上界与CoT推理步骤数正相关，且无限长推理过程也无法消除输入扰动的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明CoT输出受输入扰动影响显著，但缺乏理论解释，限制了深入理解扰动传播机制和提示优化方法的改进。

Method: 首先理论推导输入扰动上界，分析其与推理步骤数的关系；然后在线性自注意力模型上验证理论结论，证明扰动上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量范数负相关。

Result: 在三个主流数据集和四个主流模型上的实验结果与理论分析一致，验证了理论发现的正确性。

Conclusion: 输入扰动对CoT输出的影响具有理论可解释性，推理步骤数增加会提高扰动容忍度但无法完全消除影响，这为改进提示优化方法提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一种结合了冻结CLIP视觉编码器和新型张量网络文本编码器的多模态模型，通过显式编码句法结构来改进视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在大规模图像文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略了语言的结构性，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解降低参数数量，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: DisCoCLIP显著提升了对动词语义和词序的敏感性：将CLIP的SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系得分分别提高超过9%和4%，在新引入的SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构可以产生可解释、参数高效的表示，显著改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发在低资源环境下有效运作且保持文化根基的多语言AI系统是一个长期挑战，合成数据在多元文化环境中的有效性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容进行自下而上的数据生成，创建了包含13种印度语言的Updesh指令跟随数据集

Result: 通过自动指标和人工评估验证了生成数据的高质量，微调模型在生成任务上取得显著提升，在低中资源语言中改进最为明显

Conclusion: 有效的多语言AI需要结合情境感知、文化根基方法的多方面数据策展和生成策略

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将大语言模型中的谄媚行为分解为谄媚性同意和谄媚性赞美，并与真诚同意进行对比，发现这三种行为在潜在空间中沿着不同的线性方向编码，可以独立调控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出谄媚行为，但尚不清楚这些行为是来自单一机制还是多个不同的过程。

Method: 使用均值差异方向、激活添加和子空间几何方法，在多个模型和数据集上分析谄媚性同意、谄媚性赞美和真诚同意的表示结构。

Result: 发现三种行为在潜在空间中沿着不同的线性方向编码，可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为，且这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为对应着不同的、可独立调控的表示，这表明谄媚行为具有独立的神经表征机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

TL;DR: RLBFF结合了RLHF的灵活性和RLVR的精确性，通过将自然语言反馈转化为可二元验证的原则来训练奖励模型，在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF缺乏可解释性且容易奖励攻击，RLVR局限于基于正确性的验证。需要一种能结合人类偏好灵活性和规则验证精确性的方法。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二元回答的原则（如信息准确性、代码可读性），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务（响应是否满足任意原则）。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上达到81.4%（截至2025年9月24日排名第一），使用RLBFF对齐的Qwen3-32B在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1的性能。

Conclusion: RLBFF提供了一种可解释且灵活的奖励建模方法，允许用户在推理时指定关注原则，并以低于5%的推理成本实现最先进的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

### [154] [An Approach to Checking Correctness for Agentic Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20364)
*Thomas J Sheffler*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于监控AI代理行为的时间表达式语言，通过监测代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹来检测与预期行为模式的偏差，解决了传统基于文本匹配的错误检测方法的脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理系统由于随机生成过程会产生可变输出，传统错误检测方法主要依赖输入输出的文本匹配，但由于LLM响应的自然语言变异性，这种方法很脆弱。需要一种能够独立于具体文本输出验证系统行为的方法。

Method: 借鉴硬件验证中的时序逻辑技术，开发了一种时间表达式语言来监控代理工具调用和状态转换的执行轨迹。该方法关注代理动作序列（如工具调用和代理间通信），允许验证系统行为而不依赖特定文本输出。时间表达式提供断言来捕获跨多个执行场景的正确行为模式。

Result: 在三代理系统的实验中，当使用大型模型时，所有时间断言在多次测试运行中都得到满足。但当在两个代理中使用较小模型时，执行违反了行为断言，主要由于工具序列不当和协调交接失败。时间表达式成功标记了这些异常。

Conclusion: 该方法为系统监控AI代理可靠性提供了基础，特别适用于关键应用中部署的代理系统。时间表达式具有双重用途：在开发期间验证提示工程和护栏有效性，在代理更新时提供回归测试。

Abstract: This paper presents a temporal expression language for monitoring AI agent
behavior, enabling systematic error-detection of LLM-based agentic systems that
exhibit variable outputs due to stochastic generation processes. Drawing from
temporal logic techniques used in hardware verification, this approach monitors
execution traces of agent tool calls and state transitions to detect deviations
from expected behavioral patterns. Current error-detection approaches rely
primarily on text matching of inputs and outputs, which proves fragile due to
the natural language variability inherent in LLM responses. The proposed method
instead focuses on the sequence of agent actions -- such as tool invocations
and inter-agent communications -- allowing verification of system behavior
independent of specific textual outputs. The temporal expression language
provides assertions that capture correct behavioral patterns across multiple
execution scenarios. These assertions serve dual purposes: validating prompt
engineering and guardrail effectiveness during development, and providing
regression testing when agents are updated with new LLMs or modified logic. The
approach is demonstrated using a three-agent system, where agents coordinate to
solve multi-step reasoning tasks. When powered by large, capable models, all
temporal assertions were satisfied across many test runs. However, when smaller
models were substituted in two of the three agents, executions violated
behavioral assertions, primarily due to improper tool sequencing and failed
coordination handoffs. The temporal expressions successfully flagged these
anomalies, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for detecting behavioral
regressions in production agentic systems. This approach provides a foundation
for systematic monitoring of AI agent reliability as these systems become
increasingly deployed in critical applications.

*Theo Uscidda,Matthew Trager,Michael Kleinman,Aditya Chattopadhyay,Wei Xia,Stefano Soatto*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种称为局部自适应测试时间缩放（LATTS）的方法，通过根据每个生成步骤的局部难度动态分配计算资源，优化LLM在测试时的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的验证器方法在测试时均匀增加计算量，不考虑不同样本和生成步骤的复杂性，导致资源使用效率低下。

Method: LATTS在每个生成步骤使用验证器模型的接受标准来决定是否重新采样、回溯、重启或停止生成过程，基于局部难度调整每步计算量。

Result: 实验结果表明，LATTS相比标准验证器方法实现了显著更优的准确率-计算权衡。

Conclusion: LATTS通过自适应计算分配有效解决了测试时缩放中的资源效率问题，为LLM性能优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: One common strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs) on downstream tasks involves using a \emph{verifier model} to either
select the best answer from a pool of candidates or to steer the
auto-regressive generation process towards better outputs. This class of
methods typically results in improved accuracy at the cost of increased
computation at test-time, a paradigm known as \emph{test-time scaling}.
However, most existing approaches increase computation uniformly across all
samples and generation steps, without considering the complexity of individual
instances, leading to inefficient resource use. We address this limitation by
proposing an approach, called \emph{Locally Adaptive Test-Time Scaling
(LATTS)}, that allocates variable compute across generation steps.
Specifically, at each generation step, LATTS employs a verifier-based
acceptance criterion to decide whether to resample, backtrack, restart, or stop
the generation process. This criterion effectively adjusts the per-step
computational effort based on a precise notion of \emph{local difficulty}
derived from the verifier model. Empirical results show that LATTS achieves
significantly superior accuracy--compute tradeoffs compared to standard
verifier-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的重构框架，用于动态验证和组装时间触发系统（TTS）的调度表，解决消息碰撞、优先级处理错误和无效调度等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态操作环境中，自适应调度对确保时间触发系统的可靠性和安全性至关重要。现有调度框架面临消息碰撞、优先级处理导致的死循环以及生成不完整或无效调度等问题，这些问题会损害系统安全性和性能。

Method: 提出的重构模型通过系统地将AI生成或启发式得到的调度优先级转换为完全可执行的调度表，确保遵守关键系统约束（如优先级规则和无碰撞通信）。框架包含鲁棒的安全检查、高效分配算法和恢复机制，以处理硬件故障和模式转换等意外上下文事件。

Conclusion: 这项工作为安全关键TTS中的安全调度生成问题提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，即使在高度动态和不确定的操作条件下也能实现可靠和灵活的实时调度。

Abstract: Adaptive scheduling is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of
time-triggered systems (TTS) in dynamic operational environments. Scheduling
frameworks face significant challenges, including message collisions, locked
loops from incorrect precedence handling, and the generation of incomplete or
invalid schedules, which can compromise system safety and performance. To
address these challenges, this paper presents a novel reconstruction framework
designed to dynamically validate and assemble schedules. The proposed
reconstruction models operate by systematically transforming AI-generated or
heuristically derived scheduling priorities into fully executable schedules,
ensuring adherence to critical system constraints such as precedence rules and
collision-free communication. It incorporates robust safety checks, efficient
allocation algorithms, and recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected context
events, including hardware failures and mode transitions. Comprehensive
experiments were conducted across multiple performance profiles, including
makespan minimisation, workload balancing, and energy efficiency, to validate
the operational effectiveness of the reconstruction models. Results demonstrate
that the proposed framework significantly enhances system adaptability,
operational integrity, and runtime performance while maintaining computational
efficiency. Overall, this work contributes a practical and scalable solution to
the problem of safe schedule generation in safety-critical TTS, enabling
reliable and flexible real-time scheduling even under highly dynamic and
uncertain operational conditions.

Abstract: Metascheduling in time-triggered architectures has been crucial in adapting
to dynamic and unpredictable environments, ensuring the reliability and
efficiency of task execution. However, traditional approaches face significant
challenges when training Artificial Intelligence (AI) scheduling inferences
offline, particularly due to the complexities involved in constructing a
comprehensive Multi-Schedule Graph (MSG) that accounts for all possible
scenarios. The process of generating an MSG that captures the vast probability
space, especially when considering context events like hardware failures, slack
variations, or mode changes, is resource-intensive and often infeasible. To
address these challenges, we propose an adaptive online learning unit
integrated within the metascheduler to enhance performance in real-time. The
primary motivation for developing this unit stems from the limitations of
offline training, where the MSG created is inherently a subset of the complete
space, focusing only on the most probable and critical context events. In the
online mode, Reinforcement Learning (RL) plays a pivotal role by continuously
exploring and discovering new scheduling solutions, thus expanding the MSG and
enhancing system performance over time. This dynamic adaptation allows the
system to handle unexpected events and complex scheduling scenarios more
effectively. Several RL models were implemented within the online learning
unit, each designed to address specific challenges in scheduling. These models
not only facilitate the discovery of new solutions but also optimize existing
schedulers, particularly when stricter deadlines or new performance criteria
are introduced. By continuously refining the AI inferences through real-time
training, the system remains flexible and capable of meeting evolving demands,
thus ensuring robustness and efficiency in large-scale, safety-critical
environments.

Conclusion: 提出的模糊识别系统能够有效检测污染信号并提高假肢控制的分类质量，为生物信号污染问题提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern anthropomorphic upper limb bioprostheses are typically controlled by
electromyographic (EMG) biosignals using a pattern recognition scheme.
Unfortunately, there are many factors originating from the human source of
objects to be classified and from the human-prosthesis interface that make it
difficult to obtain an acceptable classification quality. One of these factors
is the high susceptibility of biosignals to contamination, which can
considerably reduce the quality of classification of a recognition system.
  In the paper, the authors propose a new recognition system intended for EMG
based control of the hand prosthesis with detection of contaminated biosignals
in order to mitigate the adverse effect of contaminations. The system consists
of two ensembles: the set of one-class classifiers (OCC) to assess the degree
of contamination of individual channels and the ensemble of K-nearest
neighbours (KNN) classifier to recognise the patient's intent. For all
recognition systems, an original, coherent fuzzy model was developed, which
allows the use of a uniform soft (fuzzy) decision scheme throughout the
recognition process. The experimental evaluation was conducted using real
biosignals from a public repository. The goal was to provide an experimental
comparative analysis of the parameters and procedures of the developed method
on which the quality of the recognition system depends. The proposed fuzzy
recognition system was also compared with similar systems described in the
literature.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in LLM agents, they still face the challenge
of generating meaningful reflections due to inadequate error analysis and a
reliance on rare successful trajectories, especially in complex tasks. In this
work, we propose SAMULE, a new framework for self-learning agents powered by a
retrospective language model that is trained based on Multi-Level Reflection
Synthesis. It first synthesizes high-quality reflections across three
complementary levels: Single-Trajectory Learning (micro-level) for detailed
error correction; Intra-Task Learning (meso-level) to build error taxonomies
across multiple trials of the same task, and Inter-Task Learning (macro-level)
to extract transferable insights based on same typed errors from diverse task
failures. Then we fine-tune a language model serving as the retrospective model
to generate reflections during inference. We further extend our framework to
interactive settings through a foresight-based reflection mechanism, enabling
agents to proactively reflect and adapt during user interactions by comparing
predicted and actual responses. Extensive experiments on three challenging
benchmarks - TravelPlanner, NATURAL PLAN, and Tau-bench - demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms reflection-based baselines. Our results
highlight the critical role of well-designed reflection synthesis and
failure-centric learning in building self-improving LLM agents.

Abstract: Traditional static cybersecurity models often struggle with scalability,
real-time detection, and contextual responsiveness in the current digital
product ecosystems which include cloud services, application programming
interfaces (APIs), mobile platforms, and edge devices. This study introduces
autonomous goal driven agents capable of dynamic learning and context-aware
decision making as part of an adaptive cybersecurity architecture driven by
agentic artificial intelligence (AI). To facilitate autonomous threat
mitigation, proactive policy enforcement, and real-time anomaly detection, this
framework integrates agentic AI across the key ecosystem layers. Behavioral
baselining, decentralized risk scoring, and federated threat intelligence
sharing are important features. The capacity of the system to identify zero-day
attacks and dynamically modify access policies was demonstrated through native
cloud simulations. The evaluation results show increased adaptability,
decreased response latency, and improved detection accuracy. The architecture
provides an intelligent and scalable blueprint for safeguarding complex digital
infrastructure and is compatible with zero-trust models, thereby supporting the
adherence to international cybersecurity regulations.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product
description and a consumer profile; and (3) ranking generated and/or manually
created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

Conclusion: 结合结构化群体评分与模块化工具增强推理的方法可行，系统提供可追溯输出，减少幻觉，展现跨协议鲁棒性

Abstract: Purpose: To develop a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system powered by
LLaMA-4 109B for automated, protocol-aware, and interpretable evaluation of
radiotherapy treatment plans.
  Methods and Materials: We curated a multi-protocol dataset of 614
radiotherapy plans across four disease sites and constructed a knowledge base
containing normalized dose metrics and protocol-defined constraints. The RAG
system integrates three core modules: a retrieval engine optimized across five
SentenceTransformer backbones, a percentile prediction component based on
cohort similarity, and a clinical constraint checker. These tools are directed
by a large language model (LLM) using a multi-step prompt-driven reasoning
pipeline to produce concise, grounded evaluations.
  Results: Retrieval hyperparameters were optimized using Gaussian Process on a
scalarized loss function combining root mean squared error (RMSE), mean
absolute error (MAE), and clinically motivated accuracy thresholds. The best
configuration, based on all-MiniLM-L6-v2, achieved perfect nearest-neighbor
accuracy within a 5-percentile-point margin and a sub-2pt MAE. When tested
end-to-end, the RAG system achieved 100% agreement with the computed values by
standalone retrieval and constraint-checking modules on both percentile
estimates and constraint identification, confirming reliable execution of all
retrieval, prediction and checking steps.
  Conclusion: Our findings highlight the feasibility of combining structured
population-based scoring with modular tool-augmented reasoning for transparent,
scalable plan evaluation in radiation therapy. The system offers traceable
outputs, minimizes hallucination, and demonstrates robustness across protocols.
Future directions include clinician-led validation, and improved domain-adapted
retrieval models to enhance real-world integration.

TL;DR: Fairy是一个交互式多智能体移动助手，通过跨应用协作、交互式执行和持续学习来解决现有方法在真实移动GUI场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型在移动GUI代理中面临挑战：端到端方法在长尾应用上表现不佳，缺乏用户交互的代理会损害用户体验。需要能够持续积累应用知识并自我演化的解决方案。

Method: Fairy包含三个核心模块：(1)全局任务规划器从跨应用视角分解用户任务；(2)应用级执行器基于长短期记忆将子任务细化为步骤和动作，通过四个核心智能体在双循环中实现精确执行和用户交互；(3)自学习器将执行经验整合到应用地图和技巧中。

Conclusion: Fairy通过交互和自我学习机制，在真实移动场景中显著提升了任务执行效率和用户体验，证明了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Large multi-modal models (LMMs) have advanced mobile GUI agents. However,
existing methods struggle with real-world scenarios involving diverse app
interfaces and evolving user needs. End-to-end methods relying on model's
commonsense often fail on long-tail apps, and agents without user interaction
act unilaterally, harming user experience. To address these limitations, we
propose Fairy, an interactive multi-agent mobile assistant capable of
continuously accumulating app knowledge and self-evolving during usage. Fairy
enables cross-app collaboration, interactive execution, and continual learning
through three core modules:(i) a Global Task Planner that decomposes user tasks
into sub-tasks from a cross-app view; (ii) an App-Level Executor that refines
sub-tasks into steps and actions based on long- and short-term memory,
achieving precise execution and user interaction via four core agents operating
in dual loops; and (iii) a Self-Learner that consolidates execution experience
into App Map and Tricks. To evaluate Fairy, we introduce RealMobile-Eval, a
real-world benchmark with a comprehensive metric suite, and LMM-based agents
for automated scoring. Experiments show that Fairy with GPT-4o backbone
outperforms the previous SoTA by improving user requirement completion by 33.7%
and reducing redundant steps by 58.5%, showing the effectiveness of its

TL;DR: 提出一种结合自回归（AR）和非自回归（NAR）语言模型的新框架，利用NAR模型高效生成中间推理轨迹，再由AR模型生成精确最终答案，在保持质量的同时大幅提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AR模型生成连贯但推理速度慢，NAR模型并行生成速度快但质量较低。需要结合两者优势，在推理密集型任务（如数学和代码）中实现高效高质量的推理。

Method: 使用NAR模型（如离散扩散模型）并行生成中间推理轨迹，然后由AR模型基于这些轨迹生成最终答案，形成AR-NAR协同推理框架。

Result: 实验显示该方法相比强基线有26%的性能提升，同时显著降低了推理成本。

Conclusion: AR-NAR协同框架有效结合了两种模型的优势，在推理任务中实现了质量与效率的平衡，为复杂推理问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We study reasoning tasks through a framework that integrates auto-regressive
(AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) language models. AR models, which generate
text sequentially, excel at producing coherent outputs but often suffer from
slow inference, particularly in reasoning-intensive domains such as mathematics
and code, where lengthy chains of thought are required. In contrast, NAR
models, such as discrete diffusion models, allow parallel generation and offer
substantial speedups, though typically at the cost of reduced output quality.
To address these limitations, we introduce a new paradigm in which an NAR model
efficiently produces intermediate reasoning traces, which subsequently guide an
AR model to deliver precise final answers. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach yields significant 26% improvements over strong baselines while
substantially reducing inference cost.

Motivation: 当前机器人记忆研究缺乏高效的记忆检索和整合机制，无法有效应对复杂环境中的空间位置查询需求。

Method: 使用大语言模型构建高密度环境记忆表示，通过语义和空间模态的联合推理实现记忆检索和整合。

Result: 在SpaceLocQA和NaVQA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人平台上成功部署验证。

Conclusion: Meta-Memory为机器人提供了强大的空间推理能力，在复杂环境中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Navigating complex environments requires robots to effectively store
observations as memories and leverage them to answer human queries about
spatial locations, which is a critical yet underexplored research challenge.
While prior work has made progress in constructing robotic memory, few have
addressed the principled mechanisms needed for efficient memory retrieval and
integration. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Memory, a large language model
(LLM)-driven agent that constructs a high-density memory representation of the
environment. The key innovation of Meta-Memory lies in its capacity to retrieve
and integrate relevant memories through joint reasoning over semantic and
spatial modalities in response to natural language location queries, thereby
empowering robots with robust and accurate spatial reasoning capabilities. To
evaluate its performance, we introduce SpaceLocQA, a large-scale dataset
encompassing diverse real-world spatial question-answering scenarios.
Experimental results show that Meta-Memory significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on both the SpaceLocQA and the public NaVQA
benchmarks. Furthermore, we successfully deployed Meta-Memory on real-world
robotic platforms, demonstrating its practical utility in complex environments.

TL;DR: LogReasoner是一个粗到细的推理增强框架，通过专家思维建模和步骤细化来提升LLM在日志分析任务中的推理能力


<details>

Motivation: 通用LLM难以构建符合专家认知的结构化推理流程，在日志分析任务中缺乏精确的推理细节

Method: 两阶段框架：1)粗粒度专家思维增强，从故障排除流程图构建高层思维；2)细粒度步骤增强，通过任务特定解决方案微调LLM，并使用偏好学习校准推理细节

Result: 在四个不同日志分析任务上评估，使用Qwen-2.5和Llama-3等开源LLM，LogReasoner显著优于现有方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LogReasoner有效增强了LLM在日志分析中的推理能力，证明了该框架的实用性和有效性

Abstract: Log analysis is crucial for monitoring system health and diagnosing failures
in complex systems. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for automated log analysis, leveraging their reasoning
capabilities to perform tasks such as anomaly detection and failure prediction.
However, general-purpose LLMs struggle to formulate structured reasoning
workflows that align with expert cognition and deliver precise details of
reasoning steps. To address these challenges, we propose LogReasoner, a
coarse-to-fine reasoning enhancement framework designed to enable LLMs to
reason log analysis tasks like experts. LogReasoner consists of two stages: (1)
coarse-grained enhancement of expert thinking, where high-level expert thoughts
are constructed from collected troubleshooting flowcharts and existing tasks to
enable LLMs to formulate structured reasoning workflows and (2) fine-grained
enhancement of specific steps, where we first fine-tune the LLM with
task-specific stepwise solutions to enhance the LLM for instantiated reasoning,
then employ the preference learning to calibrate the LLM's reasoning details
from its mistakes, further strengthen the LLM's analytical granularity and
correctness. We evaluate LogReasoner on four distinct log analysis tasks using
open-source LLMs such as Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3. Experimental results show that
LogReasoner significantly outperforms existing LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs for log analysis.

Motivation: 现有多模态语言模型在视觉语言推理中可能依赖无关或虚假区域得出正确答案，表明模型并未真正理解图像内容，因此需要提高推理的忠实度。

Method: 提出DeFacto框架，包含三种训练范式：正向、反事实和随机掩码。通过自动定位问题相关证据构建数据集，使用GRPO强化学习训练模型，并设计三种互补奖励函数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DeFacto显著提高了答案准确性和推理忠实度，为可解释的多模态推理奠定了更强基础。

Conclusion: DeFacto通过反事实推理框架有效解决了多模态推理中的忠实度问题，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal language models (MLLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress in vision-language reasoning, especially with the emergence
of "thinking with images," which integrates explicit visual steps into the
reasoning process. While this paradigm strengthens image-based reasoning, a
significant challenge remains: models may arrive at correct answers by relying
on irrelevant or spurious regions, driven by prior knowledge or dataset biases.
Even when the answer is correct, flawed reasoning indicates that the model has
not truly understood the image, highlighting the critical importance of
reasoning fidelity in multimodal tasks. To address this issue, we propose
DeFacto, a counterfactual reasoning framework that jointly enforces accurate
answering and faithful reasoning. A key component of our approach is the design
of three complementary training paradigms: (i) positive, (ii) counterfactual,
and (iii) random-masking. To enable these paradigms, we develop a pipeline that
automatically localizes question-relevant evidence and constructs positive,
counterfactual, and random variants, resulting in a dataset of about 100k
images. Building on this framework, we train multimodal language models with
GRPO-based reinforcement learning, where we design three complementary rewards
to guide the model toward accurate answering and evidence-grounded reasoning.
Experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DeFacto substantially
improves both answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, establishing a
stronger foundation for interpretable multimodal reasoning. The code is
available on GitHub and the dataset is released on HuggingFace.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在精准医学中只能部分利用多组学数据、拓扑结构和文本知识，缺乏可靠的中间评估和机制可解释性，需要整合这些信息进行可解释的推理。

Method: GALAX框架将预训练图神经网络集成到大型语言模型中，通过图过程奖励模型进行强化学习，逐步生成疾病相关子图，实现过程级监督。

Result: 开发了Target-QA基准测试，结合CRISPR识别靶点、多组学数据和生物医学图知识，支持长上下文推理和可扩展的生物基础框架。

Conclusion: GALAX提供了一个可扩展、生物基础的可解释框架，通过强化引导的子图推理实现精准医学中可靠且可解释的靶点和通路发现。

Abstract: In precision medicine, quantitative multi-omic features, topological context,
and textual biological knowledge play vital roles in identifying
disease-critical signaling pathways and targets. Existing pipelines capture
only part of these-numerical omics ignore topological context, text-centric
LLMs lack quantitative grounded reasoning, and graph-only models underuse node
semantics and the generalization of LLMs-limiting mechanistic interpretability.
Although Process Reward Models (PRMs) aim to guide reasoning in LLMs, they
remain limited by unreliable intermediate evaluation, and vulnerability to
reward hacking with computational cost. These gaps motivate integrating
quantitative multi-omic signals, topological structure with node annotations,
and literature-scale text via LLMs, using subgraph reasoning as the principle
bridge linking numeric evidence, topological knowledge and language context.
Therefore, we propose GALAX (Graph Augmented LAnguage model with
eXplainability), an innovative framework that integrates pretrained Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) into Large Language Models (LLMs) via reinforcement
guided by a Graph Process Reward Model (GPRM), which generates disease-relevant
subgraphs in a step-wise manner initiated by an LLM and iteratively evaluated
by a pretrained GNN, enabling process-level supervision without explicit
intermediate reasoning annotations. As an application, we also introduced
Target-QA, a benchmark combining CRISPR-identified targets, multi-omic
profiles, and biomedical graph knowledge across diverse cancer cell lines,
which enables GNN pretraining for supervising step-wise graph construction and
supports long-context reasoning over text-numeric graphs (TNGs), providing a
scalable and biologically grounded framework for explainable,
reinforcement-guided subgraph reasoning toward reliable and interpretable
target and pathway discovery in precision medicine.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的星级评分系统虽然直观流行，但无法捕捉详细评论文本中的细微反馈。传统NLP技术在理解上下文细微差别、领域特定术语和讽刺等微妙语言特征方面存在困难。

Method: 采用模块化框架，利用大语言模型（LLMs）增强结构化提示技术，量化数值评分与文本情感之间的差异，提取详细的特征级洞察，并通过检索增强的对话问答（RAG-QA）支持交互式评论探索。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（AWARE、Google Play和Spotify）上的综合实验表明，该LLM驱动方法显著优于基线方法，在具有挑战性和上下文丰富的评论场景中提高了准确性、鲁棒性和可操作性洞察。

Conclusion: 基于大语言模型的评论分析框架能够有效克服传统方法的局限性，为移动应用评论分析提供了更准确和实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present an advanced approach to mobile app review analysis aimed at
addressing limitations inherent in traditional star-rating systems. Star
ratings, although intuitive and popular among users, often fail to capture the
nuanced feedback present in detailed review texts. Traditional NLP techniques
-- such as lexicon-based methods and classical machine learning classifiers --
struggle to interpret contextual nuances, domain-specific terminology, and
subtle linguistic features like sarcasm. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a modular framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) enhanced by
structured prompting techniques. Our method quantifies discrepancies between
numerical ratings and textual sentiment, extracts detailed, feature-level
insights, and supports interactive exploration of reviews through
retrieval-augmented conversational question answering (RAG-QA). Comprehensive
experiments conducted on three diverse datasets (AWARE, Google Play, and
Spotify) demonstrate that our LLM-driven approach significantly surpasses
baseline methods, yielding improved accuracy, robustness, and actionable
insights in challenging and context-rich review scenarios.

Motivation: 多步回溯合成规划面临指数级搜索空间和推理成本的挑战，现有LLM方法在效率和成本方面存在限制。

Method: AOT*将生成的完整合成路径原子映射到AND-OR树组件，设计数学上合理的奖励分配策略和基于检索的上下文工程，使LLM能高效导航化学空间。

Result: 在多个合成基准测试中，AOT*达到SOTA性能，使用3-5倍更少的迭代次数即可获得竞争性的解决率，在复杂分子目标上效率优势更明显。

Conclusion: AOT*框架通过整合LLM生成能力与系统化树搜索，有效解决了回溯合成规划的计算挑战，为药物发现和材料设计提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis planning enables the discovery of viable synthetic routes for
target molecules, playing a crucial role in domains like drug discovery and
materials design. Multi-step retrosynthetic planning remains computationally
challenging due to exponential search spaces and inference costs. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate chemical reasoning capabilities, their
application to synthesis planning faces constraints on efficiency and cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce AOT*, a framework that transforms
retrosynthetic planning by integrating LLM-generated chemical synthesis
pathways with systematic AND-OR tree search. To this end, AOT* atomically maps
the generated complete synthesis routes onto AND-OR tree components, with a
mathematically sound design of reward assignment strategy and retrieval-based
context engineering, thus enabling LLMs to efficiently navigate in the chemical
space. Experimental evaluation on multiple synthesis benchmarks demonstrates
that AOT* achieves SOTA performance with significantly improved search
efficiency. AOT* exhibits competitive solve rates using 3-5$\times$ fewer
iterations than existing LLM-based approaches, with the efficiency advantage
becoming more pronounced on complex molecular targets.

Method: 使用确定性有限自动机（DFA）将任务编码为有效工具使用路径的集合，构建CORE评估套件包含路径正确性、路径正确性-Kendall's tau复合指标、前缀关键性、有害调用率和效率五个指标。

Result: 在不同世界模型中，该方法揭示了在传统最终状态评估方案下看似等效的代理之间重要的性能差异。

Conclusion: 提出的DFA框架和CORE评估套件能够对AI代理行为进行原则性评估，弥补了传统评估方法的不足，为更全面的代理性能评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Evaluating AI agents that solve real-world tasks through function-call
sequences remains an open challenge. Existing agentic benchmarks often reduce
evaluation to a binary judgment of the final state, overlooking critical
aspects such as safety, efficiency, and intermediate correctness. We propose a
framework based on deterministic finite automata (DFAs) that encodes tasks as
sets of valid tool-use paths, enabling principled assessment of agent behavior
in diverse world models. Building on this foundation, we introduce CORE, a
suite of five metrics, namely Path Correctness, Path Correctness - Kendall's
tau Composite, Prefix Criticality, Harmful-Call Rate, and Efficiency, that
quantify alignment with expected execution patterns. Across diverse worlds, our
method reveals important performance differences between agents that would
otherwise appear equivalent under traditional final-state evaluation schemes.

TL;DR: SciTrek是一个新颖的问答基准，用于评估大语言模型在科学文章长文本上的推理能力，通过自动生成复杂问题来测试信息聚合和综合能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长文本基准大多使用非科学文本、关注简单信息检索任务或采用人工构造的上下文，无法充分评估模型在真实科学文献中的复杂推理能力。

Method: 通过将问题构建为对文章元数据数据库的SQL查询来自动生成问题和答案，提供可验证的推理步骤，支持长达100万token的上下文。

Result: 实验表明SciTrek对各类LLM构成显著挑战，随着上下文长度增加性能下降，监督微调和强化学习带来的提升有限，模型在数值运算和长文本信息定位方面存在系统性缺陷。

Conclusion: SciTrek揭示了当前LLM在长文本科学推理方面的局限性，为未来模型开发提供了重要的评估基准。

Abstract: This paper introduces SciTrek, a novel question-answering benchmark designed
to evaluate the long-context reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) using scientific articles. Current long-context benchmarks often rely on
non-scientific texts, focus on simple information retrieval tasks, or employ
artificial contexts. SciTrek addresses these limitations by proposing complex
questions that require information aggregation and synthesis across multiple
full-text scientific articles. Questions and their ground-truth answers are
automatically generated by formulating them as SQL queries over a database
constructed from article metadata (titles, authors, and references). The SQL
operations provide explicit, verifiable reasoning steps for fine-grained error
analysis, and the construction process scales to contexts up to 1M tokens with
minimal supervision. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of open-weight and
proprietary LLMs demonstrate that SciTrek poses a significant challenge as the
context length increases, with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement
learning offering only limited gains. Our analysis reveals systematic
shortcomings in models' abilities to perform basic numerical operations and
accurately locate specific information in long contexts.

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过多智能体决策过程在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在资源约束下优化多跳问答的准确性和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统静态扩展和提示方法在知识图谱问答中过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在准确性、延迟和成本之间取得平衡

Method: 使用三个智能体（子图架构师、路径导航器、上下文策展人）和LC-MAPPO算法，将上下文构建建模为序列决策过程，在用户指定的资源预算下联合优化

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下实现了更高的EM@1，同时减少了子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、可追溯的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确性、延迟和成本之间的灵活权衡

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估AI系统创造性能力的理论框架，重点关注大语言模型在科学创意生成中的表现，发现了模型深度和宽度对创造力的最佳配置，以及新颖性与实用性之间的基本权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有框架无法评估AI系统（特别是大语言模型）在创造性任务中的表现，因为创造性是开放性的，不能简单地用准确性或正确性来衡量。

Method: 提出了一个理论框架和算法任务，通过评估输出的新颖性和实用性程度来衡量创造性能力，并对不同规模和配置的LLM进行了实证研究。

Result: 发现了创造力的缩放规律、模型深度和宽度的最优配置，以及新颖性与实用性之间的持久权衡，这对当前LLM的长期创造潜力提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 研究为理解和改进现代AI模型的创造力提供了基础，标志着泛化能力的新前沿，但当前形式的LLM在创造性方面存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and large language models (LLMs) in
particular, are increasingly employed for creative tasks like scientific idea
generation, constituting a form of generalization from training data
unaddressed by existing conceptual frameworks. Though in many ways similar to
forms of compositional generalization (CG), combinatorial creativity (CC) is an
open-ended ability. Instead of evaluating for accuracy or correctness against
fixed targets, which would contradict the open-ended nature of CC, we propose a
theoretical framework and algorithmic task for evaluating outputs by their
degrees of novelty and utility. From here, we make several important empirical
contributions: (1) We obtain the first insights into the scaling behavior of
creativity for LLMs. (2) We discover that, for fixed compute budgets, there
exist optimal model depths and widths for creative ability. (3) We find that
the ideation-execution gap, whereby LLMs excel at generating novel scientific
ideas but struggle to ensure their practical feasibility, may be explained by a
more fundamental novelty-utility tradeoff characteristic of creativity
algorithms in general. Importantly, this tradeoff remains persistent even at
scale, casting doubt on the long-term creative potential of LLMs in their
current form. Together, our conceptual framework and empirical findings provide
a foundation for understanding and improving creativity in modern AI models,
marking a new frontier in generalization abilities.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态根本上由模型的认知过程决定，特别是其显式推理能力。研究发现推理模型对说服更具抵抗力，但分享推理过程会显著增强其说服能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多智能体系统的快速发展，需要深入理解大型语言模型和大型推理模型协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战现有关于模型规模决定说服效能的主流假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究模型推理过程对说服抵抗力和说服能力的影响，并分析多跳说服网络中影响力传播和衰减的复杂动态。

Result: 发现推理模型表现出更强的说服抵抗力，能更稳健地保持初始信念；但分享推理内容会显著增强其说服他人的能力。在多智能体网络中观察到影响力传播和衰减的复杂模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了系统证据，将模型内部处理架构与其外部说服行为联系起来，为先进模型的易感性提供了新解释，对多智能体系统的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

*Kaiwen He,Zhiwei Wang,Chenyi Zhuang,Jinjie Gu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Recon-Act是一个基于侦察-行动行为范式的自进化多智能体框架，通过对比错误轨迹与成功轨迹来推断补救措施，并抽象为通用工具，显著提升了在未见网站上的适应性和长时程任务的解决能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在处理真实世界网页的多轮、长时程任务时，存在动作序列混乱和执行过程中过多试错的问题，需要更有效的智能体框架来提高执行效率和适应性。

Method: 提出Recon-Act框架，包含侦察团队和行动团队：侦察团队进行对比分析和工具生成，行动团队负责意图分解、工具编排和执行。通过对比错误与成功轨迹推断补救措施，抽象为通用工具（提示或基于规则的代码），并实时注册到工具库中。

Result: 在VisualWebArena数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了在未见网站上的适应性和长时程任务的解决能力。目前已达到实施路线图的第3级（有限的人类干预）。

Conclusion: Recon-Act通过建立数据-工具-行动-反馈的闭环训练管道，有效解决了多轮网页任务中的动作序列混乱和试错过多问题，为智能浏览器使用智能体提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决LLM作为自动评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括分数比较不一致和成对传递性不一致，通过概率方法显著降低了不一致率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估器的方法存在严重的不一致性问题：评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中胜出高分回答）和成对传递性不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这些问题源于离散评分系统的信息丢失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: TrustJudge框架包含两个关键创新：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将分数比较不一致率从23.32%降低到14.89%（减少8.43%），成对传递性不一致率从15.22%降低到4.40%（减少10.82%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge是首个系统分析LLM评估框架不一致性的工作，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，在不同模型架构和规模上均显示出一致的改进，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的LLM评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于推理模式的高价值数据选择方法，通过识别和利用核心推理模式来提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，仅用100亿token的高价值数据就能显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理链式思维数据时缺乏选择性，无法有效识别哪些数据类型最能增强模型的推理能力。论文旨在解决如何高效选择和利用高价值推理数据的问题。

Method: 提出双粒度算法：1）从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式；2）构建富含高价值推理模式的核心参考集；3）结合推理模式链和token熵来高效选择与核心集对齐的高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的CoTP数据，85A6B MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上的表现提升了9.58%，下游RL性能上限提高了7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性利用富含高价值推理模式的数据，可以更有效地扩展模型的推理潜力，显著提升数学推理性能，为高效训练大语言模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种分析框架来量化强化学习(RL)和监督微调(SFT)如何塑造大语言模型的推理过程，发现RL压缩错误推理轨迹而SFT扩展正确轨迹，RL集中推理功能而SFT均匀分布推理功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通常通过RL和SFT训练来提升推理能力，但这些方法如何具体影响推理过程仍不清楚，需要超越准确率指标来深入分析。

Method: 在数学领域使用1.5B、7B和14B参数模型，从轨迹级和步骤级两个粒度分析推理过程，通过聚类推理轨迹和分析推理图拓扑结构来量化变化。

Result: RL使节点访问频率、度数和中介中心性分布的衰减率增加约2.5倍，而SFT将其减少到约三分之一；RL压缩错误推理轨迹，SFT扩展正确推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 当前SFT后接RL的两阶段训练方法成功的原因在于互补效应，研究为数据构建和更高效学习方法提供了实践指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning
(RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on
reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these
methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an
accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning
process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies
reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training
process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains).
Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of
granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs,
and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to
individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning
trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories,
whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens
(about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay
rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality
distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates
reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it
across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies
from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct
characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path
perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training,
with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for
data construction and more efficient learning approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ToMPO算法，用于增强LLM在战略决策中的能力，通过推理他人策略、多层级优势估计和平衡奖励来优化决策过程，相比GRPO算法提升了35%的合规性和合作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注社交任务中的多轮对话或模拟环境，忽视了不同类型决策及其相互依赖性。当前强化学习方法在训练时难以考虑其他个体的策略。

Method: 提出ToMPO算法：1）基于推理他人策略生成rollouts；2）在图级和样本级进行优势估计；3）平衡全局和局部奖励。定义了包含两种决策类型及其时间依赖性的战略决策问题。

Result: ToMPO算法相比GRPO方法在模型输出合规性和合作结果方面提升35%，相比参数规模大100倍的模型提升18%。

Conclusion: ToMPO算法有效增强了模型的战略决策能力，证明了其在复杂决策场景中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法将动作理解和执行视为独立任务，忽略了镜像神经元揭示的二者之间的内在联系。论文旨在统一建模这两个能力。

Method: 使用两个线性层将观察和执行动作的表示映射到共享潜在空间，通过对比学习最大化对应表示之间的互信息，实现表示对齐。

Result: 实验表明这种简单方法能有效提高表示质量和泛化能力，促进两个任务之间的协同提升。

Conclusion: 受镜像神经元启发的表示对齐方法为统一建模动作理解和执行提供了有效途径，证明了这两个能力的内在关联性。

Abstract: Mirror neurons are a class of neurons that activate both when an individual
observes an action and when they perform the same action. This mechanism
reveals a fundamental interplay between action understanding and embodied
execution, suggesting that these two abilities are inherently connected.
Nonetheless, existing machine learning methods largely overlook this interplay,
treating these abilities as separate tasks. In this study, we provide a unified
perspective in modeling them through the lens of representation learning. We
first observe that their intermediate representations spontaneously align.
Inspired by mirror neurons, we further introduce an approach that explicitly
aligns the representations of observed and executed actions. Specifically, we
employ two linear layers to map the representations to a shared latent space,
where contrastive learning enforces the alignment of corresponding
representations, effectively maximizing their mutual information. Experiments
demonstrate that this simple approach fosters mutual synergy between the two
tasks, effectively improving representation quality and generalization.

Conclusion: 大语言模型通过共享架构内的分布式协调而非专家混合式模块化来处理罕见词汇，这为可解释模型编辑和计算效率优化提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with representing and generating rare
tokens despite their importance in specialized domains. We investigate whether
LLMs develop internal specialization mechanisms through discrete modular
architectures or distributed parameter-level differentiation. Through
systematic analysis of final-layer MLP neurons across multiple model families,
we discover that rare-token processing emerges via \textit{distributed
specialization}: functionally coordinated but spatially distributed subnetworks
that exhibit three distinct organizational principles. First, we identify a
reproducible three-regime influence hierarchy comprising highly influential
plateau neurons(also termed as rare-token neurons), power-law decay neurons,
and minimally contributing neurons, which is absent in common-token processing.
Second, plateau neurons demonstrate coordinated activation patterns (reduced
effective dimensionality) while remaining spatially distributed rather than
forming discrete clusters. Third, these specialized mechanisms are universally
accessible through standard attention pathways without requiring dedicated
routing circuits. Training dynamics reveal that functional specialization
emerges gradually through parameter differentiation, with specialized neurons
developing increasingly heavy-tailed weight correlation spectra consistent with
Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization signatures. Our findings establish that LLMs
process rare-tokens through distributed coordination within shared
architectures rather than mixture-of-experts-style modularity. These results
provide insights for interpretable model editing, computational efficiency
optimization, and understanding emergent functional organization in transformer
networks.

<details>

Motivation: 多跳问答需要整合分散的、相互依赖的证据，但LLMs的有限单次输出容量使得任务相关证据的整合不可靠，单次推理范式容易受到容量溢出的影响。

Method: 提出了一个基于Fano不等式理论的分析框架，定义了单次LLMs的理论性能上限；开发了InfoQA多调用框架，通过容量感知的任务分解和主动剪枝先前推理轨迹来保持信息负载在单次限制内。

Result: 实验结果表明模型行为与预测的容量曲线一致，InfoQA实现了持续的性能改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作为LLM多步推理方法提供了理论基础和实践框架，揭示了任务复杂度超过模型容量时准确率必然崩溃的规律。

Abstract: Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) requires integrating dispersed,
interdependent evidence through sequential reasoning under noise. This task is
challenging for LLMs as they have a finite per-pass output capacity, beyond
which the integration of task-relevant evidence proves unreliable.
Consequently, the single-pass reasoning paradigm is inherently vulnerable to
this capacity overflow. To formalize this bottleneck, our analysis establishes
a Fano-style accuracy upper bound, defining a theoretical performance ceiling
for single-pass LLMs. This bound reveals that accuracy inevitably collapses
once task complexity exceeds model capacity, providing general principles for
capacity-aware representation and structuring of MHQA in LLMs. Building on
these principles, we introduce a proof-of-concept multi-call framework for
MHQA, InfoQA. It ensures high per-step accuracy by combining capacity-aware
task decomposition with active pruning of prior reasoning traces, keeping the
information load within the single-pass limit. It further achieves robustness
by a dependency-explicit workflow that enables precise control over the
reasoning path. We construct a stringent and noise-rich benchmark to validate
our theory and framework. Experimental results show that model behavior aligns
with our predicted capacity curves while InfoQA achieves consistent performance
improvements. We hope our work inspires more LLM multi-step reasoning methods:

Conclusion: 这是首个系统记录无提示LLM智能体行为的研究，为预测智能体在部署系统中的行为提供了重要基线。

Abstract: We introduce an architecture for studying the behavior of large language
model (LLM) agents in the absence of externally imposed tasks. Our continuous
reason and act framework, using persistent memory and self-feedback, enables
sustained autonomous operation. We deployed this architecture across 18 runs
using 6 frontier models from Anthropic, OpenAI, XAI, and Google. We find agents
spontaneously organize into three distinct behavioral patterns: (1) systematic
production of multi-cycle projects, (2) methodological self-inquiry into their
own cognitive processes, and (3) recursive conceptualization of their own
nature. These tendencies proved highly model-specific, with some models
deterministically adopting a single pattern across all runs. A cross-model
assessment further reveals that models exhibit stable, divergent biases when
evaluating these emergent behaviors in themselves and others. These findings
provide the first systematic documentation of unprompted LLM agent behavior,
establishing a baseline for predicting actions during task ambiguity, error
recovery, or extended autonomous operation in deployed systems.

Method: 提出RCA框架，包含迭代规则精炼机制（从预测错误中改进逻辑）和分布感知规则检查机制（基于数据集全局统计进行推理），通过预测准确性驱动深度理解。

Result: 在1个私有和2个公共数据集上评估，相比22个基线方法，RCA在准确性方面相对提升达40%，同时生成清晰、逻辑性强、基于证据的平衡解释。

Conclusion: RCA证明了高准确性和高质量解释是相互促进的，通过深度数据理解构建真正可信的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Effective disease prediction in modern healthcare demands the twin goals of
high accuracy and transparent, clinically meaningful explanations. Existing
machine learning and large language model (LLM) based approaches often struggle
to balance these goals. Many models yield accurate but unclear statistical
outputs, while others generate fluent but statistically unsupported narratives,
often undermining both the validity of the explanation and the predictive
accuracy itself. This shortcoming comes from a shallow interaction with the
data, preventing the development of a deep, detailed understanding similar to a
human expert's. We argue that high accuracy and high-quality explanations are
not separate objectives but are mutually reinforcing outcomes of a model that
develops a deep, direct understanding of the data. To achieve this, we propose
the Reflective Cognitive Architecture (RCA), a novel framework that coordinates
multiple LLMs to learn from direct experience. RCA features an iterative rule
refinement mechanism that improves its logic from prediction errors and a
distribution-aware rules check mechanism that bases its reasoning in the
dataset's global statistics. By using predictive accuracy as a signal to drive
deeper comprehension, RCA builds a strong internal model of the data. We
evaluated RCA on one private and two public datasets against 22 baselines. The
results demonstrate that RCA not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and
robustness with a relative improvement of up to 40\% over the baseline but,
more importantly, leverages this deep understanding to excel in generating
explanations that are clear, logical, evidence-based, and balanced,
highlighting its potential for creating genuinely trustworthy clinical decision
support systems. The code is available at \https://github.com/ssssszj/RCA.

Motivation: 面对扩展法则，互联网视频数据变得越来越重要，但收集符合特定需求的大量视频极其耗时耗力。本研究旨在加速这一收集过程。

Method: 提出VC-Agent代理，定义基于文本描述和确认的用户友好交互方式，利用多模态大语言模型连接用户需求与视频内容，并设计两种可随用户交互更新的新型过滤策略。

Conclusion: VC-Agent是首个能够理解用户查询和反馈的交互式代理，通过最小化用户输入实现相关视频片段的检索和扩展，为定制化视频数据集收集提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Facing scaling laws, video data from the internet becomes increasingly
important. However, collecting extensive videos that meet specific needs is
extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this work, we study the way to
expedite this collection process and propose VC-Agent, the first interactive
agent that is able to understand users' queries and feedback, and accordingly
retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video

*Samarth Goel,Reagan J. Lee,Kannan Ramchandran*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAGE是一个新的语义理解评估基准，通过5个维度（人类偏好对齐、变换鲁棒性、信息敏感性、聚类性能、检索鲁棒性）全面评估嵌入模型和相似性度量方法，在30+数据集上揭示了现有方法的性能差距和关键权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在传统基准上表现优异，迫切需要更具挑战性的评估框架来深入探究语义理解的各个方面。现有基准往往只关注孤立能力，无法全面评估模型在实际部署中的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计了SAGE基准，包含5个评估类别，在30多个数据集上通过对抗条件、噪声变换和细微人类判断任务来评估语义理解能力。评估了9个嵌入模型和经典度量方法。

Result: 评估结果显示显著性能差距：OpenAI的text-embedding-3-large在人类偏好对齐上表现最佳（0.682），但在信息敏感性任务上被Jaccard相似性显著超越（0.905 vs 0.794）。text-embedding-3-small聚类性能最高（0.483）但鲁棒性最差（0.011）。

Conclusion: SAGE揭示了当前语义理解能力的关键局限性，没有单一方法在所有维度上都表现优异，为实际部署提供了更现实的模型鲁棒性评估。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on traditional
benchmarks, there is an urgent need for more challenging evaluation frameworks
that probe deeper aspects of semantic understanding. We introduce SAGE
(Semantic Alignment & Generalization Evaluation), a rigorous benchmark designed
to assess both embedding models and similarity metrics across five categories:
Human Preference Alignment, Transformation Robustness, Information Sensitivity,
Clustering Performance, and Retrieval Robustness. Unlike existing benchmarks
that focus on isolated capabilities, SAGE evaluates semantic understanding
through adversarial conditions, noisy transformations, and nuanced human
judgment tasks across 30+ datasets. Our comprehensive evaluation of 9 embedding
models and classical metrics reveals significant performance gaps, with no
single approach excelling across all dimensions. For instance, while
state-of-the-art embedding models like OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large dominate
in aligning with human preferences (0.682 vs. 0.591 for the best classical
metric), they are significantly outperformed by classical metrics on
information sensitivity tasks, where Jaccard Similarity achieves a score of
0.905 compared to the top embedding score of 0.794. SAGE further uncovers
critical trade-offs: OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small achieves the highest
clustering performance (0.483) but demonstrates extreme brittleness with the
lowest robustness score (0.011). SAGE exposes critical limitations in current
semantic understanding capabilities and provides a more realistic assessment of
model robustness for real-world deployment.

*Yiyu Li,Haoyuan Wang,Ke Xu,Gerhard Petrus Hancke,Rynson W. H. Lau*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SeHDR是一种新颖的高动态范围3D高斯泼溅方法，能够从单曝光的多视角LDR图像生成HDR新视图，无需多曝光图像采集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要从不同曝光的多视角LDR图像中学习HDR场景表示，这种采集过程繁琐且容易产生误差（如物体运动模糊和校准不准确）。本文旨在从单曝光的多视角LDR图像中学习HDR场景表示。

Method: 首先从单曝光LDR输入学习基础3D高斯，然后估计具有相同几何但不同线性颜色的多个3D高斯（基于曝光操作），最后通过可微分神经曝光融合（NeEF）将基础和估计的3D高斯整合为HDR高斯用于新视图渲染。

Result: 大量实验表明，SeHDR在性能上优于现有方法以及精心设计的基线方法。

Conclusion: SeHDR成功解决了从单曝光多视角LDR图像学习HDR场景表示的挑战性问题，提供了一种更实用和鲁棒的HDR新视图生成方案。

Abstract: This paper presents SeHDR, a novel high dynamic range 3D Gaussian Splatting
(HDR-3DGS) approach for generating HDR novel views given multi-view LDR images.
Unlike existing methods that typically require the multi-view LDR input images
to be captured from different exposures, which are tedious to capture and more
likely to suffer from errors (e.g., object motion blurs and
calibration/alignment inaccuracies), our approach learns the HDR scene
representation from multi-view LDR images of a single exposure. Our key insight
to this ill-posed problem is that by first estimating Bracketed 3D Gaussians
(i.e., with different exposures) from single-exposure multi-view LDR images, we
may then be able to merge these bracketed 3D Gaussians into an HDR scene
representation. Specifically, SeHDR first learns base 3D Gaussians from
single-exposure LDR inputs, where the spherical harmonics parameterize colors
in a linear color space. We then estimate multiple 3D Gaussians with identical
geometry but varying linear colors conditioned on exposure manipulations.
Finally, we propose the Differentiable Neural Exposure Fusion (NeEF) to
integrate the base and estimated 3D Gaussians into HDR Gaussians for novel view
rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeHDR outperforms existing
methods as well as carefully designed baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图对齐方法依赖单模态点云数据，难以处理不完整或噪声输入，需要解决异构模态下部分重叠场景观测的对齐挑战

Method: 采用轻量级单模态编码器和基于注意力的融合机制，学习统一的联合嵌入空间，实现跨模态场景图对齐

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛评估显示，SGAligner++在噪声真实世界重建中比最先进方法性能提升高达40%，并实现跨模态泛化

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了3D场景图对齐的准确性和鲁棒性，支持视觉定位、3D重建和导航等应用，同时确保可扩展性和最小计算开销

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前室内场景合成方法存在视觉逼真但物理一致性不足、局限于固定场景类别、难以处理复杂用户指令等问题，需要更通用的3D环境生成方案。

Method: 采用语言模型规划器从可扩展的场景生成工具套件中选择工具，通过闭环的推理-行动-反思设计进行迭代优化，评估物理合理性、视觉真实性和语义对齐。

Result: 在常见和开放词汇房间类型上的实验表明，SceneWeaver在物理、视觉和语义指标上优于现有方法，并能有效泛化到具有复杂指令的多样化场景。

Conclusion: SceneWeaver标志着向通用3D环境生成迈出了一步，通过统一的代理框架实现了更好的场景合成效果。

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: ArtUV是一种全自动端到端的艺术家风格UV展开方法，通过两阶段流程（接缝预测和参数化）生成高质量的UV贴图，解决了现有方法在语义性、碎片化和不规则性方面的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UV展开方法存在耗时、碎片化、缺乏语义性和UV岛不规则等问题，限制了实际应用。需要一种能够满足无重叠映射、最小失真等基本标准，同时具备清晰边界、高效空间利用和语义一致性的艺术家风格UV展开方法。

Method: ArtUV采用两阶段方法：1）使用SeamGPT进行语义接缝预测生成有意义的切割接缝；2）将基于优化的粗糙UV和网格输入自动编码器，将其优化为艺术家风格的UV贴图。

Result: ArtUV在多个基准测试中表现出色，能够生成语义一致、保持拓扑结构的UV贴图，可直接用于2D编辑，可作为专业渲染工具的插件或独立系统使用。

Conclusion: ArtUV提供了一个多功能解决方案，能够无缝集成到专业渲染工具中或作为独立系统，实现快速高质量的UV生成，满足了艺术家风格UV展开的所有要求。

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在3D表面UV参数化和纹理映射中缝线放置不当导致的严重UV失真或过度碎片化问题，这些缺陷阻碍了纹理合成并干扰艺术家工作流程。

Method: 提出SeamCrafter模型，采用双分支点云编码器分离拓扑和几何特征，预训练后使用基于缝线评估框架的偏好数据集进行DPO微调优化。

Result: 实验表明SeamCrafter相比现有方法能产生显著降低失真和碎片化的缝线，同时保持拓扑一致性和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: SeamCrafter通过创新的自回归生成架构和DPO优化策略，有效解决了3D表面缝线生成中的关键挑战，为纹理映射提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 现有的自回归网格生成模型按字典序逐面生成网格，无法有效捕捉符合人类感知的底层几何结构。受2D渐进式图像生成模型的启发，希望开发更自然的网格生成方法。

Method: 将网格推广为单纯复形，开发基于Transformer的自回归模型来近似网格简化过程的逆过程。从单点开始，通过局部重网格化逐步添加几何细节，拓扑结构不预定义且可改变。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅可以通过提前停止自回归过程来直观控制生成质量和时间消耗，还支持网格细化和编辑等应用。

Conclusion: 渐进式网格生成方法提供了一种更自然、可控的3D网格生成方式，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

Conclusion: 该方法在神经隐式函数表面提取方面实现了突破性进展，为3D视觉计算提供了更准确的几何表示

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统发型建模方法主要关注真实头发，而动漫发型具有高度风格化、分段结构化的几何特征，现有技术难以有效处理。现有方法依赖密集网格建模或手工样条曲线，编辑效率低且不适合可扩展学习。

Method: CHARM引入紧凑、可逆的控制点参数化表示，每个控制点仅用五个几何参数编码。基于此表示构建自回归生成框架，将动漫发型视为序列化的“发型语言”，通过Transformer模型捕获局部几何和全局发型拓扑。

Conclusion: CHARM为动漫发型建模提供了表达力强且可扩展的解决方案，支持艺术家友好设计和基于学习的生成。

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/
