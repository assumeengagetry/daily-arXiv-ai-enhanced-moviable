### [1] [Enhancing Maritime Object Detection in Real-Time with RT-DETR and Data Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07346)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于RT-DETR的实时海上目标检测系统，通过合成图像增强和多尺度特征融合等技术，解决了小目标检测和真实数据不足的问题，在保持实时性能的同时提升了检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海上目标检测面临小目标尺寸和真实RGB标注数据有限的挑战，需要开发能够在真实数据上严格评估的实时检测系统。

Method: 采用RT-DETR架构，结合多尺度特征融合、不确定性最小化查询选择和合成-真实样本权重平衡策略，使用数据增强技术平衡数据集类别。

Result: 开发了完整的Python鲁棒海上检测流水线，在保持实时性能的同时验证了各模块的贡献，并测试了在极端光照和海况下的系统表现。

Conclusion: 该系统在保持DETR端到端集合预测优势的同时，允许用户在推理时调整速度与精度平衡，并通过组件分析量化了各架构模块的贡献。

Abstract: Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target
size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a
real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing
augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study
employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature
fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between
synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the
detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most
reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap
between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined
end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and
accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to
balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and
accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime
detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under
practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the
system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also
includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each
architectural module and explore its interactions.

### [2] [DynamicEval: Rethinking Evaluation for Dynamic Text-to-Video Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07441)
*Nithin C. Babu,Aniruddha Mahapatra,Harsh Rangwani,Rajiv Soundararajan,Kuldeep Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DynamicEval基准，专注于动态相机运动的文本到视频评估，包含45k人工标注和新的背景一致性、前景一致性指标，在视频级和模型级评估上比现有方法提升2%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V评估基准存在两个局限：一是忽视动态相机运动的重要性，二是仅关注模型级评分而忽略视频级评估。

Method: 构建包含动态相机运动提示词的基准，收集45k人工标注；提出基于对象错误图的背景一致性指标和基于点跟踪的前景一致性指标。

Result: 新指标在视频级和模型级评估中与人类偏好相关性更强，提升超过2个百分点。

Conclusion: DynamicEval为动态相机运动下的T2V模型评估提供了更全面的基准。

Abstract: Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and
EvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on
subject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for
producing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely
unexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a
single model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,
however, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the
better video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To
address these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of
systematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with
45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V
models. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background
scene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene
consistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion
smoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric
shows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:
occlusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.
Building on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages
object error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our
second innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that
tracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object
fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed metrics achieve
stronger correlations with human preferences at both the video level and the
model level (an improvement of more than 2% points), establishing DynamicEval
as a more comprehensive benchmark for evaluating T2V models under dynamic
camera motion.

### [3] [Provably Accelerated Imaging with Restarted Inertia and Score-based Image Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07470)
*Marien Renaud,Julien Hermant,Deliang Wei,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RISP方法，通过重启惯性机制加速收敛，同时使用基于分数的图像先验保证重建质量，在非凸先验下获得比RED更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如RED专注于设计复杂图像先验来提高重建质量，但收敛加速依赖于启发式方法，需要弥补这一差距。

Method: 在RED基础上引入重启惯性机制，结合基于分数的图像先验，并分析了相关的连续时间动力系统。

Result: 实验证明RISP在多种成像逆问题中实现了快速收敛和高质量重建。

Conclusion: RISP为成像逆问题提供了既快速收敛又高质量重建的解决方案，建立了与重球ODE的理论联系。

Abstract: Fast convergence and high-quality image recovery are two essential features
of algorithms for solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems. Existing methods,
such as regularization by denoising (RED), often focus on designing
sophisticated image priors to improve reconstruction quality, while leaving
convergence acceleration to heuristics. To bridge the gap, we propose Restarted
Inertia with Score-based Priors (RISP) as a principled extension of RED. RISP
incorporates a restarting inertia for fast convergence, while still allowing
score-based image priors for high-quality reconstruction. We prove that RISP
attains a faster stationary-point convergence rate than RED, without requiring
the convexity of the image prior. We further derive and analyze the associated
continuous-time dynamical system, offering insight into the connection between
RISP and the heavy-ball ordinary differential equation (ODE). Experiments
across a range of imaging inverse problems demonstrate that RISP enables fast
convergence while achieving high-quality reconstructions.

### [4] [A Denoising Framework for Real-World Ultra-Low Dose Lung CT Images Based on an Image Purification Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07492)
*Guoliang Gong,Man Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于图像纯化策略的创新去噪框架，解决超低剂量CT图像的空间错位问题，结合频域流匹配模型在真实临床数据集上取得SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT显著降低辐射暴露但引入严重噪声和伪影，导致与正常剂量CT图像对之间存在显著空间错位，现有去噪网络难以直接应用。

Method: 提出图像纯化策略生成结构对齐的uLDCT-NDCT图像对，并设计频域流匹配模型协同工作，保持去噪图像的解剖结构完整性。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上，IP策略显著提升多个主流去噪模型性能，FFM模型结合IP策略在解剖结构保持方面达到SOTA效果。

Conclusion: 本研究为真实世界uLDCT去噪中的数据不匹配问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-low dose CT (uLDCT) significantly reduces radiation exposure but
introduces severe noise and artifacts. It also leads to substantial spatial
misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses
challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on
synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT
denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an
Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT
lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates
structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data
foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a
Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with
the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of
denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our
IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream
denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined
with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical
structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data
mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available

### [5] [D2RA: Dual Domain Regeneration Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07538)
*Pragati Shuddhodhan Meshram,Varun Chandrasekaran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D2RA是一种无需训练的单图像攻击方法，能够在资源受限的对抗环境下有效移除或削弱生成模型中的水印，揭示了当前水印设计的基本弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型的广泛使用，确保内容归属和溯源的水印方法变得日益重要。尽管现有的语义水印方案通过在潜在或频域表示中嵌入信号来提高鲁棒性，但在资源受限的对抗环境下仍然存在脆弱性。

Method: D2RA是一种无需训练、无需访问底层模型的单图像攻击方法。通过将带水印图像投影到互补表示的自然先验上，该方法在保持视觉保真度的同时抑制水印信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，D2RA能够持续降低多种水印方案的可检测性，有效证明了当前水印设计的基本弱点。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前水印方案在对抗攻击下的脆弱性，强调了需要更鲁棒的水印设计来应对实际应用中的安全威胁。

Abstract: The growing use of generative models has intensified the need for
watermarking methods that ensure content attribution and provenance. While
recent semantic watermarking schemes improve robustness by embedding signals in
latent or frequency representations, we show they remain vulnerable even under
resource-constrained adversarial settings. We present D2RA, a training-free,
single-image attack that removes or weakens watermarks without access to the
underlying model. By projecting watermarked images onto natural priors across
complementary representations, D2RA suppresses watermark signals while
preserving visual fidelity. Experiments across diverse watermarking schemes
demonstrate that our approach consistently reduces watermark detectability,
revealing fundamental weaknesses in current designs. Our code is available at
https://github.com/Pragati-Meshram/DAWN.

### [6] [PickStyle: Video-to-Video Style Transfer with Context-Style Adapters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07546)
*Soroush Mehraban,Vida Adeli,Jacob Rommann,Babak Taati,Kyryl Truskovskyi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PickStyle是一个视频风格迁移框架，通过插入低秩适配器和构造合成训练数据，在保持视频内容的同时实现文本指定的风格转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频风格迁移面临缺乏配对视频数据监督的挑战，需要解决静态图像监督与动态视频之间的差距。

Method: 在预训练视频扩散模型中插入低秩适配器，利用配对静态图像数据训练，通过共享增强模拟相机运动构建合成训练片段，并提出上下文-风格分类器自由引导（CS-CFG）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法实现了时间一致、风格忠实且内容保留的视频转换，在定性和定量评估上都优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PickStyle通过有效的适配器设计和训练策略，成功解决了视频风格迁移中的数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的风格转换效果。

Abstract: We address the task of video style transfer with diffusion models, where the
goal is to preserve the context of an input video while rendering it in a
target style specified by a text prompt. A major challenge is the lack of
paired video data for supervision. We propose PickStyle, a video-to-video style
transfer framework that augments pretrained video diffusion backbones with
style adapters and benefits from paired still image data with source-style
correspondences for training. PickStyle inserts low-rank adapters into the
self-attention layers of conditioning modules, enabling efficient
specialization for motion-style transfer while maintaining strong alignment
between video content and style. To bridge the gap between static image
supervision and dynamic video, we construct synthetic training clips from
paired images by applying shared augmentations that simulate camera motion,
ensuring temporal priors are preserved. In addition, we introduce Context-Style
Classifier-Free Guidance (CS-CFG), a novel factorization of classifier-free
guidance into independent text (style) and video (context) directions. CS-CFG
ensures that context is preserved in generated video while the style is
effectively transferred. Experiments across benchmarks show that our approach
achieves temporally coherent, style-faithful, and content-preserving video
translations, outperforming existing baselines both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

### [7] [TRAVL: A Recipe for Making Video-Language Models Better Judges of Physics Implausibility](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07550)
*Saman Motamed,Minghao Chen,Luc Van Gool,Iro Laina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出TRAVL方法，通过平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块来改进视频语言模型的物理合理性判断能力，并创建了ImplausiBench基准来评估物理推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视频生成模型经常产生违反物理规律的序列，但目前缺乏量化评估物理真实性的方法。现有视频语言模型在识别物理违规方面存在困难。

Method: 引入TRAVL微调方法，结合平衡训练数据集和轨迹感知注意力模块，改进运动编码和判别能力。同时提出ImplausiBench基准，包含300个视频（150个真实，150个生成）。

Result: TRAVL和ImplausiBench为多模态模型提供了一个统一的框架，用于探索和改进物理合理性，揭示了视觉-时间理解中具有挑战性且未被充分探索的方面。

Conclusion: 该工作为量化评估和改进视频生成模型的物理合理性提供了有效方法，解决了现有模型在物理推理方面的局限性。

Abstract: Despite impressive visual fidelity, modern video generative models frequently
produce sequences that violate intuitive physical laws, such as objects
floating, teleporting, or morphing in ways that defy causality. While humans
can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for
quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore
whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges
of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify
physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and
causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe
that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention
module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate
physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of
300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and
isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with
gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together,
TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving
physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and
underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.

### [8] [Label Semantics for Robust Hyperspectral Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07556)
*Rafin Hassan,Zarin Tasnim Roshni,Rafiqul Bari,Alimul Islam,Nabeel Mohammed,Moshiur Farazi,Shafin Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出S3FN网络，利用LLM生成的文本描述增强高光谱图像分类，通过语义-光谱-空间融合提升分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高光谱图像分类中训练样本有限、数据维度高导致的过拟合问题，以及传统单模态方法仅依赖光谱空间数据的局限性

Method: 使用LLM生成类别文本描述，通过BERT/RoBERTa编码为语义向量，与光谱空间特征融合进行多模态分类

Result: 在三个高光谱基准数据集上取得显著性能提升，验证了文本语义与光谱空间数据的协同效应

Conclusion: 语义增强的高光谱分类模型具有良好前景，为多模态融合方法开辟了新方向

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread
applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental
monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of
high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI
classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in
balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI
classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial
data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To
address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion
Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to
complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN
leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class
label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These
descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text
encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in
turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification
performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our
model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood,
HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance
boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and
spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically
augmented HSI classification models. Codes are be available in:

### [9] [Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07567)
*Karuna Bhaila,Aneesh Komanduri,Minh-Hao Van,Xintao Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CAGUL框架，一种轻量级的视觉语言模型遗忘方法，通过跨模态注意力引导来防止敏感信息泄露，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练过程中可能记忆并泄露私有敏感信息，现有遗忘方法主要针对文本模型，视觉上下文增加了复杂性。

Method: 利用跨模态注意力分析视觉token对输出的重要性，通过外部模块对低重要性视觉token进行编码转换来实现遗忘。

Result: 实验表明该方法性能优于或与微调基线相当，且不改变预训练模型参数，无需重新训练成本。

Conclusion: CAGUL为视觉语言模型提供了一种实用有效的遗忘解决方案，在防止信息泄露的同时保持了模型行为。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated immense capabilities in
multi-modal understanding and inference tasks such as Visual Question Answering
(VQA), which requires models to infer outputs based on visual and textual
context simultaneously. Such inference abilities of large-scale pretrained
models are often attributed to the massive scale of pre-training data collected
across several domains. However, the models may memorize private and/or
sensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.
Recently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of
private data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the
visual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition
to the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language
models, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for
output generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to
formulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and
efficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive
model finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning
information in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find
that the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain
reference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs
better or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the
pre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a
practical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.

### [10] [MaizeStandCounting (MaSC): Automated and Accurate Maize Stand Counting from UAV Imagery Using Image Processing and Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07580)
*Dewi Endah Kharismawati,Toni Kazic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MaSC算法，使用轻量级YOLOv9模型从无人机RGB图像自动计数玉米植株，在两种模式下均与人工计数高度一致，具有实时处理潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 玉米植株计数对作物管理和研究至关重要，但人工计数劳动密集、速度慢且易出错，特别是在大面积或变化大的田地中。

Method: 使用轻量级YOLOv9模型检测V2-V10生长期的玉米幼苗，区分玉米与杂草，基于检测结果的空间分布进行行和范围分割，提供精确的行级计数。

Result: 与2024年夏季苗圃的人工计数相比，马赛克图像模式R^2=0.616，原始视频帧模式R^2=0.906；处理83张全分辨率帧仅需60.63秒。

Conclusion: MaSC是一种可扩展、低成本且准确的自动化玉米植株计数工具，适用于研究和生产环境。

Abstract: Accurate maize stand counts are essential for crop management and research,
informing yield prediction, planting density optimization, and early detection
of germination issues. Manual counting is labor-intensive, slow, and
error-prone, especially across large or variable fields. We present
MaizeStandCounting (MaSC), a robust algorithm for automated maize seedling
stand counting from RGB imagery captured by low-cost UAVs and processed on
affordable hardware. MaSC operates in two modes: (1) mosaic images divided into
patches, and (2) raw video frames aligned using homography matrices. Both modes
use a lightweight YOLOv9 model trained to detect maize seedlings from V2-V10
growth stages. MaSC distinguishes maize from weeds and other vegetation, then
performs row and range segmentation based on the spatial distribution of
detections to produce precise row-wise stand counts. Evaluation against
in-field manual counts from our 2024 summer nursery showed strong agreement
with ground truth (R^2= 0.616 for mosaics, R^2 = 0.906 for raw frames). MaSC
processed 83 full-resolution frames in 60.63 s, including inference and
post-processing, highlighting its potential for real-time operation. These
results demonstrate MaSC's effectiveness as a scalable, low-cost, and accurate
tool for automated maize stand counting in both research and production
environments.

### [11] [Quick-CapsNet (QCN): A fast alternative to Capsule Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07600)
*Pouya Shiri,Ramin Sharifi,Amirali Baniasadi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Quick-CapsNet（QCN）作为CapsNet的快速替代方案，通过减少胶囊数量实现5倍推理速度提升，但准确率略有损失


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CapsNet虽然在某些任务上优于CNN，但训练和测试速度慢，限制了在需要快速网络的实时应用中的使用

Method: 通过减少胶囊数量来构建更快的网络，并使用更强大的解码器进一步改进QCN

Result: 在MNIST、F-MNIST、SVHN和Cifar-10数据集上推理速度提升5倍，准确率仅有轻微下降

Conclusion: QCN是开发快速实时CapsNet应用的可行起点，在保持良好性能的同时显著提升了速度

Abstract: The basic computational unit in Capsule Network (CapsNet) is a capsule (vs.
neurons in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)). A capsule is a set of
neurons, which form a vector. CapsNet is used for supervised classification of
data and has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy on MNIST digit recognition
dataset, outperforming conventional CNNs in detecting overlapping digits.
Moreover, CapsNet shows higher robustness towards affine transformation when
compared to CNNs for MNIST datasets. One of the drawbacks of CapsNet, however,
is slow training and testing. This can be a bottleneck for applications that
require a fast network, especially during inference. In this work, we introduce
Quick-CapsNet (QCN) as a fast alternative to CapsNet, which can be a starting
point to develop CapsNet for fast real-time applications. QCN builds on
producing a fewer number of capsules, which results in a faster network. QCN
achieves this at the cost of marginal loss in accuracy. Inference is 5x faster
on MNIST, F-MNIST, SVHN and Cifar-10 datasets. We also further enhanced QCN by
employing a more powerful decoder instead of the default decoder to further
improve QCN.

### [12] [Rectified-CFG++ for Flow Based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07631)
*Shreshth Saini,Shashank Gupta,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Rectified-CFG++方法，解决标准CFG在整流流模型中的离流形漂移问题，通过自适应预测-校正引导确保样本保持在数据流形附近，在多个大规模文生图模型中表现优于标准CFG。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分类器自由引导在整流流模型中会引起严重的离流形漂移，导致视觉伪影、文本不对齐和不稳定行为，需要一种几何感知的调节方法。

Method: 自适应预测-校正引导：首先执行条件整流流更新将样本锚定在学习到的传输路径附近，然后应用加权的条件校正，在条件和无条件速度场之间进行插值。

Result: 在Flux、Stable Diffusion 3/3.5、Lumina等大规模文生图模型上，在MS-COCO、LAION-Aesthetic、T2I-CompBench等基准数据集上一致优于标准CFG。

Conclusion: Rectified-CFG++将整流流的确定性效率与几何感知调节相结合，确保轨迹保持在数据流形的有界管状邻域内，在广泛的引导强度范围内保持稳定性。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the workhorse for steering large diffusion
models toward text-conditioned targets, yet its native application to rectified
flow (RF) based models provokes severe off-manifold drift, yielding visual
artifacts, text misalignment, and brittle behaviour. We present
Rectified-CFG++, an adaptive predictor-corrector guidance that couples the
deterministic efficiency of rectified flows with a geometry-aware conditioning
rule. Each inference step first executes a conditional RF update that anchors
the sample near the learned transport path, then applies a weighted conditional
correction that interpolates between conditional and unconditional velocity
fields. We prove that the resulting velocity field is marginally consistent and
that its trajectories remain within a bounded tubular neighbourhood of the data
manifold, ensuring stability across a wide range of guidance strengths.
Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image models (Flux, Stable
Diffusion 3/3.5, Lumina) show that Rectified-CFG++ consistently outperforms
standard CFG on benchmark datasets such as MS-COCO, LAION-Aesthetic, and
T2I-CompBench. Project page: https://rectified-cfgpp.github.io/

*Shashank Gupta,Gregoire Phillips,Alan C. Bovik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PIT-QMM，一种能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云的新型大型多模态模型，用于无参考点云质量评估，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在图像和视频质量评估方面取得了显著进展，但在3D资产领域的应用尚未充分探索。不同模态数据（文本描述、2D投影和3D点云视图）能够提供关于点云质量的互补信息。

Method: 构建PIT-QMM模型，能够端到端处理文本、图像和点云数据来预测质量分数。利用多模态信息的互补性进行无参考点云质量评估。

Result: 在流行基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，且训练迭代次数更少。框架还支持失真定位和识别，为模型可解释性和交互性开辟了新途径。

Conclusion: PIT-QMM在无参考点云质量评估方面表现出色，不仅提升了性能，还增强了模型的可解释性和交互能力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently enabled considerable advances in
the realm of image and video quality assessment, but this progress has yet to
be fully explored in the domain of 3D assets. We are interested in using these
models to conduct No-Reference Point Cloud Quality Assessment (NR-PCQA), where
the aim is to automatically evaluate the perceptual quality of a point cloud in
absence of a reference. We begin with the observation that different modalities
of data - text descriptions, 2D projections, and 3D point cloud views - provide
complementary information about point cloud quality. We then construct PIT-QMM,
a novel LMM for NR-PCQA that is capable of consuming text, images and point
clouds end-to-end to predict quality scores. Extensive experimentation shows
that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art by significant
margins on popular benchmarks with fewer training iterations. We also
demonstrate that our framework enables distortion localization and
identification, which paves a new way forward for model explainability and
interactivity. Code and datasets are available at

### [14] [Dual-Stream Alignment for Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07652)
*Harshala Gammulle,Clinton Fookes,Sridha Sridharan,Simon Denman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了双流对齐网络（DSA Net），通过结合量子-经典混合机器学习框架来改进动作分割性能，在两个流之间进行特征对齐，并在多个基准数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作分割方法主要关注单流方法，而最近研究转向双流方法学习动作特征。本文旨在探索引入第二流动作特征来指导分割，捕捉动作和动作转换线索。

Method: 使用双流对齐网络，包含帧级流和动作级流，通过时间上下文块进行信息融合，采用交叉注意力和量子动作引导调制。通过双流对齐损失（关系一致性、跨层对比和循环一致性重建损失）促进特征对齐。

Result: 在GTEA、Breakfast、50Salads和EgoProcel等多个基准数据集上评估，DSA Net实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。通过消融研究验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个将量子-经典混合机器学习框架引入动作分割的研究，提出的双流对齐网络通过特征对齐和量子调制有效提升了动作分割性能。

Abstract: Action segmentation is a challenging yet active research area that involves
identifying when and where specific actions occur in continuous video streams.
Most existing work has focused on single-stream approaches that model the
spatio-temporal aspects of frame sequences. However, recent research has
shifted toward two-stream methods that learn action-wise features to enhance
action segmentation performance. In this work, we propose the Dual-Stream
Alignment Network (DSA Net) and investigate the impact of incorporating a
second stream of learned action features to guide segmentation by capturing
both action and action-transition cues. Communication between the two streams
is facilitated by a Temporal Context (TC) block, which fuses complementary
information using cross-attention and Quantum-based Action-Guided Modulation
(Q-ActGM), enhancing the expressive power of the fused features. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first study to introduce a hybrid quantum-classical
machine learning framework for action segmentation. Our primary objective is
for the two streams (frame-wise and action-wise) to learn a shared feature
space through feature alignment. This is encouraged by the proposed Dual-Stream
Alignment Loss, which comprises three components: relational consistency,
cross-level contrastive, and cycle-consistency reconstruction losses. Following
prior work, we evaluate DSA Net on several diverse benchmark datasets: GTEA,
Breakfast, 50Salads, and EgoProcel. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of
each component through extensive ablation studies. Notably, DSA Net achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing

TL;DR: 提出OIE方法，通过首帧服装替换策略实现视频虚拟试穿，避免传统双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer中的参数和计算开销问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的双分支架构在Diffusion Transformer中难以适配，引入服装参考分支需要修改主干网络导致参数过多，且服装潜在特征缺乏时序特性需要额外学习

Method: 使用图像服装替换模型处理首帧，然后在编辑后的首帧内容控制下，利用姿态和掩码信息引导视频生成模型的时序先验，顺序合成剩余帧

Result: 实验表明该方法在参数效率和计算效率方面表现优异，同时在约束条件下仍保持领先性能

Conclusion: OIE方法通过首帧服装替换策略有效解决了视频虚拟试穿中的参数和计算效率问题，实现了高效且性能优越的解决方案

Abstract: Video virtual try-on aims to replace the clothing of a person in a video with
a target garment. Current dual-branch architectures have achieved significant
success in diffusion models based on the U-Net; however, adapting them to
diffusion models built upon the Diffusion Transformer remains challenging.
Initially, introducing latent space features from the garment reference branch
requires adding or modifying the backbone network, leading to a large number of
trainable parameters. Subsequently, the latent space features of garments lack
inherent temporal characteristics and thus require additional learning. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach, OIE (Once is Enough), a
virtual try-on strategy based on first-frame clothing replacement:
specifically, we employ an image-based clothing transfer model to replace the
clothing in the initial frame, and then, under the content control of the
edited first frame, utilize pose and mask information to guide the temporal
prior of the video generation model in synthesizing the remaining frames
sequentially. Experiments show that our method achieves superior parameter
efficiency and computational efficiency while still maintaining leading
performance under these constraints.

*James Baker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于IP-Adapter的个性化扩散模型改进方法，通过自动生成的掩码限制图像标记只关注主体，让文本提示更好地控制背景生成，从而提高文本提示与源图像的匹配度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化扩散模型在生成图像时往往过度关注主体而忽略文本提示，导致生成的图像只是简单重现主体而无法准确响应文本描述。

Method: 利用IP-Adapter自动生成的掩码，在推理过程中对图像标记进行二次处理，将图像标记限制在主体区域，使文本提示能够更好地控制背景内容的生成。

Result: 对于描述地点和位置的文本提示，该方法能够生成准确描绘主体同时完全匹配提示的图像，相比其他个性化方法显示出更高的提示和源图像对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过自动掩码机制限制图像标记的注意力范围，可以有效提升个性化扩散模型中文本提示的控制能力，实现更好的主体与背景协调生成。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models allows users to generate new images that
incorporate a given subject, allowing more control than a text prompt. These
models often suffer somewhat when they end up just recreating the subject
image, and ignoring the text prompt. We observe that one popular method for
personalization, the IP-Adapter automatically generates masks that we
definitively segment the subject from the background during inference. We
propose to use this automatically generated mask on a second pass to mask the
image tokens, thus restricting them to the subject, not the background,
allowing the text prompt to attend to the rest of the image. For text prompts
describing locations and places, this produces images that accurately depict
the subject while definitively matching the prompt. We compare our method to a
few other test time personalization methods, and find our method displays high
prompt and source image alignment.

TL;DR: 提出TCIP模型，通过特征增强残差模块(FERM)解决金字塔网络中解剖结构错位累积问题，采用双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略自适应确定迭代次数，在多个医学影像数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金字塔网络在可变形医学图像配准中性能优越，但其解码器架构容易传播和累积解剖结构错位，且现有模型无法自适应确定不同图像所需的优化迭代次数，导致配准精度下降。

Method: 提出特征增强残差模块(FERM)作为金字塔网络解码层的核心组件，包含三个顺序块：提取解剖语义特征、抑制无关特征、估计最终形变场；提出双阶段阈值控制迭代(TCI)策略，第一阶段评估配准稳定性，第二阶段评估收敛性。

Result: 在三个公共脑部MRI数据集和一个腹部CT数据集上的实验表明，TCIP在准确性方面优于最先进的配准网络，同时保持相当的推理速度和紧凑的模型参数大小。

Conclusion: TCIP模型通过FERM和TCI有效解决了解剖错位累积和迭代次数自适应问题，在多个医学影像数据集上表现出优越性能，且具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Although pyramid networks have demonstrated superior performance in
deformable medical image registration, their decoder architectures are
inherently prone to propagating and accumulating anatomical structure
misalignments. Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the
number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements
across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive
iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the
accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced
Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the
pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical
semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the
final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of
iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled
Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration
stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to
evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as
Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three
public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP
outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of
accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model
parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by
integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct
ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常针对固定输入格式训练，无法满足需要混合粒度控制（从精确对象轨迹到粗略文本提示）的视频工作流程需求。

Method: 将任务建模为变分推断，利用多个视频生成主干网络共同处理所有任务约束，通过逐步KL散度最小化和上下文条件分解技术解决优化问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在可控性、多样性和3D一致性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够为指定元素提供高可控性，同时为未指定元素保持多样性，解决了视频合成中混合粒度控制的需求。

Abstract: Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency
compared to prior works.

Abstract: Induction motors (IMs) are indispensable in industrial and daily life, but
they are susceptible to various faults that can lead to overheating, wasted
energy consumption, and service failure. Early detection of faults is essential
to protect the motor and prolong its lifespan. This paper presents a hybrid
method that integrates BYOL with CNNs for classifying thermal images of
induction motors for fault detection. The thermal dataset used in this work
includes different operating states of the motor, such as normal operation,
overload, and faults. We employed multiple deep learning (DL) models for the
BYOL technique, ranging from popular architectures such as ResNet-50,
DenseNet-121, DenseNet-169, EfficientNetB0, VGG16, and MobileNetV2.
Additionally, we introduced a new high-performance yet lightweight CNN model

highlights the promising performance of the CNN-BYOL hybrid method in enhancing
accuracy for detecting faults in induction motors, offering a robust

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于中心的方法在捕捉全局数据分布方面表现出色，但往往未能充分利用重要的局部相似性信息，而基于配对的方法在这方面更有效。

Method: 采用双分支结构：强中心分支和弱配对分支，通过迭代式相互学习过程，中心分支从配对分支学习局部相似性线索，并引入混合哈希专家模块实现跨分支交互。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MLH始终优于最先进的哈希方法。

Conclusion: MLH框架通过结合中心方法和配对方法的优势，有效提升了深度哈希的性能，证明了弱到强知识转移在哈希学习中的有效性。

Abstract: Deep hashing has been widely adopted for large-scale image retrieval, with
numerous strategies proposed to optimize hash function learning. Pairwise-based
methods are effective in learning hash functions that preserve local similarity
relationships, whereas center-based methods typically achieve superior
performance by more effectively capturing global data distributions. However,
the strength of center-based methods in modeling global structures often comes
at the expense of underutilizing important local similarity information. To
address this limitation, we propose Mutual Learning for Hashing (MLH), a novel
weak-to-strong framework that enhances a center-based hashing branch by
transferring knowledge from a weaker pairwise-based branch. MLH consists of two
branches: a strong center-based branch and a weaker pairwise-based branch.
Through an iterative mutual learning process, the center-based branch leverages
local similarity cues learned by the pairwise-based branch. Furthermore,
inspired by the mixture-of-experts paradigm, we introduce a novel
mixture-of-hash-experts module that enables effective cross-branch interaction,
further enhancing the performance of both branches. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MLH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art hashing methods
across multiple benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: Repainter框架在电商图像修复任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法在商业应用中的局限性，为电商平台提供了有效的图像优化解决方案。

Abstract: In web data, product images are central to boosting user engagement and
advertising efficacy on e-commerce platforms, yet the intrusive elements such
as watermarks and promotional text remain major obstacles to delivering clear
and appealing product visuals. Although diffusion-based inpainting methods have
advanced, they still face challenges in commercial settings due to unreliable
object removal and limited domain-specific adaptation. To tackle these
challenges, we propose Repainter, a reinforcement learning framework that
integrates spatial-matting trajectory refinement with Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Our approach modulates attention mechanisms to emphasize
background context, generating higher-reward samples and reducing unwanted
object insertion. We also introduce a composite reward mechanism that balances
global, local, and semantic constraints, effectively reducing visual artifacts
and reward hacking. Additionally, we contribute EcomPaint-100K, a high-quality,
large-scale e-commerce inpainting dataset, and a standardized benchmark
EcomPaint-Bench for fair evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Repainter significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
challenging scenes with intricate compositions. We will release our code and
weights upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了未来3D生成模型的有前景方向，通过整合2D和3D生成模型的互补优势实现高质量重建。

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D full-body human reconstruction from a single image is a
critical yet challenging task for applications in films and video games due to
inherent ambiguities and severe self-occlusions. While recent approaches
leverage SMPL estimation and SMPL-conditioned image generative models to
hallucinate novel views, they suffer from inaccurate 3D priors estimated from
SMPL meshes and have difficulty in handling difficult human poses and
reconstructing fine details. In this paper, we propose SyncHuman, a novel
framework that combines 2D multiview generative model and 3D native generative
model for the first time, enabling high-quality clothed human mesh
reconstruction from single-view images even under challenging human poses.
Multiview generative model excels at capturing fine 2D details but struggles
with structural consistency, whereas 3D native generative model generates
coarse yet structurally consistent 3D shapes. By integrating the complementary
strengths of these two approaches, we develop a more effective generation
framework. Specifically, we first jointly fine-tune the multiview generative
model and the 3D native generative model with proposed pixel-aligned 2D-3D
synchronization attention to produce geometrically aligned 3D shapes and 2D
multiview images. To further improve details, we introduce a feature injection
mechanism that lifts fine details from 2D multiview images onto the aligned 3D
shapes, enabling accurate and high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SyncHuman achieves robust and photo-realistic 3D
human reconstruction, even for images with challenging poses. Our method
outperforms baseline methods in geometric accuracy and visual fidelity,
demonstrating a promising direction for future 3D generation models.

Motivation: 高斯溅射(GS)虽然能实现沉浸式渲染，但3D物体与场景的组合仍面临挑战。GS辐射场中烘焙的外观和阴影信息导致物体与场景组合时出现不一致性，这需要可重光照的物体重建和场景光照估计。

Conclusion: ComGS框架成功解决了高斯溅射中3D物体-场景组合的挑战，通过高效的SOPs和光照估计方法，实现了实时、高质量的渲染效果。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) enables immersive rendering, but realistic 3D
object-scene composition remains challenging. Baked appearance and shadow
information in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects
and scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and
scene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing
Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to
low efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store
lighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via
interpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x
speedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian
scenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering
methods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex
scenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and
are viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily
concerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the
challenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the
environment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360
degrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune
a diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we
propose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method
achieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually
harmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for
editing. Code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高动态范围场景中亮暗区域曝光差异大的问题，传统RGB包围曝光方法容易产生重影和对齐问题，而RAW图像凭借更高位深和可预测噪声特性具有更大潜力。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：首先通过比率图进行曝光校正以平衡动态范围，然后使用亮度感知RAW去噪器增强暗区细节恢复；构建9档包围曝光流程合成真实UHDR图像数据集。

Result: 实验表明UltraLED显著优于现有单帧方法，能够有效恢复暗区细节同时保留高光信息。

Conclusion: 仅使用单帧短曝光RAW图像即可实现高质量的UHDR重建，避免了多帧方法的重影问题，在动态场景中表现鲁棒。

Abstract: Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure
disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly
encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure
settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,
making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details
simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends
using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and
ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains
sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in
denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB
images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise
characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This
raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only
a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single
short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making
it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce
UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio
map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to
enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a
9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a
corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure
as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED
significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and
dataset are made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯溅射具有挑战性，因为大帧间运动会增加解空间的不确定性。事件相机能异步捕捉快速视觉变化且抗运动模糊，但缺乏颜色信息。结合两种模态可以互补优势。

Method: 采用事件运动先验指导变形场优化：1) 使用LoCM无监督微调框架从事件流提取运动先验；2) 提出几何感知数据关联方法建立事件-高斯运动对应关系；3) 使用运动分解和帧间伪标签策略。

Result: 在合成和真实场景上的大量实验表明，该方法优于现有的基于图像和事件的方法，证明事件数据能有效优化动态3D高斯溅射。

Conclusion: 通过结合事件流提供的确定性约束，成功解决了低帧率RGB视频重建动态3D高斯溅射时的大帧间运动不确定性挑战，实现了更优的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing Dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from low-framerate RGB
videos is challenging. This is because large inter-frame motions will increase
the uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first
frame might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second
frame. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are
robust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,
the event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame
large motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining
low-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address
this challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS
using both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between
these two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly
optimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event
motion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we
extract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM
unsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a
certain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association
method to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary
foundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion
decomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label. Extensive experiments show that our
method outperforms existing image and event-based approaches across synthetic
and real scenes and prove that our method can effectively optimize dynamic 3DGS
with the help of event data.

Abstract: The current study investigated the use of Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) to improve the accuracy of brain tumor segmentation in MRI images, with
the goal of assisting physicians in clinical decision-making. The study focused
on applying UNet models for brain tumor segmentation and using the XAI
techniques of Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and
attention-based visualization to enhance the understanding of these models.
Three deep learning models - UNet, Residual UNet (ResUNet), and Attention UNet
(AttUNet) - were evaluated to identify the best-performing model. XAI was
employed with the aims of clarifying model decisions and increasing physicians'
trust in these models. We compared the performance of two UNet variants
(ResUNet and AttUNet) with the conventional UNet in segmenting brain tumors
from the BraTS2020 public dataset and analyzed model predictions with Grad-CAM
and attention-based visualization. Using the latest computer hardware, we
trained and validated each model using the Adam optimizer and assessed their
performance with respect to: (i) training, validation, and inference times,
(ii) segmentation similarity coefficients and loss functions, and (iii)
classification performance. Notably, during the final testing phase, ResUNet
outperformed the other models with respect to Dice and Jaccard similarity
scores, as well as accuracy, recall, and F1 scores. Grad-CAM provided
visuospatial insights into the tumor subregions each UNet model focused on
while attention-based visualization provided valuable insights into the working
mechanisms of AttUNet's attention modules. These results demonstrated ResUNet
as the best-performing model and we conclude by recommending its use for
automated brain tumor segmentation in future clinical assessments. Our source

### [28] [GTR-Bench: Evaluating Geo-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07791)
*Qinghongbing Xie,Zhaoyuan Xia,Feng Zhu,Lijun Gong,Ziyue Li,Rui Zhao,Long Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Geo-Temporal Reasoning benchmark (GTR-Bench)，这是一个用于评估视觉语言模型在地理时空推理能力的新基准，特别关注大规模摄像头网络中移动目标的地理时空推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的时空基准主要关注以自我为中心的图像/视频推理或基于图形的地理推理，无法评估VLMs在同时使用图像/视频和图形上下文时的地理时空智能，这对于交通管理和应急响应等领域很重要。

Method: 构建了GTR-Bench基准，要求模型在地图和视频之间进行多视角切换，跨多个非重叠视野的视频进行联合推理，并对视频未观察到的时空区域进行推断。

Result: 评估了10多个流行VLM，发现即使最佳专有模型Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%)也显著落后于人类表现(78.61%)。分析揭示了当前模型的三个主要缺陷：时空上下文利用不平衡、时间预测能力弱、地图与多视角视频输入理解对齐能力不足。

Conclusion: GTR-Bench为时空智能研究提供了有价值的见解和新的机会，揭示了当前VLMs在地理时空推理方面的重大局限性。

Abstract: Recently spatial-temporal intelligence of Visual-Language Models (VLMs) has
attracted much attention due to its importance for Autonomous Driving, Embodied
AI and General Artificial Intelligence. Existing spatial-temporal benchmarks
mainly focus on egocentric perspective reasoning with images/video context, or
geographic perspective reasoning with graphics context (eg. a map), thus fail
to assess VLMs' geographic spatial-temporal intelligence with both images/video
and graphics context, which is important for areas like traffic management and
emergency response. To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning
benchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of
moving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging
as it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint
reasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and
inference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video
context. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that
even the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags
behind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our
comprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of
current models for geo-temporal reasoning. (1) VLMs' reasoning is impaired by
an imbalanced utilization of spatial-temporal context. (2) VLMs are weak in
temporal forecasting, which leads to worse performance on temporal-emphasized
tasks than on spatial-emphasized tasks. (3) VLMs lack the proficiency to
comprehend or align the map data with multi-view video inputs. We believe
GTR-Bench offers valuable insights and opens up new opportunities for research
and applications in spatial-temporal intelligence. Benchmark and code will be
released at https://github.com/X-Luffy/GTR-Bench.

Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法通常只计算起始到顶点帧的光流，忽略了顶点到结束阶段的运动信息，限制了识别性能。

Method: 提出MM-COF综合运动表示，整合两个微表情阶段的运动动态；设计FMANet端到端网络架构，将双阶段分析和幅度调制内化为可学习模块。

Result: 在MMEW、SMIC、CASME-II和SAMM四个标准数据集上的实验表明，所提方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 可学习的双阶段框架在推进微表情识别方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions, characterized by their subtle and brief nature, are
valuable indicators of genuine emotions. Despite their significance in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition
remains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.
Optical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to
its effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only
between the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion
information in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first
introduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated
Combined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both
micro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in
recognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a
novel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase
analysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules. This allows the
network to adaptively fuse motion cues and focus on salient facial regions for
classification. Experimental evaluations on the MMEW, SMIC, CASME-II, and SAMM
datasets, widely recognized as standard benchmarks, demonstrate that our
proposed MM-COF representation and FMANet outperforms existing methods,
underscoring the potential of a learnable, dual-phase framework in advancing
micro-expression recognition.

Abstract: Predicting spherical pixel depth from monocular $360^{\circ}$ indoor
panoramas is critical for many vision applications. However, existing methods
focus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise
sensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on
room geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through
layout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation
process through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our
framework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders
for layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The
shared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed
by individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room
layout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework
incorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving
strategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed
room-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room
layout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background
depth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives
fusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation
decoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,
Matterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can
achieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ACAVP是一种增强型视觉提示方法，通过引入仿射变换和颜色变换来解决传统视觉提示方法的表达力不足和过拟合问题，同时使用TrivialAugment数据增强显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉提示方法存在表达力受限（仅使用简单加法变换）和参数增加时容易过拟合的问题，导致准确率低于其他适应方法。

Method: 提出ACAVP方法，包含三种变换操作：仿射变换（创建任务特定提示区域并保留原始图像信息）、颜色变换（强调任务相关视觉特征）和加法变换。同时引入TrivialAugment数据增强来解决过拟合问题。

Result: 在12个不同图像分类数据集和两种模型架构上的实验表明，ACAVP在视觉提示方法中达到最先进准确率，平均准确率超过线性探测，对分布偏移具有更强鲁棒性，且推理时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: ACAVP通过增强变换操作和数据增强有效解决了视觉提示方法的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能，证明了适当的数据增强对视觉提示训练具有普遍益处。

Abstract: Visual prompting (VP) has emerged as a promising parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approach for adapting pre-trained vision models to downstream tasks
without modifying model parameters. Despite offering advantages like negligible
computational overhead and compatibility with black-box models, conventional VP
methods typically achieve lower accuracy than other adaptation approaches. Our
analysis reveals two critical limitations: the restricted expressivity of
simple additive transformation and a tendency toward overfitting when the
parameter count increases. To address these challenges, we propose ACAVP
(Affine, Color, and Additive Visual Prompting), which enhances VP's expressive
power by introducing complementary transformation operations: affine
transformation for creating task-specific prompt regions while preserving
original image information, and color transformation for emphasizing
task-relevant visual features. Additionally, we identify that overfitting is a
critical issue in VP training and introduce TrivialAugment as an effective data
augmentation, which not only benefits our approach but also significantly
improves existing VP methods, with performance gains of up to 12 percentage
points on certain datasets. This demonstrates that appropriate data
augmentation is universally beneficial for VP training. Extensive experiments
across twelve diverse image classification datasets with two different model
architectures demonstrate that ACAVP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy among
VP methods, surpasses linear probing in average accuracy, and exhibits superior
robustness to distribution shifts, all while maintaining minimal computational
overhead during inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中经常出现多人与多物体的复杂交互，但现有3D人-物交互基准只考虑了其中一小部分，需要更全面的数据集和方法。

Method: 提出了MMHOI-Net，一个基于transformer的端到端神经网络，使用结构化双补丁表示来建模物体及其交互，并结合动作识别来增强交互预测。

Result: 在MMHOI和CORE4D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在多HOI建模方面达到了最先进性能，在准确性和重建质量方面表现出色。

Conclusion: MMHOI数据集和MMHOI-Net模型为下一代HOI研究提供了全面的测试平台，能够有效处理复杂的多人与多物体交互场景。

Abstract: Real-world scenes often feature multiple humans interacting with multiple
objects in ways that are causal, goal-oriented, or cooperative. Yet existing 3D
human-object interaction (HOI) benchmarks consider only a fraction of these
complex interactions. To close this gap, we present MMHOI -- a large-scale,
Multi-human Multi-object Interaction dataset consisting of images from 12
everyday scenarios. MMHOI offers complete 3D shape and pose annotations for
every person and object, along with labels for 78 action categories and 14
interaction-specific body parts, providing a comprehensive testbed for
next-generation HOI research. Building on MMHOI, we present MMHOI-Net, an
end-to-end transformer-based neural network for jointly estimating human-object
3D geometries, their interactions, and associated actions. A key innovation in
our framework is a structured dual-patch representation for modeling objects
and their interactions, combined with action recognition to enhance the
interaction prediction. Experiments on MMHOI and the recently proposed CORE4D
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in
multi-HOI modeling, excelling in both accuracy and reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: PrismGS是一个基于物理正则化的框架，通过金字塔多尺度监督和显式尺寸正则化，解决了3D高斯溅射在大规模城市场景中的走样问题和优化不稳定性，显著提升了渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射在大型城市场景中面临严重的走样伪影和优化不稳定性，特别是在高分辨率渲染时会出现闪烁纹理和锯齿边缘。现有方法虽然解决了可扩展性问题，但未能解决这种保真度差距。

Method: 提出两种协同正则化器：金字塔多尺度监督，通过监督渲染与预过滤图像金字塔的一致性，强制模型学习抗走样的表示；显式尺寸正则化，对3D高斯的尺寸施加物理基础的下界约束，防止形成退化的视图相关基元。

Result: 在MatrixCity、Mill-19和UrbanScene3D数据集上的实验表明，PrismGS实现了最先进的性能，相比CityGaussian获得了约1.5 dB的PSNR增益，并在4K渲染下保持了卓越的质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PrismGS是一个即插即用的框架，与现有管道兼容，通过物理基础的正则化显著提升了3D高斯溅射在大规模城市场景中的渲染质量和稳定性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time photorealistic
rendering in compact scenes, but scaling to large urban environments introduces
severe aliasing artifacts and optimization instability, especially under
high-resolution (e.g., 4K) rendering. These artifacts, manifesting as
flickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian
primitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing
``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this
fidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded
regularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D
Gaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is
pyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising
the rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to
learn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across
different viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is
complemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a
physically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians. This
prevents the formation of degenerate, view-dependent primitives, leading to
more stable and plausible geometric surfaces and reducing jagged edges. Our
method is plug-and-play and compatible with existing pipelines. Extensive
experiments on MatrixCity, Mill-19, and UrbanScene3D demonstrate that PrismGS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding significant PSNR gains around
1.5 dB against CityGaussian, while maintaining its superior quality and
robustness under demanding 4K rendering.

Conclusion: 提出的端到端框架能够有效实现手语视频到语音的直接翻译，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sign language to spoken language audio translation is important to connect
the hearing- and speech-challenged humans with others. We consider sign
language videos with isolated sign sequences rather than continuous grammatical
signing. Such videos are useful in educational applications and sign prompt
interfaces. Towards this, we propose IsoSignVid2Aud, a novel end-to-end
framework that translates sign language videos with a sequence of possibly
non-grammatic continuous signs to speech without requiring intermediate text
representation, providing immediate communication benefits while avoiding the
latency and cascading errors inherent in multi-stage translation systems. Our
approach combines an I3D-based feature extraction module with a specialized
feature transformation network and an audio generation pipeline, utilizing a
novel Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS) algorithm for the temporal detection of
signs in non-grammatic continuous sequences. Experimental results demonstrate
competitive performance on ASL-Citizen-1500 and WLASL-100 datasets with Top-1
accuracies of 72.01\% and 78.67\%, respectively, and audio quality metrics
(PESQ: 2.67, STOI: 0.73) indicating intelligible speech output. Code is

Result: 在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的新视角合成结果，并产生具有优越几何精度的重建效果。

Conclusion: 利用语义先验作为几何正则化器可以从有限的输入视图中产生更连贯和完整的3D模型。

Abstract: The demand for semantically rich 3D models of indoor scenes is rapidly
growing, driven by applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and
robotics. However, creating them from sparse views remains a challenge due to
geometric ambiguity. Existing methods often treat semantics as a passive
feature painted on an already-formed, and potentially flawed, geometry. We
posit that for robust sparse-view reconstruction, semantic understanding
instead be an active, guiding force. This paper introduces AlignGS, a novel
framework that actualizes this vision by pioneering a synergistic, end-to-end
optimization of geometry and semantics. Our method distills rich priors from 2D
foundation models and uses them to directly regularize the 3D representation
through a set of novel semantic-to-geometry guidance mechanisms, including
depth consistency and multi-faceted normal regularization. Extensive
evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions
with superior geometric accuracy. The results validate that leveraging semantic
priors as a geometric regularizer leads to more coherent and complete 3D models
from limited input views. Our code is avaliable at

Abstract: High-throughput toxicity testing offers a fast and cost-effective way to test

chemical compounds targeting different processes in early embryonic
development. Our analysis shows that the learned representations using
self-supervised learning are suitable for effectively distinguishing between
the modes-of-action of different compounds. Finally, we discuss the integration

Motivation: 现有的正向重建范式在重建驾驶场景时存在两个主要问题：(1)固定视角变换在相机配置改变时失效，限制了跨不同驾驶场景的泛化能力；(2)稀疏视图间重叠区域小且驾驶场景复杂，增加了学习难度，降低了重建精度。

Method: 提出统一圆柱体相机建模(UCCM)策略避免学习视角依赖的空间对应关系，使用可调参数统一不同相机配置；基于新设计的圆柱平面特征组(CPFG)提出混合表示和专用模块，将2D图像特征提升到3D空间。

Conclusion: XYZCylinder通过统一的圆柱体提升方法有效解决了驾驶场景重建中的泛化能力和精度问题，在多种评估场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Recently, more attention has been paid to feedforward reconstruction
paradigms, which mainly learn a fixed view transformation implicitly and
reconstruct the scene with a single representation. However, their
generalization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while
reconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed
view transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the
generalization capability across different driving scenes equipped with
different camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between
sparse views of the $360^\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes
increase the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To
handle these difficulties, we propose \textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model
based on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and
feature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we
design a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the
learning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different
camera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction
accuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules
based on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image
features to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves
state-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be
generalized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型从图像扩展到视频时面临高计算成本问题，现有token压缩方法会导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 采用检索-压缩策略：使用视觉记忆检索器选择关键片段，通过压缩组相对策略优化框架将教师模型的推理能力蒸馏到学生模型。

Conclusion: MARC展示了在资源受限环境中实现高效实时视频理解的潜力，适用于视频问答、监控和自动驾驶等场景。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large language models (LLMs) has laid the foundation
for multimodal models. However, visual language models (VLMs) still face heavy
computational costs when extended from images to videos due to high frame rates
and long durations. Token compression is a promising solution, yet most
existing training-free methods cause information loss and performance
degradation. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{Memory-Augmented
Reinforcement Learning-based Token Compression (MARC)}, which integrates
structured retrieval and RL-based distillation. MARC adopts a
\textit{retrieve-then-compress} strategy using a \textbf{Visual Memory
Retriever (VMR)} to select key clips and a \textbf{Compression Group Relative
Policy Optimization (C-GRPO)} framework to distil reasoning ability from a
teacher to a student model. Experiments on six video benchmarks show that MARC
achieves near-baseline accuracy using only one frame's tokens -- reducing
visual tokens by \textbf{95\%}, GPU memory by \textbf{72\%}, and latency by
\textbf{23.9\%}. This demonstrates its potential for efficient, real-time video
understanding in resource-constrained settings such as video QA, surveillance,
and autonomous driving.

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a pivotal role in manufacturing quality control, yet
its application is constrained by limited abnormal samples and high manual
annotation costs. While anomaly synthesis offers a promising solution, existing
studies predominantly treat anomaly synthesis as an auxiliary component within
anomaly detection frameworks, lacking systematic evaluation of anomaly
synthesis algorithms. Current research also overlook crucial factors specific
to anomaly synthesis, such as decoupling its impact from detection,
quantitative analysis of synthetic data and adaptability across different
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose ASBench, the first
comprehensive benchmarking framework dedicated to evaluating anomaly synthesis
methods. Our framework introduces four critical evaluation dimensions: (i) the
generalization performance across different datasets and pipelines (ii) the
ratio of synthetic to real data (iii) the correlation between intrinsic metrics
of synthesis images and anomaly detection performance metrics , and (iv)
strategies for hybrid anomaly synthesis methods. Through extensive experiments,
ASBench not only reveals limitations in current anomaly synthesis methods but
also provides actionable insights for future research directions in anomaly
synthesis

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TTOM是一个无需训练的框架，通过在推理时优化新参数并与时空布局对齐，提升视频基础模型在组合场景下的文本-图像对齐能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频基础模型在组合场景（如运动、数字和空间关系）中表现不佳，需要改进文本-图像对齐能力。

Method: 提出测试时优化和记忆化框架，集成并优化新参数，使用通用布局-注意力目标，并采用参数化记忆机制维护历史优化上下文。

Result: 在T2V-CompBench和Vbench基准测试中，TTOM被证明是有效、实用、可扩展且高效的框架，能够实现组合视频生成的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: TTOM能够解耦组合性世界知识，展现出强大的可转移性和泛化能力，为组合视频生成提供实时跨模态对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Video Foundation Models (VFMs) exhibit remarkable visual generation
performance, but struggle in compositional scenarios (e.g., motion, numeracy,
and spatial relation). In this work, we introduce Test-Time Optimization and
Memorization (TTOM), a training-free framework that aligns VFM outputs with
spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming
setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory
mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and
delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge,
showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on
the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective,
practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment
for compositional video generation on the fly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CVD-STORM是一个跨视角视频扩散模型，通过空间-时间重建VAE生成多视角长视频，具备4D重建能力，在自动驾驶场景中显著提升生成质量和几何信息重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶发展，需要不仅能生成高保真控制视频，还能产生深度估计等多样化有意义信息的模型。

Method: 首先通过辅助4D重建任务微调VAE，增强其3D结构和时间动态编码能力，然后将该VAE集成到视频扩散过程中提升生成质量，同时联合训练高斯泼溅解码器重建动态场景。

Result: 实验结果显示模型在FID和FVD指标上取得显著提升，高斯泼溅解码器能有效重建动态场景并提供几何信息。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了高质量多视角视频生成与4D场景重建的结合，为全面场景理解提供了有价值的几何信息。

Abstract: Generative models have been widely applied to world modeling for environment
simulation and future state prediction. With advancements in autonomous
driving, there is a growing demand not only for high-fidelity video generation
under various controls, but also for producing diverse and meaningful
information such as depth estimation. To address this, we propose CVD-STORM, a
cross-view video diffusion model utilizing a spatial-temporal reconstruction
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that generates long-term, multi-view videos with
4D reconstruction capabilities under various control inputs. Our approach first
fine-tunes the VAE with an auxiliary 4D reconstruction task, enhancing its
ability to encode 3D structures and temporal dynamics. Subsequently, we
integrate this VAE into the video diffusion process to significantly improve
generation quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
substantial improvements in both FID and FVD metrics. Additionally, the
jointly-trained Gaussian Splatting Decoder effectively reconstructs dynamic
scenes, providing valuable geometric information for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Motivation: 现有文本检测数据集主要针对自然或文档场景，而动漫场景中的文本具有风格多样、排列不规则、易与复杂视觉元素混淆等特点，现有数据集无法有效处理这些特性。

Method: 构建大规模动漫文本数据集AnimeText，包含分层标注和针对动漫场景的困难负样本，通过跨数据集基准测试评估其有效性。

Abstract: Current text detection datasets primarily target natural or document scenes,
where text typically appear in regular font and shapes, monotonous colors, and
orderly layouts. The text usually arranged along straight or curved lines.
However, these characteristics differ significantly from anime scenes, where
text is often diverse in style, irregularly arranged, and easily confused with
complex visual elements such as symbols and decorative patterns. Text in anime
scene also includes a large number of handwritten and stylized fonts. Motivated
by this gap, we introduce AnimeText, a large-scale dataset containing 735K
images and 4.2M annotated text blocks. It features hierarchical annotations and
hard negative samples tailored for anime scenarios. %Cross-dataset evaluations
using state-of-the-art methods demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
achieve superior performance in anime text detection tasks compared to existing
datasets. To evaluate the robustness of AnimeText in complex anime scenes, we
conducted cross-dataset benchmarking using state-of-the-art text detection
methods. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on AnimeText
outperform those trained on existing datasets in anime scene text detection
tasks. AnimeText on HuggingFace:

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting predicts future radar sequences based on current
observations, which is a highly challenging task driven by the inherent
complexity of the Earth system. Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for
addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture,
transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing
non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of
prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training
pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique
coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved
nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead
during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further
integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the
strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness
and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results
on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and
0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant
margin.

*Yidi Liu,Xueyang Fu,Jie Huang,Jie Xiao,Dong Li,Wenlong Zhang,Lei Bai,Zheng-Jun Zha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Latent Harmony是一个两阶段UHD图像恢复框架，通过联合正则化潜在空间和强制高频感知重建来重新定义VAE，在保持计算效率的同时恢复高频细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UHD图像恢复面临计算效率与高频细节保留之间的权衡。传统VAE的高斯约束会丢弃退化特定的高频信息，损害重建保真度。

Method: 第一阶段：LH-VAE通过视觉语义约束和渐进退化扰动增强语义鲁棒性，潜在等变性强化高频重建。第二阶段：使用HF-LoRA联合训练精炼的VAE和恢复模型，包含保真度导向的高频对齐损失和感知导向的损失，通过交替优化和选择性梯度传播训练。

Result: 实验表明Latent Harmony在UHD和标准分辨率任务上达到最先进性能，有效平衡效率、感知质量和重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重新定义VAE的潜在空间处理，成功解决了UHD图像恢复中效率与保真度的权衡问题，实现了灵活的质量控制。

Abstract: Ultra-High Definition (UHD) image restoration faces a trade-off between
computational efficiency and high-frequency detail retention. While Variational
Autoencoders (VAEs) improve efficiency via latent-space processing, their
Gaussian constraint often discards degradation-specific high-frequency
information, hurting reconstruction fidelity. To overcome this, we propose
Latent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration
by jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware
reconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic
robustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation
perturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency
reconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration
model using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA
guided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover
authentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to
synthesize realistic textures. Both LoRA modules are trained via alternating
optimization with selective gradient propagation to preserve the pretrained
latent structure.At inference, a tunable parameter {\alpha} enables flexible
fidelity-perception trade-offs.Experiments show Latent Harmony achieves
state-of-the-art performance across UHD and standard-resolution tasks,
effectively balancing efficiency, perceptual quality, and reconstruction
accuracy.

### [45] [The impact of abstract and object tags on image privacy classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07976)
*Darya Baranouskaya,Andrea Cavallaro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了在图像隐私分类任务中，对象标签和抽象标签的相对有效性。研究发现，在标签预算有限时，抽象标签更有效；而当每张图像可用标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对象标签表示具体实体，而抽象标签捕捉更高层次的上下文信息。在图像隐私这种依赖上下文且具有主观性的任务中，需要探索哪种类型的标签更适合。

Method: 通过比较对象标签和抽象标签在图像隐私分类中的表现，分析在不同标签数量限制下的效果差异。

Result: 当标签预算有限时，抽象标签比对象标签更有效；但当每张图像可用标签数量较多时，对象相关信息同样有用。

Conclusion: 这些发现将指导未来研究开发更准确的图像隐私分类器，考虑标签类型和数量的作用。

Abstract: Object tags denote concrete entities and are central to many computer vision
tasks, whereas abstract tags capture higher-level information, which is
relevant for tasks that require a contextual, potentially subjective scene
understanding. Object and abstract tags extracted from images also facilitate
interpretability. In this paper, we explore which type of tags is more suitable
for the context-dependent and inherently subjective task of image privacy.
While object tags are generally used for privacy classification, we show that
abstract tags are more effective when the tag budget is limited. Conversely,
when a larger number of tags per image is available, object-related information
is as useful. We believe that these findings will guide future research in
developing more accurate image privacy classifiers, informed by the role of tag
types and quantity.

TL;DR: 比较SwinIR Transformer模型与轻量级CNN在低光图像恢复任务中的性能-效率权衡，发现CNN在显著降低计算成本的同时仍能提供接近SOTA的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光图像恢复中高频细节恢复与严重噪声抑制的挑战，同时关注实际应用中计算效率的重要性

Method: 对比实验方法，将最先进的SwinIR Transformer模型与标准轻量级CNN在相同任务上进行性能与效率的全面比较

Result: SwinIR获得更高峰值性能(PSNR 39.03dB)，但轻量级CNN表现意外竞争性(PSNR 37.4dB)，且CNN仅需10个epoch收敛，模型大小比SwinIR小55倍

Conclusion: 标准CNN在显著降低计算开销的情况下能提供接近SOTA的结果，在资源受限的实际应用中具有明显优势

Abstract: The simultaneous restoration of high-frequency details and suppression of
severe noise in low-light imagery presents a significant and persistent
challenge in computer vision. While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR
have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can
be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical
trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art
SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but
important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher
peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the
lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially,
the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of
training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This
efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times
smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a
near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead,
presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource
constraints are a primary concern.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有低延迟、低能耗优势，适合便携电子设备和移动机器人等资源受限场景。传统RGB相机的人体姿态估计方法在事件数据上不适用，需要专门针对事件数据稀疏特性的新方法。

Method: 使用图神经网络GraphEnet，采用基于线的中间事件表示，结合新颖的偏移向量学习范式和基于置信度的池化来估计人体姿态。

Result: 实现了高频2D单人人体姿态估计，是首个将图神经网络应用于事件相机数据进行姿态估计的工作。

Conclusion: GraphEnet成功地将图神经网络应用于事件数据，为事件相机的人体姿态估计提供了有效的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Human Pose Estimation is a crucial module in human-machine interaction
applications and, especially since the rise in deep learning technology, robust
methods are available to consumers using RGB cameras and commercial GPUs. On
the other hand, event-based cameras have gained popularity in the vision
research community for their low latency and low energy advantages that make
them ideal for applications where those resources are constrained like portable
electronics and mobile robots. In this work we propose a Graph Neural Network,
GraphEnet, that leverages the sparse nature of event camera output, with an
intermediate line based event representation, to estimate 2D Human Pose of a
single person at a high frequency. The architecture incorporates a novel offset
vector learning paradigm with confidence based pooling to estimate the human
pose. This is the first work that applies Graph Neural Networks to event data
for Human Pose Estimation. The code is open-source at

TL;DR: CIR-CoT是一个端到端的检索导向多模态大语言模型，通过显式的思维链推理来提升组合图像检索的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有组合图像检索方法作为"黑盒"的问题，缺乏可解释性和处理复杂指令的能力。

Method: 采用思维链推理方法，通过三阶段过程生成结构化推理数据，然后微调模型产生结构化输出并编码检索意图到专用嵌入中。

Result: 在领域内数据集(FashionIQ、CIRR)上取得有竞争力的性能，在领域外数据集CIRCO上表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CIR-CoT为构建更有效和可信的检索系统开辟了新路径，通过可解释的推理过程提升了检索准确性和透明度。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), which aims to find a target image from a
reference image and a modification text, presents the core challenge of
performing unified reasoning across visual and semantic modalities. While
current approaches based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs, e.g., CLIP) and more
recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs, e.g., Qwen-VL) have shown
progress, they predominantly function as ``black boxes." This inherent opacity
not only prevents users from understanding the retrieval rationale but also
restricts the models' ability to follow complex, fine-grained instructions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce CIR-CoT, the first end-to-end
retrieval-oriented MLLM designed to integrate explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning. By compelling the model to first generate an interpretable reasoning
chain, CIR-CoT enhances its ability to capture crucial cross-modal
interactions, leading to more accurate retrieval while making its decision
process transparent. Since existing datasets like FashionIQ and CIRR lack the
necessary reasoning data, a key contribution of our work is the creation of
structured CoT annotations using a three-stage process involving a caption,
reasoning, and conclusion. Our model is then fine-tuned to produce this
structured output before encoding its final retrieval intent into a dedicated
embedding. Comprehensive experiments show that CIR-CoT achieves highly
competitive performance on in-domain datasets (FashionIQ, CIRR) and
demonstrates remarkable generalization on the out-of-domain CIRCO dataset,
establishing a new path toward more effective and trustworthy retrieval
systems.

Motivation: 解决基于相机的协作感知系统中因缺乏显式深度信息而难以生成准确3D目标检测预测的问题，缓解深度估计的模糊性。

Method: 提出基于射线的融合方法，利用协作车辆的射线占据信息来减少相机射线上的冗余和误报预测。

Result: 综合实验表明，该方法在协作视觉感知方面始终优于现有最先进模型，显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: RayFusion方法通过射线融合有效提升了纯相机协作感知系统的3D目标检测准确性，为自动驾驶视觉感知提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative visual perception methods have gained widespread attention in
the autonomous driving community in recent years due to their ability to
address sensor limitation problems. However, the absence of explicit depth
information often makes it difficult for camera-based perception systems, e.g.,
3D object detection, to generate accurate predictions. To alleviate the
ambiguity in depth estimation, we propose RayFusion, a ray-based fusion method
for collaborative visual perception. Using ray occupancy information from
collaborators, RayFusion reduces redundancy and false positive predictions
along camera rays, enhancing the detection performance of purely camera-based
collaborative perception systems. Comprehensive experiments show that our
method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, substantially
advancing the performance of collaborative visual perception. The code is
available at https://github.com/wangsh0111/RayFusion.

TL;DR: 提出RASALoRE：一种新颖的两阶段弱监督脑部MRI异常检测框架，通过双提示调优生成伪弱掩码，结合区域感知空间注意力机制，在减少参数量的同时实现最先进的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑部MRI扫描中弱监督异常检测的挑战，当精确的像素级标注不可用而仅有切片级弱标签可用时，需要快速准确地检测脑部异常。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用判别性双提示调优（DDPT）基于切片级标签生成高质量伪弱掩码；第二阶段采用带有区域感知空间注意力机制的分割网络，利用基于位置的随机嵌入有效聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在BraTS20、BraTS21、BraTS23和MSD数据集上的广泛评估显示，该方法在显著降低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的大幅提升，参数量少于800万。

Conclusion: RASALoRE框架在弱监督脑部MRI异常检测中达到了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法，同时保持了较低的计算复杂度。

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Anomaly detection (WSAD) in brain MRI scans is an important
challenge useful to obtain quick and accurate detection of brain anomalies when
precise pixel-level anomaly annotations are unavailable and only weak labels
(e.g., slice-level) are available. In this work, we propose RASALoRE: Region
Aware Spatial Attention with Location-based Random Embeddings, a novel
two-stage WSAD framework. In the first stage, we introduce a Discriminative
Dual Prompt Tuning (DDPT) mechanism that generates high-quality pseudo weak
masks based on slice-level labels, serving as coarse localization cues. In the
second stage, we propose a segmentation network with a region-aware spatial
attention mechanism that relies on fixed location-based random embeddings. This
design enables the model to effectively focus on anomalous regions. Our
approach achieves state-of-the-art anomaly detection performance, significantly
outperforming existing WSAD methods while utilizing less than 8 million
parameters. Extensive evaluations on the BraTS20, BraTS21, BraTS23, and MSD
datasets demonstrate a substantial performance improvement coupled with a
significant reduction in computational complexity. Code is available at:

TL;DR: RetouchLLM是一个无需训练的白盒图像润色系统，通过代码生成直接对高分辨率图像进行可解释的润色处理，模仿人类多步骤润色过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要大规模配对数据且作为黑盒运行，使得润色过程不透明，难以处理多样化的用户或图像特定调整。

Method: 系统包含视觉评论器（识别输入与参考图像差异）和代码生成器（生成可执行代码），以类似人类多步骤润色的方式逐步增强图像。

Result: 实验表明该方法能很好地泛化到不同的润色风格，基于自然语言的用户交互实现了可解释和可控的调整。

Conclusion: RetouchLLM提供了一种无需训练数据、可解释且可控的图像润色解决方案，能够根据用户意图进行定制化调整。

Abstract: Image retouching not only enhances visual quality but also serves as a means
of expressing personal preferences and emotions. However, existing
learning-based approaches require large-scale paired data and operate as black
boxes, making the retouching process opaque and limiting their adaptability to
handle diverse, user- or image-specific adjustments. In this work, we propose
RetouchLLM, a training-free white-box image retouching system, which requires
no training data and performs interpretable, code-based retouching directly on
high-resolution images. Our framework progressively enhances the image in a
manner similar to how humans perform multi-step retouching, allowing
exploration of diverse adjustment paths. It comprises of two main modules: a
visual critic that identifies differences between the input and reference
images, and a code generator that produces executable codes. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach generalizes well across diverse retouching
styles, while natural language-based user interaction enables interpretable and
controllable adjustments tailored to user intent.

Conclusion: 提出的模块化网络具有内在适应能力，通过分层方法有效提高了微类别级别的分类准确性，并在新目标区域表现出良好的特征学习能力。

Abstract: This work presents a multitemporal class-driven hierarchical Residual Neural
Network (ResNet) designed for modelling the classification of Time Series (TS)
of multispectral images at different semantical class levels. The architecture
consists of a modification of the ResNet where we introduce additional branches
to perform the classification at the different hierarchy levels and leverage on
hierarchy-penalty maps to discourage incoherent hierarchical transitions within
the classification. In this way, we improve the discrimination capabilities of
classes at different levels of semantic details and train a modular
architecture that can be used as a backbone network for introducing new
specific classes and additional tasks considering limited training samples
available. We exploit the class-hierarchy labels to train efficiently the
different layers of the architecture, allowing the first layers to train faster
on the first levels of the hierarchy modeling general classes (i.e., the
macro-classes) and the intermediate classes, while using the last ones to
discriminate more specific classes (i.e., the micro-classes). In this way, the
targets are constrained in following the hierarchy defined, improving the
classification of classes at the most detailed level. The proposed modular
network has intrinsic adaptation capability that can be obtained through fine
tuning. The experimental results, obtained on two tiles of the Amazonian Forest
on 12 monthly composites of Sentinel 2 images acquired during 2019, demonstrate
the effectiveness of the hierarchical approach in both generalizing over
different hierarchical levels and learning discriminant features for an
accurate classification at the micro-class level on a new target area, with a
better representation of the minoritarian classes.

Abstract: Deepfakes, leveraging advanced AIGC (Artificial Intelligence-Generated
Content) techniques, create hyper-realistic synthetic images and videos of
human faces, posing a significant threat to the authenticity of social media.
While this real-world threat is increasingly prevalent, existing academic
evaluations and benchmarks for detecting deepfake forgery often fall short to
achieve effective application for their lack of specificity, limited deepfake
diversity, restricted manipulation techniques.To address these limitations, we
introduce RedFace (Real-world-oriented Deepfake Face), a specialized facial
deepfake dataset, comprising over 60,000 forged images and 1,000 manipulated
videos derived from authentic facial features, to bridge the gap between
academic evaluations and real-world necessity. Unlike prior benchmarks, which
typically rely on academic methods to generate deepfakes, RedFace utilizes 9
commercial online platforms to integrate the latest deepfake technologies found
"in the wild", effectively simulating real-world black-box scenarios.Moreover,
RedFace's deepfakes are synthesized using bespoke algorithms, allowing it to
capture diverse and evolving methods used by real-world deepfake creators.
Extensive experimental results on RedFace (including cross-domain,
intra-domain, and real-world social network dissemination simulations) verify
the limited practicality of existing deepfake detection schemes against

Abstract: AI-generated videos have achieved near-perfect visual realism (e.g., Sora),
urgently necessitating reliable detection mechanisms. However, detecting such
videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal
dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this
paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based
on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a
statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the
ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly
capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained
diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients
approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion
decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we
propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum
Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a
detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances
between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit
amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments
confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall
and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD. The

TL;DR: DarkHash是首个针对深度哈希的无数据后门攻击方法，通过设计双语义引导的影子后门攻击框架，仅使用替代数据集微调受害者模型的特定层，即可在保持原始检索精度的同时嵌入后门功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度哈希后门攻击需要访问训练数据，但在现实世界中由于隐私保护和知识产权问题往往无法获取。如何在无训练数据访问的情况下对深度哈希模型植入后门，同时保持原始检索精度，是一个新颖且具有挑战性的问题。

Result: 在四个图像数据集、五种模型架构和两种哈希方法上的实验表明，DarkHash具有高有效性，优于现有最先进的后门攻击方法。防御实验显示DarkHash能够抵抗现有主流后门防御方法。

Conclusion: DarkHash成功实现了首个无数据后门攻击，在保持模型原始性能的同时有效植入后门，对深度哈希模型的安全性提出了新的挑战。

Abstract: Benefiting from its superior feature learning capabilities and efficiency,
deep hashing has achieved remarkable success in large-scale image retrieval.
Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep hashing models to
backdoor attacks. Although these studies have shown promising attack results,
they rely on access to the training dataset to implant the backdoor. In the
real world, obtaining such data (e.g., identity information) is often
prohibited due to privacy protection and intellectual property concerns.
Embedding backdoors into deep hashing models without access to the training
data, while maintaining retrieval accuracy for the original task, presents a
novel and challenging problem. In this paper, we propose DarkHash, the first
data-free backdoor attack against deep hashing. Specifically, we design a novel
shadow backdoor attack framework with dual-semantic guidance. It embeds
backdoor functionality and maintains original retrieval accuracy by fine-tuning
only specific layers of the victim model using a surrogate dataset. We consider
leveraging the relationship between individual samples and their neighbors to
enhance backdoor attacks during training. By designing a topological alignment
loss, we optimize both individual and neighboring poisoned samples toward the
target sample, further enhancing the attack capability. Experimental results on
four image datasets, five model architectures, and two hashing methods
demonstrate the high effectiveness of DarkHash, outperforming existing
state-of-the-art backdoor attack methods. Defense experiments show that
DarkHash can withstand existing mainstream backdoor defense methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于3D高斯溅射的标签精炼流程，通过联合拟合RGB图像和初始分割图的3DGS模型，生成多视角一致的精确分割掩码，显著提升极端视角下的人脸解析精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端视角下人脸解析因标注数据有限而面临的挑战，避免昂贵且难以规模化的人工标注。

Method: 联合拟合两个3DGS模型（RGB图像和初始分割图），通过共享几何结构强制多视角一致性，仅需少量后处理即可合成姿态多样的训练数据。

Result: 在精炼数据集上微调的人脸解析模型在挑战性头部姿态上显著提升精度，同时保持标准视图的强性能，无需真实3D标注且仅使用少量初始图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升真实场景中人脸解析鲁棒性提供了可扩展且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate face parsing under extreme viewing angles remains a significant
challenge due to limited labeled data in such poses. Manual annotation is
costly and often impractical at scale. We propose a novel label refinement
pipeline that leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to generate accurate
segmentation masks from noisy multiview predictions. By jointly fitting two
3DGS models, one to RGB images and one to their initial segmentation maps, our
method enforces multiview consistency through shared geometry, enabling the
synthesis of pose-diverse training data with only minimal post-processing.
Fine-tuning a face parsing model on this refined dataset significantly improves
accuracy on challenging head poses, while maintaining strong performance on
standard views. Extensive experiments, including human evaluations, demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art
methods, despite requiring no ground-truth 3D annotations and using only a
small set of initial images. Our method offers a scalable and effective
solution for improving face parsing robustness in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 随机窗宽调整是一种有效的CT特定增强技术，能够显著提升肝脏肿瘤分割模型的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) is important for diagnosis and
treatment planning for various medical conditions. Deep learning (DL) based
segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting
and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload.
Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as
radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation.
However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to
CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities
measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper
challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows
that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we
propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that
exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random
windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly
increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing.
We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and
compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on
the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.

Conclusion: AR-Drag在实时运动可控视频生成方面取得了显著进展，平衡了生成质量、控制精度和计算效率。

Abstract: Real-time motion-controllable video generation remains challenging due to the
inherent latency of bidirectional diffusion models and the lack of effective
autoregressive (AR) approaches. Existing AR video diffusion models are limited
to simple control signals or text-to-video generation, and often suffer from
quality degradation and motion artifacts in few-step generation. To address
these challenges, we propose AR-Drag, the first RL-enhanced few-step AR video
diffusion model for real-time image-to-video generation with diverse motion
control. We first fine-tune a base I2V model to support basic motion control,
then further improve it via reinforcement learning with a trajectory-based
reward model. Our design preserves the Markov property through a Self-Rollout
mechanism and accelerates training by selectively introducing stochasticity in
denoising steps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AR-Drag achieves high
visual fidelity and precise motion alignment, significantly reducing latency
compared with state-of-the-art motion-controllable VDMs, while using only 1.3B
parameters. Additional visualizations can be found on our project page:

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种注意力增强方法TCAS，通过提高视频语言模型中跨模态注意力头的时间分辨能力，解决模型对重述问题产生逻辑不一致响应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生自相矛盾的输出，严重影响其可靠性。在视频语言模型中，这种现象表现为模型无法基于其基础输出对重述问题提供逻辑一致的响应，但这种现象的根本原因尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 采用可解释性驱动的方法分析、统计总结和干预该现象的潜在因素。提出了时间条件注意力锐化(TCAS)方法，基于注意力差异构建增强目标，提升模型的时间分辨能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著提升了视频语言模型的时间逻辑一致性。可解释性分析证实该方法确实改善了注意力头的时间区分能力。此外，在通用视频时间定位任务中也实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: 时间逻辑一致性是时间理解的瓶颈，通过增强一致性，该方法推动了视频时间理解的显著进展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which
severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical
applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently
draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide
logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding
outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain
underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to
analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the
phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in
responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively
distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we
propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention
Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention
distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby
improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic
consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our
method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads,
validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance
improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that
temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By
enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal
understanding.

Abstract: Cascaded video super-resolution has emerged as a promising technique for
decoupling the computational burden associated with generating high-resolution
videos using large foundation models. Existing studies, however, are largely
confined to text-to-video tasks and fail to leverage additional generative
conditions beyond text, which are crucial for ensuring fidelity in multi-modal
video generation. We address this limitation by presenting UniMMVSR, the first
unified generative video super-resolution framework to incorporate hybrid-modal
conditions, including text, images, and videos. We conduct a comprehensive
exploration of condition injection strategies, training schemes, and data
mixture techniques within a latent video diffusion model. A key challenge was
designing distinct data construction and condition utilization methods to
enable the model to precisely utilize all condition types, given their varied
correlations with the target video. Our experiments demonstrate that UniMMVSR
significantly outperforms existing methods, producing videos with superior
detail and a higher degree of conformity to multi-modal conditions. We also
validate the feasibility of combining UniMMVSR with a base model to achieve
multi-modal guided generation of 4K video, a feat previously unattainable with
existing techniques.

Conclusion: MURE框架通过多模态链式思维显著提升了图像编辑的精度和保真度，为解决复杂视觉编辑任务提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Image editing with natural language has gained significant popularity, yet
existing methods struggle with intricate object intersections and fine-grained
spatial relationships due to the lack of an explicit reasoning process. While
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has been explored to enhance reasoning, purely textual
CoT or CoT augmented with coordinate information is fundamentally limited in
its ability to represent intricate visual layouts and lacks the necessary
visual cues to guide the generation of fine-grained, pixel-level details. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Reasoning Edit (MURE), a novel
framework that shifts the visual editing process from purely text-based
reasoning to a series of interleaved textual and visual rationales. Our
framework performs image editing using a natively multimodal, interleaved
text-image CoT. This approach generates a step-by-step chain of reasoning where
a textual description is followed by a corresponding visual cue, such as a
positional mask that defined intended edited regions or a representation of new
content. Furthermore, to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon of large
language models, we introduce Multimodal Deep Confidence (MMDC) reasoning
paradigm. This paradigm explores a tree of visual reasoning paths at each step.
By pruning low-quality branches using a deep confidence score from a reward
model, it ensures the model consistently follows a high-quality trajectory
towards the final edited result. The proposed method decomposes complex editing
tasks into interdependent sub-tasks, achieving greater precision at each stage
and yielding high-fidelity edited results. We define the formulation for
interleaved text-image chains and release the first CoT-Edit-14K dataset,
comprising 14K high-quality editing examples. Extensive experiments show that
our method yields significant improvements across three image editing
benchmarks.

Conclusion: 自举算法能有效处理几何偏差，在细粒度视觉分类中表现出色，为规范化方法提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird
identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust
to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and
noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies
rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on
equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost.
Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the
downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using
canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately,
real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained
canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that
iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and
recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under
mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks
that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization
baselines while performing on par with augmentation.

Conclusion: InstructUDrag成功解决了现有方法的局限性，通过结合文本指令和对象拖拽实现了精确的对象定位和细粒度的语义控制。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have shown great potential for image editing,
with techniques such as text-based and object-dragging methods emerging as key
approaches. However, each of these methods has inherent limitations: text-based
methods struggle with precise object positioning, while object dragging methods
are confined to static relocation. To address these issues, we propose
InstructUDrag, a diffusion-based framework that combines text instructions with
object dragging, enabling simultaneous object dragging and text-based image
editing. Our framework treats object dragging as an image reconstruction
process, divided into two synergistic branches. The moving-reconstruction
branch utilizes energy-based gradient guidance to move objects accurately,
refining cross-attention maps to enhance relocation precision. The text-driven
editing branch shares gradient signals with the reconstruction branch, ensuring
consistent transformations and allowing fine-grained control over object
attributes. We also employ DDPM inversion and inject prior information into
noise maps to preserve the structure of moved objects. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that InstructUDrag facilitates flexible, high-fidelity image
editing, offering both precision in object relocation and semantic control over
image content.

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently dynamic and hierarchical, where the dynamic
refers to the motion changes with distance, and the hierarchy is from
individual to inter-individual and ultimately to overall motion. Exploiting
these properties is vital for dual-human motion generation, while existing
methods almost model human interaction temporally invariantly, ignoring
distance and hierarchy. To address it, we propose a fine-grained dual-human
motion generation method, namely FineDual, a tri-stage method to model the
dynamic hierarchical interaction from individual to inter-individual. The first
stage, Self-Learning Stage, divides the dual-human overall text into individual
texts through a Large Language Model, aligning text features and motion
features at the individual level. The second stage, Adaptive Adjustment Stage,
predicts interaction distance by an interaction distance predictor, modeling
human interactions dynamically at the inter-individual level by an
interaction-aware graph network. The last stage, Teacher-Guided Refinement
Stage, utilizes overall text features as guidance to refine motion features at
the overall level, generating fine-grained and high-quality dual-human motion.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on dual-human motion
datasets demonstrate that our proposed FineDual outperforms existing
approaches, effectively modeling dynamic hierarchical human interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像的多标签分类比单标签分类能提供更全面的语义理解，但获取完整标注成本高昂。单正多标签学习(SPML)作为实用替代方案，每个图像只标注一个相关标签，但需要模型恢复完整标签集。然而SPML存在监督模糊性问题，且在遥感领域研究有限。

Method: 提出自适应梯度校准(AdaGC)框架，包含梯度校准机制、Mixup技术和双EMA模块用于生成鲁棒的伪标签。引入基于训练动态的自适应触发机制，在预热阶段后根据训练状态自适应启动梯度校准，有效缓解对标签噪声的过拟合。

Result: 在两个遥感基准数据集和两种不同标签噪声类型下的广泛实验表明，AdaGC实现了最先进的性能，并在多样化设置中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGC是针对遥感图像SPML任务的有效解决方案，通过自适应梯度校准机制成功解决了监督模糊性问题，在保持鲁棒性的同时达到了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) offers a more comprehensive semantic
understanding of Remote Sensing (RS) imagery compared to traditional
single-label classification (SLC). However, obtaining complete annotations for
MLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the
labeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label
learning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one
relevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.
While scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding
specialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have
been proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains
limited. To bridge this gap, we propose Adaptive Gradient Calibration (AdaGC),
a novel and generalizable SPML framework tailored to RS imagery. AdaGC adopts a
gradient calibration (GC) mechanism combined with Mixup and a dual exponential
moving average (EMA) module for robust pseudo-label generation. To maximize
AdaGC's effectiveness, we introduce a simple yet theoretically grounded
indicator to adaptively trigger GC after an initial warm-up stage based on
training dynamics, thereby guaranteeing the effectiveness of GC in mitigating
overfitting to label noise. Extensive experiments on two benchmark RS datasets
under two distinct label noise types demonstrate that AdaGC achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining strong robustness across
diverse settings.

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims at reconstructing the masked regions as per
text prompts, where the longstanding challenges lie in the preservation for
unmasked regions, while achieving the semantics consistency between unmasked
and inpainted masked regions. Previous arts failed to address both of them,
always with either of them to be remedied. Such facts, as we observed, stem
from the entanglement of the hybrid (e.g., mid-and-low) frequency bands that
encode varied image properties, which exhibit different robustness to text
prompts during the denoising process. In this paper, we propose a
null-text-null frequency-aware diffusion models, dubbed \textbf{NTN-Diff}, for
text-guided image inpainting, by decomposing the semantics consistency across
masked and unmasked regions into the consistencies as per each frequency band,
while preserving the unmasked regions, to circumvent two challenges in a row.
Based on the diffusion process, we further divide the denoising process into
early (high-level noise) and late (low-level noise) stages, where the
mid-and-low frequency bands are disentangled during the denoising process. As
observed, the stable mid-frequency band is progressively denoised to be
semantically aligned during text-guided denoising process, which, meanwhile,
serves as the guidance to the null-text denoising process to denoise
low-frequency band for the masked regions, followed by a subsequent text-guided
denoising process at late stage, to achieve the semantics consistency for
mid-and-low frequency bands across masked and unmasked regions, while preserve
the unmasked regions. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of
NTN-Diff over the state-of-the-art diffusion models to text-guided diffusion
models. Our code can be accessed from https://github.com/htyjers/NTN-Diff.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的具身参考理解框架，通过结合LLM数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，在复杂环境中更准确地识别目标物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放词汇物体检测方法在存在多个候选物体的模糊场景中经常失败的问题。

Method: 联合利用基于LLM的数据增强、深度图模态和深度感知决策模块，实现语言和具身线索的稳健集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，实现了更准确可靠的参考检测。

Conclusion: 提出的ERU框架能够有效处理复杂或杂乱环境中的消歧问题，提升具身参考理解的性能。

Abstract: Embodied Reference Understanding requires identifying a target object in a
visual scene based on both language instructions and pointing cues. While prior
works have shown progress in open-vocabulary object detection, they often fail
in ambiguous scenarios where multiple candidate objects exist in the scene. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel ERU framework that jointly
leverages LLM-based data augmentation, depth-map modality, and a depth-aware
decision module. This design enables robust integration of linguistic and
embodied cues, improving disambiguation in complex or cluttered environments.
Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving more accurate and
reliable referent detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Neural Exposure Fields (NExF)，通过为每个3D点预测最佳曝光值，在具有强曝光变化的挑战性场景中实现高质量的3D重建和视图合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经场景表示在处理包含强曝光变化的数据时（如室内外混合场景或带窗户的房间），输出质量会下降。需要一种能够鲁棒处理真实世界捕获中曝光变化的方法。

Method: 学习一个预测每个3D点最佳曝光值的神经场，通过新型神经调节机制联合优化场景表示和曝光场，无需后处理或多曝光捕获。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最佳基线提高超过55%，训练速度更快。

Conclusion: NExF能够准确合成高动态范围场景的视图，为处理真实世界曝光变化提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural scene representations have led to unprecedented
quality in 3D reconstruction and view synthesis. Despite achieving high-quality
results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data
that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present,
e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In
this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for
robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent
appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to
learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point,
enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation.
While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel,
we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables
accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of
post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a
novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint
optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel
neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on
challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior
works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by
over 55% over best-performing baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种有效的长程时序上下文注意力机制（LTCA），通过稀疏局部注意力堆叠和全局查询设计，在指代视频分割任务中实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指代视频分割中如何有效提取长程时序上下文信息的问题，现有方法在局部性和全局性之间平衡不佳，且计算复杂度随视频长度增加而显著上升。

Method: 提出LTCA机制：1）堆叠稀疏局部注意力（扩张窗口注意力）平衡局部性和全局性；2）每个查询可以关注从全局池中随机选择的一小组键来增强全局性；3）设计全局查询与所有其他查询交互以直接编码全局上下文信息。

Result: 在四个指代视频分割基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在MeViS valu和val数据集上分别提升了11.3%和8.3%。

Conclusion: LTCA机制能够有效平衡局部性和全局性，显著提升指代视频分割性能，同时控制计算复杂度。

Abstract: Referring Video Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment objects in videos given
linguistic expressions. The key to solving RVOS is to extract long-range
temporal context information from the interactions of expressions and videos to
depict the dynamic attributes of each object. Previous works either adopt
attention across all the frames or stack dense local attention to achieve a
global view of temporal context. However, they fail to strike a good balance
between locality and globality, and the computation complexity significantly
increases with the increase of video length. In this paper, we propose an
effective long-range temporal context attention (LTCA) mechanism to aggregate
global context information into object features. Specifically, we aggregate the
global context information from two aspects. Firstly, we stack sparse local
attentions to balance the locality and globality. We design a dilated window
attention across frames to aggregate local context information and perform such
attention in a stack of layers to enable a global view. Further, we enable each
query to attend to a small group of keys randomly selected from a global pool
to enhance the globality. Secondly, we design a global query to interact with
all the other queries to directly encode the global context information.
Experiments show our method achieves new state-of-the-art on four referring
video segmentation benchmarks. Notably, our method shows an improvement of
11.3% and 8.3% on the MeViS valu and val datasets respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义基础的学习范式，将大规模2D视觉基础模型的丰富语义知识迁移到3D领域，通过跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)预训练策略和跨模态可操作性分割Transformer(CAST)，在3D可操作性分割任务上取得了新的最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D可操作性分割方法通常使用点云编码器作为通用特征提取器，但忽略了3D数据固有的挑战（如稀疏性、噪声和几何模糊性），导致学习到的3D特征缺乏清晰且语义一致的功能边界。

Method: 1. 提出跨模态亲和力转移(CMAT)预训练策略，将3D编码器与提升的2D语义对齐，并联合优化重建、亲和力和多样性；2. 设计跨模态可操作性分割Transformer(CAST)，集成多模态提示与CMAT预训练特征，生成精确的提示感知分割图。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该框架在3D可操作性分割任务上建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 通过将2D视觉基础模型的语义知识迁移到3D领域，能够有效解决3D数据的内在挑战，生成语义一致的功能边界，提升3D可操作性分割的性能。

Abstract: Affordance segmentation aims to parse 3D objects into functionally distinct
parts, bridging recognition and interaction for applications in robotic
manipulation, embodied AI, and AR. While recent studies leverage visual or
textual prompts to guide this process, they often rely on point cloud encoders
as generic feature extractors, overlooking the intrinsic challenges of 3D data
such as sparsity, noise, and geometric ambiguity. As a result, 3D features
learned in isolation frequently lack clear and semantically consistent
functional boundaries. To address this bottleneck, we propose a
semantic-grounded learning paradigm that transfers rich semantic knowledge from
large-scale 2D Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) into the 3D domain.
Specifically, We introduce Cross-Modal Affinity Transfer (CMAT), a pre-training
strategy that aligns a 3D encoder with lifted 2D semantics and jointly
optimizes reconstruction, affinity, and diversity to yield semantically
organized representations. Building on this backbone, we further design the
Cross-modal Affordance Segmentation Transformer (CAST), which integrates
multi-modal prompts with CMAT-pretrained features to generate precise,
prompt-aware segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework establishes new state-of-the-art results for 3D
affordance segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinVideo是一个高效的无数据后训练框架，通过将自注意力模块替换为线性注意力来降低视频扩散模型的计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频扩散模型的自注意力计算成本随序列长度呈二次方增长，而线性注意力虽然能降低计算成本，但由于表达能力有限和时空建模复杂性，完全替换需要昂贵的预训练。

Method: 提出选择性转移方法，将层选择作为二元分类问题，自动渐进地将层转换为线性注意力；引入任意时间分布匹配(ADM)目标，在采样轨迹的任何时间步对齐样本分布。

Result: 实验显示该方法实现了1.25-2.00倍加速，同时保持生成质量；4步蒸馏模型进一步实现15.92倍延迟降低，视觉质量下降最小。

Conclusion: LinVideo框架有效解决了视频扩散模型计算效率问题，通过选择性层替换和分布匹配目标，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Video diffusion models (DMs) have enabled high-quality video synthesis.
However, their computation costs scale quadratically with sequence length
because self-attention has quadratic complexity. While linear attention lowers
the cost, fully replacing quadratic attention requires expensive pretraining
due to the limited expressiveness of linear attention and the complexity of
spatiotemporal modeling in video generation. In this paper, we present
LinVideo, an efficient data-free post-training framework that replaces a target
number of self-attention modules with linear attention while preserving the
original model's performance. First, we observe a significant disparity in the
replaceability of different layers. Instead of manual or heuristic choices, we
frame layer selection as a binary classification problem and propose selective
transfer, which automatically and progressively converts layers to linear
attention with minimal performance impact. Additionally, to overcome the
ineffectiveness and inefficiency of existing objectives for this transfer
process, we introduce an anytime distribution matching (ADM) objective that
aligns the distributions of samples across any timestep along the sampling
trajectory. This objective is efficient and recovers model performance.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a 1.25-2.00x speedup while
preserving generation quality, and our 4-step distilled model further delivers
a 15.92x latency reduction with minimal visual quality drop.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要可靠的感知能力，特别是在处理远距离物体时。现有视觉语言模型在安全关键应用中需要验证其感知性能，特别是针对小型模型在资源受限环境下的表现。

Method: 创建DTPQA基准，仅包含基于感知的问题并排除需要推理的问题，添加距离标注。评估多个最先进的小型视觉语言模型在该基准上的表现，并与人类性能对比。

Result: 最佳小型视觉语言模型的平均准确率约为60%，远低于人类的85%性能。模型在区分左右等特定感知任务上表现尤其困难。

Conclusion: 当前小型视觉语言模型在交通场景感知任务上仍有显著不足，特别是在远距离感知和方向辨别方面，需要进一步改进才能满足自动驾驶系统的安全要求。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are becoming increasingly powerful,
demonstrating strong performance on a variety of tasks that require both visual
and textual understanding. Their strong generalisation abilities make them a
promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected
corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a
model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical
objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require
systems that are not "shortsighted", i.e., systems with strong perception
capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With
this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question
Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused
solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance
annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that
model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated
driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs,
our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several
state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the
simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared
to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85%
human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size
was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify
specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain
particularly challenging for these models.

Abstract: We introduce a simple and efficient method to enhance and clarify images.
More specifically, we deal with low light image enhancement and clarification
of hazy imagery (hazy/foggy images, images containing sand dust, and underwater

or hazy conditions and deriving approximate reverse filters to minimize
distortions in the enhanced images. Experimental results show that our approach
is highly competitive and often surpasses state-of-the-art techniques in
handling extremely dark images and in enhancing hazy images. A key advantage of
our approach lies in its simplicity: Our method is implementable with just a
few lines of MATLAB code.

Motivation: 新一代高光谱卫星传感器和深度学习方法虽然提升了土地覆盖分类能力，但在小样本数据集上训练时存在过拟合风险，需要有效的数据增强技术。

Method: 使用引导扩散模型进行数据增强，结合轻量级Transformer网络捕获数据复杂模式，采用改进的加权损失函数和优化的余弦方差调度器实现小数据集上的快速有效训练。

Result: 在PRISMA卫星获取的10种森林类型高光谱图像分类任务中，该方法在平均准确率和加权平均准确率上均优于其他数据增强技术，且训练过程稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了深度生成模型在数据增强应用中的常见限制，为小样本高光谱图像分类提供了稳定有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of new generation hyperspectral satellite sensors, combined
with advancements in deep learning methodologies, has significantly enhanced
the ability to discriminate detailed land-cover classes at medium-large scales.
However, a significant challenge in deep learning methods is the risk of
overfitting when training networks with small labeled datasets. In this work,
we propose a data augmentation technique that leverages a guided diffusion
model. To effectively train the model with a limited number of labeled samples
and to capture complex patterns in the data, we implement a lightweight
transformer network. Additionally, we introduce a modified weighted loss
function and an optimized cosine variance scheduler, which facilitate fast and
effective training on small datasets. We evaluate the effectiveness of the
proposed method on a forest classification task with 10 different forest types
using hyperspectral images acquired by the PRISMA satellite. The results
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other data augmentation
techniques in both average and weighted average accuracy. The effectiveness of
the method is further highlighted by the stable training behavior of the model,
which addresses a common limitation in the practical application of deep
generative models for data augmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一多模态模型主要局限于图像领域，需要扩展到视频领域来处理复杂的多模态指令并保持视觉一致性。

Method: 采用双流架构：多模态大语言模型（MLLM）理解指令，多模态DiT（MMDiT）生成视频，通过联合训练统一处理多种视频生成和编辑任务。

Result: UniVideo在文本/图像到视频生成、上下文视频生成和编辑等任务上达到或超越了最先进的特定任务基线，并展示了任务组合和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniVideo成功将统一建模扩展到视频领域，支持任务组合和跨模态泛化，为未来视频生成研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have shown promising results in multimodal content
generation and editing but remain largely limited to the image domain. In this
work, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling
to the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a
Multimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate
interpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual
consistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video
generation and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and
is jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo
matches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in
text/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context
video editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of
generalization. First, UniVideo supports task composition, such as combining
editing with style transfer, by integrating multiple capabilities within a
single instruction. Second, even without explicit training on free-form video
editing, UniVideo transfers its editing capability from large-scale image
editing data to this setting, handling unseen instructions such as
green-screening characters or changing materials within a video. Beyond these
core capabilities, UniVideo also supports visual-prompt-based video generation,
where the MLLM interprets visual prompts and guides the MMDiT during synthesis.
To foster future research, we will release our model and code.

Motivation: 历史地图图例对于解释地图符号至关重要，但其布局不一致和非结构化格式使得自动提取具有挑战性。现有方法主要关注分割或通用OCR，缺乏有效匹配图例符号与描述的方法。

Method: 使用LayoutLMv3进行布局检测，结合GPT-4o通过上下文学习来检测和链接图例项及其描述，利用边界框预测实现结构化匹配。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展的、布局感知的图例解析，提高了不同视觉风格历史地图的索引和可搜索性。

Abstract: Historical map legends are critical for interpreting cartographic symbols.
However, their inconsistent layouts and unstructured formats make automatic
extraction challenging. Prior work focuses primarily on segmentation or general
optical character recognition (OCR), with few methods effectively matching
legend symbols to their corresponding descriptions in a structured manner. We
present a method that combines LayoutLMv3 for layout detection with GPT-4o
using in-context learning to detect and link legend items and their
descriptions via bounding box predictions. Our experiments show that GPT-4 with
structured JSON prompts outperforms the baseline, achieving 88% F-1 and 85%

Conclusion: 提出的课程学习框架有效解决了源自由域自适应问题，在医疗图像分割任务中表现出色，为数据隐私保护提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have uncovered a new research line, namely source-free domain
adaptation, which adapts a model to target domains without using the source
data. Such a setting can address the concerns on data privacy and security
issues of medical images. However, current source-free domain adaptation
frameworks mainly focus on the pseudo label refinement for target data without
the consideration of learning procedure. Indeed, a progressive learning process
from source to target domain will benefit the knowledge transfer during model
adaptation. To this end, we propose a curriculum-based framework, namely
learning from curriculum (LFC), for source-free domain adaptation, which
consists of easy-to-hard and source-to-target curricula. Concretely, the former
curriculum enables the framework to start learning with `easy' samples and
gradually tune the optimization direction of model adaption by increasing the
sample difficulty. While, the latter can stablize the adaptation process, which
ensures smooth transfer of the model from the source domain to the target. We
evaluate the proposed source-free domain adaptation approach on the public
cross-domain datasets for fundus segmentation and polyp segmentation. The
extensive experimental results show that our framework surpasses the existing
approaches and achieves a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估最先进的T2V模型，缺乏对事件级时间因果关系和世界知识的系统性评估，而这些对于构建世界模型至关重要。

Method: 收集跨领域代表性视频，提取具有时间因果关系的事件级描述，通过独立标注者重写为文本到视频提示，设计包含10个评估维度的二元评估问题，并开发基于现代视觉语言模型的人类偏好对齐评估流程。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了关于当前T2V生成器与世界模型之间差距的深入分析，为评估T2V模型的复杂理解能力提供了全面基准。

Abstract: The recent rapid advancement of Text-to-Video (T2V) generation technologies,
which are critical to build ``world models'', makes the existing benchmarks
increasingly insufficient to evaluate state-of-the-art T2V models. First,
current evaluation dimensions, such as per-frame aesthetic quality and temporal
consistency, are no longer able to differentiate state-of-the-art T2V models.
Second, event-level temporal causality, which not only distinguishes video from
other modalities but also constitutes a crucial component of world models, is
severely underexplored in existing benchmarks. Third, existing benchmarks lack
a systematic assessment of world knowledge, which are essential capabilities
for building world models. To address these issues, we introduce VideoVerse, a
comprehensive benchmark that focuses on evaluating whether a T2V model could
understand complex temporal causality and world knowledge in the real world. We
collect representative videos across diverse domains (e.g., natural landscapes,
sports, indoor scenes, science fiction, chemical and physical experiments) and
extract their event-level descriptions with inherent temporal causality, which
are then rewritten into text-to-video prompts by independent annotators. For
each prompt, we design a suite of binary evaluation questions from the
perspective of dynamic and static properties, with a total of ten carefully
defined evaluation dimensions. In total, our VideoVerse comprises 300 carefully
curated prompts, involving 815 events and 793 binary evaluation questions.
Consequently, a human preference aligned QA-based evaluation pipeline is
developed by using modern vision-language models. Finally, we perform a
systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source T2V
models on VideoVerse, providing in-depth analysis on how far the current T2V
generators are from world models.

TL;DR: 本文首次将连续时间一致性蒸馏扩展到通用应用级图像和视频扩散模型，提出了分数正则化连续时间一致性模型(rCM)，解决了sCM在细节生成中的质量限制，在14B参数模型和5秒视频上实现15-50倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然连续时间一致性模型(sCM)在学术规模扩散加速中表现优异，但其在大规模文本到图像和视频任务中的适用性仍不明确，主要面临JVP计算的基础设施挑战和标准评估基准的限制。

Method: 开发并行兼容的FlashAttention-2 JVP内核，支持10B+参数模型训练；提出rCM模型，通过分数蒸馏作为长跳跃正则器，结合前向散度的"模式覆盖"和反向散度的"模式寻求"特性。

Result: 在Cosmos-Predict2、Wan2.1等14B参数模型和5秒视频上验证，rCM在质量指标上匹配或超越最先进的DMD2蒸馏方法，同时在多样性方面具有显著优势，仅需1-4步即可生成高保真样本。

Conclusion: rCM为推进大规模扩散蒸馏提供了一个实用且理论基础的框架，实现了15-50倍的扩散采样加速，无需GAN调优或大量超参数搜索。

Abstract: This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency
distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models.
Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled
and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its
applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due
to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and
the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a
parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on
models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our
investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail
generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the "mode-covering"
nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the
score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates
score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM
with the "mode-seeking" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual
quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale
models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM
matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality

*Andrew Lee,Ian Chuang,Dechen Gao,Kai Fukazawa,Iman Soltani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Gaze on the Prize框架，通过可学习的中央凹注意力机制和基于回报差异的自监督信号，提升视觉强化学习的样本效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉RL代理需要处理高维图像数据，但只有少量像素与任务相关，导致探索和计算资源浪费在无关特征上，造成样本效率低下和学习不稳定。

Method: 引入可学习的中央凹注意力机制，通过回报引导的对比学习训练注意力：基于回报差异将相似视觉表示分组为正负样本，构建对比三元组，教导注意力机制为不同结果的状态生成可区分的表示。

Result: 在ManiSkill3基准测试的多个操作任务中，样本效率提升高达2.4倍，能够解决基线方法无法学习的任务，且无需修改底层算法或超参数。

Conclusion: 基于回报差异的注意力机制能够有效识别任务相关特征，显著提升视觉强化学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: Visual Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents must learn to act based on
high-dimensional image data where only a small fraction of the pixels is
task-relevant. This forces agents to waste exploration and computational
resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable
learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce
Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal
attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the
agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that
return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations
produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely
task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized
through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to
distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group
similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their
return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive
triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention
mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with
different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample
efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated
across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without
modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.

TL;DR: 提出一个模块化空间图像处理框架，包含灰度量化、色彩增强、图像锐化、双向变换管道和几何特征提取等功能，在多样化数据集上表现出稳健性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个综合性的图像处理框架，能够处理从基础量化到高级特征提取的多种任务，满足实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的需求。

Method: 采用模块化设计，包括：灰度强度变换量化、RGB和YCrCb色彩空间直方图均衡化、HSV亮度调整、3×3卷积核图像锐化、双向变换管道（包含反锐化掩模、伽马校正和噪声放大），以及Canny边缘检测、Hough线估计、Harris角点检测等几何特征提取方法。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架在图像处理任务中表现出色，具有实时图像分析和计算机视觉应用的潜力，为复杂视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This study introduces a modular framework for spatial image processing,
integrating grayscale quantization, color and brightness enhancement, image
sharpening, bidirectional transformation pipelines, and geometric feature
extraction. A stepwise intensity transformation quantizes grayscale images into
eight discrete levels, producing a posterization effect that simplifies
representation while preserving structural detail. Color enhancement is
achieved via histogram equalization in both RGB and YCrCb color spaces, with
the latter improving contrast while maintaining chrominance fidelity.
Brightness adjustment is implemented through HSV value-channel manipulation,
and image sharpening is performed using a 3 * 3 convolution kernel to enhance
high-frequency details. A bidirectional transformation pipeline that integrates
unsharp masking, gamma correction, and noise amplification achieved accuracy
levels of 76.10% and 74.80% for the forward and reverse processes,
respectively. Geometric feature extraction employed Canny edge detection,
Hough-based line estimation (e.g., 51.50{\deg} for billiard cue alignment),
Harris corner detection, and morphological window localization. Cue isolation
further yielded 81.87\% similarity against ground truth images. Experimental
evaluation across diverse datasets demonstrates robust and deterministic
performance, highlighting its potential for real-time image analysis and
computer vision.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在开放词汇场景中依赖文本先验，难以区分语义相似的动作，存在跨模态幻觉问题。

Method: 将动作分解为可区分的子动作进行细粒度匹配，同时动态调用领域特定工具进行跨模态交织，通过分层奖励机制平衡工具使用效率、子动作相关性和推理结构一致性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
potential in bridging visual and textual reasoning, yet their reliance on
text-centric priors often limits their ability to disentangle semantically
similar actions in open-vocabulary scenarios. To address this, we propose
Video-STAR, a framework that harmonizes contextual sub-motion decomposition
with tool-augmented reinforcement learning for open-vocabulary action
recognition (OVAR). Unlike prior methods that treat actions as monolithic
entities, our approach innovatively decomposes actions into discriminative
sub-motions for fine-grained matching while dynamically invoking
domain-specific tools for cross-modal interleaving, thereby enabling
category-specific reasoning capacity and reducing cross-modal hallucination.
Moreover, by designing a hierarchical reward that balances tool-usage
efficiency, sub-motion relevance, and structural coherence in reasoning, our
method autonomously leverages external tools to prioritize sub-motion patterns
without explicit supervision, transmitting from text-centric reasoning to
visually grounded inference. Extensive evaluations on HMDB-51, UCF-101, SSv2,
Kinetics-400, and Kinetics-600 datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in distinguishing fine-grained
actions and handling cross-modal hallucination, validating our excellent
robustness and generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手语中的象似性（语言形式与意义的相似性）为视觉基础提供了自然测试平台，研究旨在评估视觉语言模型从动态人体运动中恢复这种基本映射的能力。

Method: 引入视觉象似性挑战基准，基于荷兰手语数据，在零样本和少样本设置下评估13个最先进的视觉语言模型，包含三个任务：音系手形预测、透明度推断和分级象似性评分。

Result: 模型在音系形式预测上能恢复部分手形和位置细节但低于人类表现；在透明度任务上远低于人类基线；只有顶级模型与人类象似性评分有中等相关性。有趣的是，音系形式预测更强的模型与人类象似性判断相关性更好。

Conclusion: 验证了这些诊断任务的有效性，表明需要人类中心信号和具身学习方法建模象似性，以改进多模态模型的视觉基础能力。

Abstract: Iconicity, the resemblance between linguistic form and meaning, is pervasive
in signed languages, offering a natural testbed for visual grounding. For
vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential
mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the
\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts
psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological
sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring
meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$
state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the
Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \textit{phonological form
prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below
human performance; on \textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines;
and only top models correlate moderately with human \textit{iconicity ratings}.
Interestingly, \textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction
correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity
to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks
and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling
iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.

Abstract: With recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) showing
strong visual understanding and reasoning, interest is growing in using them to
improve the editing performance of diffusion models. Despite rapid progress,
most studies lack an in-depth analysis of MLLM design choices. Moreover, the
integration of MLLMs and diffusion models remains an open challenge in some
difficult tasks, such as video editing. In this paper, we present InstructX, a
unified framework for image and video editing. Specifically, we conduct a
comprehensive study on integrating MLLMs and diffusion models for
instruction-driven editing across diverse tasks. Building on this study, we
analyze the cooperation and distinction between images and videos in unified
modeling. (1) We show that training on image data can lead to emergent video
editing capabilities without explicit supervision, thereby alleviating the
constraints imposed by scarce video training data. (2) By incorporating
modality-specific MLLM features, our approach effectively unifies image and
video editing tasks within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method can handle a broad range of image and video editing tasks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: MoA-VR是一个基于多智能体协作的视频修复系统，通过三个协调的智能体（退化识别、路由与修复、修复质量评估）模拟人类专家的处理流程，有效处理复杂多样的视频退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的视频常因采集和传输条件不同而遭受复杂退化（如噪声、压缩伪影、低光失真），现有方法需要人工选择专用模型或采用单一架构，难以泛化处理各种退化类型。

Method: 构建大规模高分辨率视频退化识别基准，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）驱动退化识别器；引入基于大语言模型（LLM）的自适应路由器，通过观察工具使用模式学习有效修复策略；构建Res-VQ数据集并设计专用VLM视频质量评估模型。

Result: 大量实验表明，MoA-VR能有效处理多样化和复合退化问题，在客观指标和感知质量方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了多模态智能和模块化推理在通用视频修复系统中的整合潜力。

Abstract: Real-world videos often suffer from complex degradations, such as noise,
compression artifacts, and low-light distortions, due to diverse acquisition
and transmission conditions. Existing restoration methods typically require
professional manual selection of specialized models or rely on monolithic
architectures that fail to generalize across varying degradations. Inspired by
expert experience, we propose MoA-VR, the first
\underline{M}ixture-\underline{o}f-\underline{A}gents \underline{V}ideo
\underline{R}estoration system that mimics the reasoning and processing
procedures of human professionals through three coordinated agents: Degradation
Identification, Routing and Restoration, and Restoration Quality Assessment.
Specifically, we construct a large-scale and high-resolution video degradation
recognition benchmark and build a vision-language model (VLM) driven
degradation identifier. We further introduce a self-adaptive router powered by
large language models (LLMs), which autonomously learns effective restoration
strategies by observing tool usage patterns. To assess intermediate and final
processed video quality, we construct the \underline{Res}tored
\underline{V}ideo \underline{Q}uality (Res-VQ) dataset and design a dedicated
VLM-based video quality assessment (VQA) model tailored for restoration tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoA-VR effectively handles diverse and
compound degradations, consistently outperforming existing baselines in terms
of both objective metrics and perceptual quality. These results highlight the
potential of integrating multimodal intelligence and modular reasoning in
general-purpose video restoration systems.

TL;DR: 该论文发现视觉变换器(ViT)中存在高范数视觉标记(ViT注意力汇)，这些标记包含图像的高级语义概念，对大型视觉语言模型的理解和推理至关重要。通过利用这些标记，可以显著提升视觉推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM中的注意力汇，但很少研究ViT中的高范数视觉标记。这些ViT注意力汇包含重要语义信息，但在现有LVLM架构中常被忽视，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出了定性和定量分析ViT注意力汇中信息的方法，并开发了免训练和基于训练的方法来更好地利用这些信息，让LLM更有效地解释这些标记。

Result: 通过显式利用ViT注意力汇，在多种LVLM和视觉推理任务上实现了显著改进，证明了这些标记在增强视觉推理方面的未开发潜力。

Conclusion: ViT注意力汇是LVLM中重要的视觉语义载体，有效利用这些标记可以显著提升模型的视觉理解和推理能力，为LVLM架构优化提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该框架在保持点云结构和语义完整性的同时实现了高效压缩，为带宽受限环境下的多机器人系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient transmission of 3D point cloud data is critical for advanced
perception in centralized and decentralized multi-agent robotic systems,
especially nowadays with the growing reliance on edge and cloud-based
processing. However, the large and complex nature of point clouds creates
challenges under bandwidth constraints and intermittent connectivity, often
degrading system performance. We propose a deep compression framework based on
semantic scene graphs. The method decomposes point clouds into semantically
coherent patches and encodes them into compact latent representations with
semantic-aware encoders conditioned by Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). A
folding-based decoder, guided by latent features and graph node attributes,
enables structurally accurate reconstruction. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets show that the framework achieves state-of-the-art
compression rates, reducing data size by up to 98% while preserving both
structural and semantic fidelity. In addition, it supports downstream
applications such as multi-robot pose graph optimization and map merging,
achieving trajectory accuracy and map alignment comparable to those obtained
with raw LiDAR scans.

Method: 提出了Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis理论框架，基于谱平衡和任务能量两个现象。开发了SliceFine方法，仅更新原始权重的选定切片，不引入新参数。

Result: SliceFine在语言和视觉任务上达到了最先进PEFT方法的性能，同时显著提高了训练速度、内存效率和模型紧凑性。

Conclusion: 该工作连接了理论与实践，为现有PEFT技术提供了理论基础的替代方案，证明了利用预训练模型固有冗余的有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small,
randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be
sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit
a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral
balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably
similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich,
task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis,
which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning
(PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT
method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices
of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based
approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art
PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving
training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges
theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing
PEFT techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法在轨迹控制方面存在局限性，需要更灵活、多粒度的轨迹控制能力，以支持各种应用场景如运动克隆、拖拽式视频生成等。

Method: 引入统一的点基运动表示（分割ID、轨迹ID、颜色通道），采用序列拼接方案而非token拼接或ControlNet，使用退火训练策略逐步减少对完整监督和对齐条件的依赖。

Result: 实验结果表明FlexTraj能够实现多粒度、对齐无关的轨迹控制，支持运动克隆、拖拽式图像到视频、运动插值、相机重定向、灵活动作控制和网格动画等多种应用。

Conclusion: FlexTraj提供了一个高效灵活的轨迹控制视频生成框架，在保持鲁棒性的同时实现了更强的可控性和更快的收敛速度。

Abstract: We present FlexTraj, a framework for image-to-video generation with flexible
point trajectory control. FlexTraj introduces a unified point-based motion
representation that encodes each point with a segmentation ID, a temporally
consistent trajectory ID, and an optional color channel for appearance cues,
enabling both dense and sparse trajectory control. Instead of injecting
trajectory conditions into the video generator through token concatenation or
ControlNet, FlexTraj employs an efficient sequence-concatenation scheme that
achieves faster convergence, stronger controllability, and more efficient
inference, while maintaining robustness under unaligned conditions. To train
such a unified point trajectory-controlled video generator, FlexTraj adopts an
annealing training strategy that gradually reduces reliance on complete
supervision and aligned condition. Experimental results demonstrate that
FlexTraj enables multi-granularity, alignment-agnostic trajectory control for
video generation, supporting various applications such as motion cloning,
drag-based image-to-video, motion interpolation, camera redirection, flexible
action control and mesh animations.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理方面存在根本性挑战，主要原因是缺乏从感知到理解的层次化基础。

Method: 构建SpatialLadder-26k多模态数据集，采用三阶段渐进训练框架：空间感知（目标定位）、空间理解（多维任务）、复杂推理（强化学习）。

Result: SpatialLadder模型在空间推理基准测试中达到最先进水平，平均提升23.4%，在领域外基准上保持强泛化能力（提升7.2%）。

Conclusion: 从感知到推理的渐进式训练对于构建鲁棒的空间智能至关重要。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a fundamental challenge for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), with current approaches struggling to achieve robust performance
despite recent advances. We identify that this limitation stems from a critical
gap: existing methods attempt to learn spatial reasoning directly without
establishing the hierarchical foundations of perception and understanding. To
address this challenge, we present a comprehensive methodology for building
spatial intelligence progressively. We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a
multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization,
single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed
through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across
modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive
training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object
localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional
spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning
with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter
model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning
benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing
GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%. Notably, SpatialLadder maintains
strong generalization with 7.2% improvement on out-of-domain benchmarks,
demonstrating that progressive training from perception to reasoning is
essential for robust spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing offers a powerful and intuitive way to
manipulate images through natural language. Yet, relying solely on text
instructions limits fine-grained control over the extent of edits. We introduce
Kontinuous Kontext, an instruction-driven editing model that provides a new
dimension of control over edit strength, enabling users to adjust edits
gradually from no change to a fully realized result in a smooth and continuous
manner. Kontinuous Kontext extends a state-of-the-art image editing model to
accept an additional input, a scalar edit strength which is then paired with
the edit instruction, enabling explicit control over the extent of the edit. To
inject this scalar information, we train a lightweight projector network that
maps the input scalar and the edit instruction to coefficients in the model's
modulation space. For training our model, we synthesize a diverse dataset of
image-edit-instruction-strength quadruplets using existing generative models,
followed by a filtering stage to ensure quality and consistency. Kontinuous
Kontext provides a unified approach for fine-grained control over edit strength
for instruction driven editing from subtle to strong across diverse operations
such as stylization, attribute, material, background, and shape changes,
without requiring attribute-specific training.

for long-chain reflective reasoning, a prerequisite for solving complex
real-world problems, remains largely underexplored. In this work, we first
conduct an extensive empirical investigation to evaluate this capability.
Leveraging a carefully designed data synthesis engine, we construct MM-HELIX, a
multimodal benchmark consisting 1,260 samples of 42 challenging synthetic tasks
that require iterative thinking and backtracking. Empirical results on this
benchmark reveal that existing MLLMs exhibit significant performance deficits
in long-chain reflective reasoning. To address this limitation, we generate
post-training data and further explore learning paradigms for exploiting such
data. We first develop the Step-Elicited Response Generation pipeline to create
MM-HELIX-100K, a large-scale dataset of 100k high-quality, reflective reasoning
traces for instruction-tuning stage. Given that standard Reinforcement Learning
fails on complex tasks due to sparse reward signals and catastrophic forgetting
after Supervised Fine-Tuning, we propose Adaptive Hybrid Policy Optimization
(AHPO), a novel training strategy that dynamically unifies offline supervision
and online optimization into a single stage. This strategy enables the model to
learn from expert data when rewards are sparse and conduct independent
exploration once proficient. When applied to the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline, our
method achieves a +18.6\% accuracy improvement on MM-HELIX benchmark and
demonstrates strong generalization with a +5.7\% average performance gain on
general mathematic and logic tasks. Our work demonstrate that reflective
reasoning in MLLMs can be effectively learned and generalized, paving the way
for developing more capable MLLMs.

*Nikhil Reddy Varimalla,Yunfei Xu,Arkadiy Saakyan,Meng Fan Wang,Smaranda Muresan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoNorms是一个包含1000多个视频片段-规范对的文化基准数据集，用于评估视频大语言模型的文化意识，重点关注中美文化差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视频大语言模型在全球部署，需要评估其对相关文化背景的理解和基础能力，但目前缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 采用人机协作框架构建数据集：使用基于理论提示的教师模型生成候选标注，训练有素的人类专家验证和修正标注。

Result: 基准测试显示：1)模型在规范违反检测上表现较差；2)对中国文化的理解不如美国文化；3)提供非语言证据比语言证据更困难；4)在正式、非幽默语境中表现不如人类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了文化基础视频语言模型训练的必要性，VideoNorms基准和框架开始填补这一空白。

Abstract: As Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are deployed globally, they
require understanding of and grounding in the relevant cultural background. To
properly assess these models' cultural awareness, adequate benchmarks are
needed. We introduce VideoNorms, a benchmark of over 1000 (video clip, norm)
pairs from US and Chinese cultures annotated with socio-cultural norms grounded
in speech act theory, norm adherence and violations labels, and verbal and
non-verbal evidence. To build VideoNorms, we use a human-AI collaboration
framework, where a teacher model using theoretically-grounded prompting
provides candidate annotations and a set of trained human experts validate and
correct the annotations. We benchmark a variety of open-weight VideoLLMs on the
new dataset which highlight several common trends: 1) models performs worse on
norm violation than adherence; 2) models perform worse w.r.t Chinese culture
compared to the US culture; 3) models have more difficulty in providing
non-verbal evidence compared to verbal for the norm adhere/violation label and
struggle to identify the exact norm corresponding to a speech-act; and 4)
unlike humans, models perform worse in formal, non-humorous contexts. Our
findings emphasize the need for culturally-grounded video language model
training - a gap our benchmark and framework begin to address.

TL;DR: ARTDECO是一个统一的3D重建框架，结合了前馈模型的高效性和SLAM管道的可靠性，通过3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，使用高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，实现交互式性能和高保真重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目图像序列实时3D重建的挑战，现有方法在计算效率和重建质量之间存在权衡：逐场景优化保真度高但计算昂贵，前馈基础模型实时但精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: 使用3D基础模型进行姿态估计和点预测，结合高斯解码器将多尺度特征转换为结构化3D高斯，设计分层高斯表示和LoD感知渲染策略以提高渲染保真度并减少冗余。

Result: 在8个不同的室内外基准测试中，ARTDECO实现了与SLAM相当的交互性能，与前馈系统相似的鲁棒性，以及接近逐场景优化的重建质量。

Conclusion: ARTDECO为实时数字化真实世界环境提供了一条实用路径，同时实现了准确的几何结构和高视觉保真度。

Abstract: On-the-fly 3D reconstruction from monocular image sequences is a
long-standing challenge in computer vision, critical for applications such as
real-to-sim, AR/VR, and robotics. Existing methods face a major tradeoff:
per-scene optimization yields high fidelity but is computationally expensive,
whereas feed-forward foundation models enable real-time inference but struggle
with accuracy and robustness. In this work, we propose ARTDECO, a unified
framework that combines the efficiency of feed-forward models with the
reliability of SLAM-based pipelines. ARTDECO uses 3D foundation models for pose
estimation and point prediction, coupled with a Gaussian decoder that
transforms multi-scale features into structured 3D Gaussians. To sustain both
fidelity and efficiency at scale, we design a hierarchical Gaussian
representation with a LoD-aware rendering strategy, which improves rendering
fidelity while reducing redundancy. Experiments on eight diverse indoor and
outdoor benchmarks show that ARTDECO delivers interactive performance
comparable to SLAM, robustness similar to feed-forward systems, and
reconstruction quality close to per-scene optimization, providing a practical
path toward on-the-fly digitization of real-world environments with both
accurate geometry and high visual fidelity. Explore more demos on our project

TL;DR: 提出了Memoir方法，通过基于想象力的检索机制选择性获取环境观察和行为历史，在记忆持久性视觉语言导航任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆持久性VLN方法存在关键限制：缺乏有效的内存访问机制，依赖完整内存整合或固定范围查找，且主要存储环境观察而忽略编码有价值决策策略的导航行为模式。

Method: 1) 语言条件世界模型想象未来状态作为查询；2) 混合视点级内存锚定观察和行为模式；3) 经验增强导航模型通过专用编码器整合检索知识。

Result: 在10个不同测试场景中全面评估，IR2R上SPL指标比最佳记忆持久性基线提升5.4%，训练速度提升8.3倍，推理内存减少74%。

Conclusion: 预测性检索环境和行为记忆能实现更有效的导航，想象力引导范式仍有巨大提升空间（73.3% vs 93.4%上限）。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural
language instructions through environments, with memory-persistent variants
demanding progressive improvement through accumulated experience. Existing
approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack
effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory
incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only
environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that
encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs
imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model
imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant
environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)
a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual
purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)
Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral
patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an
experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge
through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse
memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios
demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all
scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent
baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory
reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental
and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis
indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this
imagination-guided paradigm. Code at https://github.com/xyz9911/Memoir.

TL;DR: VideoCanvas提出了任意时空视频补全任务，通过零参数修改实现像素级精确控制，解决了因果VAE的时间模糊性问题，统一了多种可控视频生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在视频扩散模型存在时间模糊性问题，因果VAE将多个像素帧压缩到单一潜在表示中，难以实现精确的帧级控制。需要一种灵活统一的范式来处理任意时空条件下的视频生成。

Method: 采用混合条件策略：空间控制通过零填充处理，时间对齐通过时间RoPE插值实现，为每个条件分配连续的分数位置。基于In-Context Conditioning范式，无需新参数。

Result: 在VideoCanvasBench基准测试中表现优异，在场景内保真度和场景间创造力方面显著优于现有条件范式，建立了灵活统一视频生成的新SOTA。

Conclusion: VideoCanvas成功解决了因果VAE的时间模糊性问题，实现了像素级精确控制，为任意时空视频补全任务提供了统一有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the task of arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, where a
video is generated from arbitrary, user-specified patches placed at any spatial
location and timestamp, akin to painting on a video canvas. This flexible
formulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation
tasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and
interpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,
however, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:
the temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames
are compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level
conditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with
VideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)
paradigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose
a hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:
spatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is
achieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a
continuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the
VAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen
backbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the
first benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both
intra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity. Experiments demonstrate that
VideoCanvas significantly outperforms existing conditioning paradigms,
establishing a new state of the art in flexible and unified video generation.

Method: 开发SciVideoBench基准，包含1000个精心设计的多选题，源自前沿科学实验视频，通过半自动系统验证，要求领域专业知识、精确时空感知和复杂逻辑推理。

Result: 评估显示最先进的专有和开源LMMs（包括Gemini 2.5 Pro和Qwen2.5-VL）存在显著性能缺陷，表明视频推理能力有大幅提升空间。

Conclusion: SciVideoBench为LMMs的未来发展提供了宝贵见解和明确方向，推动真正有能力的多模态AI共同科学家的演进。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress across
various capabilities; however, complex video reasoning in the scientific domain
remains a significant and challenging frontier. Current video benchmarks
predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily
relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation
and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills.
To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark
specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific
contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice
questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning
over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system.
Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise
spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively
challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights
significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating
substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed
analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding
provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs,
driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists. We hope
SciVideoBench could fit the interests of the community and help to push the
boundary of cutting-edge AI for border science.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频插帧方法无法生成复杂运动，缺乏用户意图的多样性和对中间帧细节的精细控制，无法满足创意需求。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)架构，将运动控制映射为基于点的表示，分离内容和运动控制为两个分支，采用分阶段训练策略。

Result: 定性和定量实验表明，多模态控制能够实现更动态、可定制和上下文准确的视觉叙事。

Conclusion: 该框架在灵活性、易用性和精度之间取得了平衡，为视频插帧提供了更强大的控制能力。

Abstract: Video inbetweening creates smooth and natural transitions between two image
frames, making it an indispensable tool for video editing and long-form video
synthesis. Existing works in this domain are unable to generate large, complex,
or intricate motions. In particular, they cannot accommodate the versatility of
user intents and generally lack fine control over the details of intermediate
frames, leading to misalignment with the creative mind. To fill these gaps, we
introduce \modelname{}, a video inbetweening framework that allows multi-modal
controls, including depth transition and layering, motion trajectories, text
prompts, and target regions for movement localization, while achieving a
balance between flexibility, ease of use, and precision for fine-grained video
interpolation. To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)
architecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to
generate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our
multi-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and
user-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to
respect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity
and influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two
branches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,
resulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content. Finally,
we propose a stage-wise training strategy to ensure that our model learns the
multi-modal controls smoothly. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments demonstrate that multi-modal controls enable a more dynamic,
customizable, and contextually accurate visual narrative.

TL;DR: ResAD提出了一种归一化残差轨迹建模框架，通过预测与确定性惯性参考的偏差来解决端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，显著简化学习任务并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶系统面临轨迹数据固有的时空不平衡问题，这导致模型学习虚假相关性而非因果推理，同时优先处理不确定的远距离预测而损害即时安全性。

Method: 提出ResAD框架：1）预测与确定性惯性参考的残差偏差而非直接预测未来轨迹；2）采用逐点归一化对预测残差进行重新加权，防止远距离不确定路径点的大误差主导学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，ResAD使用仅有两个去噪步骤的普通扩散策略实现了88.6的最优PDMS分数，表明该方法显著简化学习任务并提升模型性能。

Conclusion: ResAD通过残差轨迹建模和归一化处理，有效解决了端到端自动驾驶中的时空不平衡问题，为因果推理提供了更好的学习框架。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future
trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the
inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a
significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations
instead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant
predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we
propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.
Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the
learning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial
reference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model
to move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying
causal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations
from a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance
caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise
Normalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization
objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain
waypoints from dominating the learning signal. Extensive experiments validate
the effectiveness of our framework. On the NAVSIM benchmark, ResAD achieves a
state-of-the-art PDMS of 88.6 using a vanilla diffusion policy with only two
denoising steps, demonstrating that our approach significantly simplifies the
learning task and improves model performance. The code will be released to
facilitate further research.

Method: 系统研究MLLMs的各种设计选择，获得最佳元架构平衡性能与训练成本；探索原生MLLM的扩展特性，发现视觉编码器与LLMs的正相关扩展关系；基于发现提出NaViL模型及简单有效的训练方法。

Result: 在14个多模态基准测试中，NaViL展现出与现有MLLMs竞争的性能，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为原生MLLMs的未来研究提供了深入见解，证明了端到端训练范式在多模态扩展方面的优势。

Abstract: Compositional training has been the de-facto paradigm in existing Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs), where pre-trained vision encoders are connected
with pre-trained LLMs through continuous multimodal pre-training. However, the
multimodal scaling property of this paradigm remains difficult to explore due
to the separated training. In this paper, we focus on the native training of
MLLMs in an end-to-end manner and systematically study its design space and
scaling property under a practical setting, i.e., data constraint. Through
careful study of various choices in MLLM, we obtain the optimal
meta-architecture that best balances performance and training cost. After that,
we further explore the scaling properties of the native MLLM and indicate the
positively correlated scaling relationship between visual encoders and LLMs.
Based on these findings, we propose a native MLLM called NaViL, combined with a
simple and cost-effective recipe. Experimental results on 14 multimodal
benchmarks confirm the competitive performance of NaViL against existing MLLMs.
Besides that, our findings and results provide in-depth insights for the future
study of native MLLMs.

Conclusion: D²GS框架有效解决了稀疏视图下3D高斯泼溅的过拟合和欠拟合问题，提升了重建质量和稳定性

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enable real-time,
high-fidelity novel view synthesis (NVS) with explicit 3D representations.
However, performance degradation and instability remain significant under
sparse-view conditions. In this work, we identify two key failure modes under
sparse-view conditions: overfitting in regions with excessive Gaussian density
near the camera, and underfitting in distant areas with insufficient Gaussian
coverage. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework D$^2$GS,
comprising two key components: a Depth-and-Density Guided Dropout strategy that
suppresses overfitting by adaptively masking redundant Gaussians based on
density and depth, and a Distance-Aware Fidelity Enhancement module that
improves reconstruction quality in under-fitted far-field areas through
targeted supervision. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation metric to
quantify the stability of learned Gaussian distributions, providing insights
into the robustness of the sparse-view 3DGS. Extensive experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both visual quality
and robustness under sparse view conditions. The project page can be found at:

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are increasingly deployed as controllers with
access to external tools for complex reasoning and decision-making, yet their
effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal
trajectories and the cost of manual annotation. We address this challenge with
a vision-centric agent tuning framework that automatically synthesizes
multimodal trajectories, generates step-wise preference pairs, and trains a VLM
controller for robust tool-use reasoning. Our pipeline first constructs
M-TRACE, a large-scale dataset of 28.5K multimodal tasks with 177K verified
trajectories, enabling imitation-based trajectory tuning. Building on this, we
develop MATRIX Agent, a controller finetuned on M-TRACE for step-wise tool
reasoning. To achieve finer alignment, we further introduce Pref-X, a set of
11K automatically generated preference pairs, and optimize MATRIX on it via
step-wise preference learning. Across three benchmarks, Agent-X, GTA, and GAIA,
MATRIX consistently surpasses both open- and closed-source VLMs, demonstrating

Conclusion: ReSplat通过循环反馈机制有效提升了高斯泼溅模型的性能，实现了更好的泛化能力和计算效率。

Abstract: While feed-forward Gaussian splatting models provide computational efficiency
and effectively handle sparse input settings, their performance is
fundamentally limited by the reliance on a single forward pass during
inference. We propose ReSplat, a feed-forward recurrent Gaussian splatting
model that iteratively refines 3D Gaussians without explicitly computing
gradients. Our key insight is that the Gaussian splatting rendering error
serves as a rich feedback signal, guiding the recurrent network to learn
effective Gaussian updates. This feedback signal naturally adapts to unseen
data distributions at test time, enabling robust generalization. To initialize
the recurrent process, we introduce a compact reconstruction model that
operates in a $16 \times$ subsampled space, producing $16 \times$ fewer
Gaussians than previous per-pixel Gaussian models. This substantially reduces
computational overhead and allows for efficient Gaussian updates. Extensive
experiments across varying of input views (2, 8, 16), resolutions ($256 \times
256$ to $540 \times 960$), and datasets (DL3DV and RealEstate10K) demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly
reducing the number of Gaussians and improving the rendering speed. Our project

Abstract: The ascension of social media platforms has transformed our understanding of
urban environments, giving rise to nuanced variations in sentiment reaction
embedded within human perception and opinion, and challenging existing
multidimensional sentiment analysis approaches in urban studies. This study
presents novel methodologies for identifying and elucidating sentiment
inconsistency, constructing a dataset encompassing 140,750 Baidu and Tencent
Street view images to measure perceptions, and 984,024 Weibo social media text
posts to measure opinions. A reaction index is developed, integrating object
detection and natural language processing techniques to classify sentiment in
Beijing Second Ring for 2016 and 2022. Classified sentiment reaction is
analysed and visualized using regression analysis, image segmentation, and word
frequency based on land-use distribution to discern underlying factors. The
perception affective reaction trend map reveals a shift toward more evenly
distributed positive sentiment, while the opinion affective reaction trend map
shows more extreme changes. Our mismatch map indicates significant disparities
between the sentiments of human perception and opinion of urban areas over the
years. Changes in sentiment reactions have significant relationships with
elements such as dense buildings and pedestrian presence. Our inconsistent maps
present perception and opinion sentiments before and after the pandemic and
offer potential explanations and directions for environmental management, in
formulating strategies for urban renewal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了HaystackCraft基准测试，通过构建包含异构检索策略和智能体工作流程噪声的长上下文环境，评估大语言模型在真实场景下的长上下文鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的"大海捞针"基准测试过于理想化，忽略了现实世界中由有偏检索和智能体工作流程产生的噪声上下文问题，需要构建更真实的测试环境。

Method: 基于英文维基百科超链接网络构建HaystackCraft基准，包含多跳问题，评估不同检索策略（稀疏、稠密、混合、图基）对干扰项组成和排序的影响，并扩展到动态智能体操作场景。

Result: 实验表明：1）更强的稠密检索器会引入更具挑战性的干扰项，但图基重排序能同时提高检索效果并减轻有害干扰；2）在智能体测试中，即使先进模型也会因自生成干扰项而产生级联失败或难以提前停止。

Conclusion: 智能体长上下文推理仍面临持续挑战，HaystackCraft为未来进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic
"needle-in-a-haystack" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy
contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that
haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that
faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous
biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models'
long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH
benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop
questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies
(e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition,
haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further
extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic
operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and
decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1)
while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors,
graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and
mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models
like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated
distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight
persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish
HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.

*Olia Toporkov,Alan Akbik,Rodrigo Agerri*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文实证研究大型语言模型在上下文词形还原任务中的表现，与传统监督方法比较，发现在多数语言中LLMs无需微调即可达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在多种NLP任务中表现出色，但尚无证据表明其在上下文词形还原任务中的有效性，特别是在目标领域或语言缺乏训练数据的情况下。

Method: 比较(i)域外微调的编码器监督方法，(ii)跨语言方法，与(iii)LLMs直接上下文生成词形的方法，在12种不同形态复杂度的语言上进行实验。

Result: 编码器在域外设置中仍具竞争力，但当前LLMs在多数语言中通过少量示例直接生成词形即可达到最先进结果，无需微调。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文词形还原任务中表现出色，特别是在缺乏训练数据的情况下，通过少量示例即可达到优异性能。

Abstract: Lemmatization is the task of transforming all words in a given text to their
dictionary forms. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their
ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there
is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization
task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest
generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the
traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting
in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or
language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned
out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma
generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of
different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain
competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current
LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating
lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

*Amruta Parulekar,Preethi Jyothi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出LASER评分系统，利用LLM的上下文学习能力评估ASR输出，解决传统WER指标对形态和句法细微差异过度惩罚的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ASR评估指标如词错误率(WER)对不影响句子语义的形态和句法细微差异进行不公平的惩罚，需要更智能的评估方法。

Method: 使用最先进LLM的上下文学习能力，通过包含详细示例的提示来学习评分规则；同时展示如何用更小的LLM在词对示例上进行微调来预测惩罚类型。

Result: Hindi LASER使用Gemini 2.5 Pro获得与人工标注94%的高相关性；Hindi示例对其他印度语言如Marathi、Kannada和Malayalam的错误分析也有效；小LLM微调后预测惩罚类型准确率达89%。

Conclusion: LLM-based LASER评分系统能有效评估ASR输出，解决传统指标的局限性，并在多语言场景中展现良好泛化能力。

Abstract: Standard ASR evaluation metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) tend to unfairly
penalize morphological and syntactic nuances that do not significantly alter
sentence semantics. We introduce an LLM-based scoring rubric LASER that
leverages state-of-the-art LLMs' in-context learning abilities to learn from
prompts with detailed examples. Hindi LASER scores using Gemini 2.5 Pro
achieved a very high correlation score of 94% with human annotations. Hindi
examples in the prompt were also effective in analyzing errors in other Indian
languages such as Marathi, Kannada and Malayalam. We also demonstrate how a
smaller LLM like Llama 3 can be finetuned on word-pair examples derived from
reference and ASR predictions to predict what kind of penalty should be applied
with close to 89% accuracy.

distance-based, embedding-based, and back-translation-based metrics. We show
tradeoffs between different metrics in different scenarios through automatic

TL;DR: 使用基于规则和锚点的链式思维提示方法，让大型语言模型能够准确测量民粹主义的思想内容，达到与人类专家编码者相当的分类准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于文本分析的民粹主义测量方法成本高、耗时长，难以跨语言、跨语境和大规模语料库扩展，需要更高效准确的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用规则和锚点引导的链式思维提示方法，利用全球民粹主义数据库(GPD)训练LLM，模拟人类编码者的训练过程，测试多种专有和开源模型。

Result: 这种领域特定的提示策略使LLM在民粹主义分类上达到与专家人类编码者相当的准确度，能够处理民粹主义的细微和语境敏感特征。

Conclusion: 基于规则和锚点的链式思维提示方法为测量民粹主义思想内容提供了一种高效、可扩展的自动化解决方案，性能可与人类专家相媲美。

Abstract: Measuring the ideational content of populism remains a challenge. Traditional
strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the
field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist
framing. Yet these approaches are costly, time consuming, and difficult to
scale across languages, contexts, and large corpora. Here we present the
results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting
approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism
Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated
for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by
prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide
the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models
by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific
prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par
with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced,
context sensitive aspects of populism.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPRO是一个多智能体提示优化框架，通过最大后验推理和拓扑感知的细化机制，自动优化多智能体系统中的提示设计，显著提升系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统虽然能超越单智能体，但由于提示敏感性和系统不稳定性，设计有效的多智能体系统仍然困难。现有的自动提示设计方法主要针对单智能体，多智能体提示优化尚未充分探索。

Method: MAPRO将多智能体提示优化建模为最大后验推理问题，使用语言引导的最大乘积置信传播算法求解。采用拓扑感知细化机制，整合执行反馈和下游责任来选择性更新智能体提示。

Result: 在多个任务的基准测试中，MAPRO实现了最先进的性能，始终超越手动设计的基线和最近的自动替代方案。

Conclusion: MAPRO不仅提升了多智能体系统的性能，其基于最大后验的公式化为构建更可靠、有原则的多智能体系统提供了通用指导方针。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various
practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS)
can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing
effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded
instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in
automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt
optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially
expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic
design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce
M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first
formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference
problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief
propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system
iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that
integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent
prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated
set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks,
MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually
engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our
MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more
reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future

*Shuqing Luo,Yilin Guan,Pingzhi Li,Hanrui Wang,Tianlong Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AsyncSpade是一个异步框架，通过预测查询状态和分离KV缓存过滤，在测试时缩放任务中显著提升LLM推理效率，减少时间开销同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询感知的稀疏解码方法在测试时缩放任务中面临顺序依赖和粗粒度令牌选择的限制，导致在高并发和长思维链场景下服务效率低下。

Method: 提出AsyncSpade框架，包含轻量级时序回归模块预测查询状态，以及异步解耦框架将KV缓存过滤与自回归解码循环分离。

Result: 在A100节点上，AsyncSpade完全重叠KV缓存操作与推理流水线，实现理论最优TPOT，相比SoTA基线减少20%以上TPOT，相比全注意力减少至少50%TPOT。

Conclusion: AsyncSpade首次在不牺牲模型性能的情况下消除了顺序依赖，在各种TTS基准测试中匹配或超越现有方法的准确性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT),
but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM
decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art
performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both
sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection,
hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high
concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the
forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step
query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short
window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without
waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework
for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight
temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an
asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering
from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV
selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our
knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence
without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of
AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade
fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving
theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade
delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and
at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and
Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS
benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多智能体框架来探索团队科学的核心方面：结构、多样性和互动动态，评估了在常识推理和社交推理任务上的团队表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于大语言模型的多智能体系统受到关注，但对其团队动态的研究较少，受人类团队科学启发，旨在探索智能体团队的核心特征。

Method: 提出了一个多智能体框架，评估团队在四个任务（CommonsenseQA、StrategyQA、Social IQa、Latent Implicit Hate）上的表现，涵盖常识推理和社交推理。

Result: 扁平化团队表现优于层级化团队，多样性影响复杂；智能体对团队表现过度自信，但任务后反思显示对协作的认可和整合挑战，包括有限的对话协调。

Conclusion: 多智能体团队在结构、多样性和互动方面表现出复杂动态，扁平结构更有效，但存在整合和协调挑战，为未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents are
gaining attention, yet fewer studies explore their team dynamics. Inspired by
human team science, we propose a multi-agent framework to examine core aspects
of team science: structure, diversity, and interaction dynamics. We evaluate
team performance across four tasks: CommonsenseQA, StrategyQA, Social IQa, and
Latent Implicit Hate, spanning commonsense and social reasoning. Our results
show that flat teams tend to perform better than hierarchical ones, while
diversity has a nuanced impact. Interviews suggest agents are overconfident
about their team performance, yet post-task reflections reveal both
appreciation for collaboration and challenges in integration, including limited
conversational coordination.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了思维链微调对多流语音大语言模型的影响，提出通过提前推理和基于熵的指标来优化语音代理的准确性和延迟平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音大语言模型在处理复杂推理任务时仍存在困难，而文本LLMs通过思维链技术显著提升了推理能力。同时，语音交互中响应延迟是关键因素，需要优化准确性与延迟的权衡。

Method: 采用思维链微调方法，引入基于熵的"问题完整性"指标来指导模型在用户查询结束前开始推理，并使用直接偏好优化进一步优化准确性与延迟的帕累托前沿。

Result: 思维链微调使语音LLMs在口语推理任务上的准确性平均提升2.4倍；提前推理方法在同等延迟条件下在ARC-Easy上获得4%准确性提升；DPO优化使延迟减少70%且准确性无损失。

Conclusion: 思维链微调能显著提升语音LLMs的推理能力，结合提前推理和DPO优化可有效平衡准确性与延迟，为语音代理系统提供了实用的优化方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in speech large language models (speech LLMs) have enabled
seamless spoken interactions, but these systems still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks. Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning
has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of
text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for
multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves
the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken
reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a
crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human
behavior of "thinking while listening," we propose methods to reduce the
additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning
before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based
metric, "question completeness," which acts as an indicator to guide the model
on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control
over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches
and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on
ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference
data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto
frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in
accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL)框架，通过可重用的思维模板来指导长上下文语言模型进行多跳推理，解决了简单增加文档数量无法有效连接证据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然长上下文语言模型能处理大量令牌，但仅将更多文档输入上下文窗口无法有效捕捉证据之间的连接方式，需要结构化方法来指导多跳推理。

Method: 使用思维模板将推理重新构建为可重用的思维缓存，这些模板源自先前的解题轨迹，结构化证据组合方式并通过自然语言反馈迭代优化模板。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和不同LCLM家族中，该方法相比强基线在基于检索和无检索设置下均取得一致增益，优化后的模板可蒸馏到更小的开源模型中。

Conclusion: ToTAL框架展示了广泛适用性和透明推理重用的潜力，通过思维模板有效提升了长上下文语言模型在多跳推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Recent Long-Context Language Models (LCLMs) can process hundreds of thousands
of tokens in a single prompt, enabling new opportunities for
knowledge-intensive multi-hop reasoning by integrating large sets of retrieved
documents or, in some cases, directly all necessary information. However,
simply feeding more documents into the context window fails to capture how
evidence should be connected. We address this gap with thought templates, which
recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving
traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference
with factual documents. To keep these templates effective, we propose an update
strategy that iteratively refines templates derived from training data through
natural-language feedback. Across diverse benchmarks and LCLM families, our
approach delivers consistent gains over strong baselines in both
retrieval-based and retrieval-free settings. Furthermore, we show that
optimized templates can be distilled into smaller open-source models,
demonstrating its broad applicability and transparent reasoning reuse. We refer
to our framework as Thought Template Augmented LCLMs (ToTAL).

Motivation: 波斯语使用两种书写标准（波斯-阿拉伯字母和塔吉克-西里尔字母），阻碍了塔吉克斯坦与其他波斯语国家的书面交流。现有模型局限于特定领域，缺乏实际应用的通用性

Method: 开发了序列到序列模型，在所有可用数据集上进行训练，并提供了两个新的数据集

Result: 模型在Farsi到Tajik方向获得chrF++ 87.91和Normalized CER 0.05，Tajik到Farsi方向获得chrF++ 92.28和Normalized CER 0.04

Conclusion: 该模型为波斯语-塔吉克语音译任务提供了清晰的性能基准，解决了跨域音译的挑战，模型、数据和代码均已公开

Abstract: As a digraphic language, the Persian language utilizes two written standards:
Perso-Arabic in Afghanistan and Iran, and Tajik-Cyrillic in Tajikistan. Despite
the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script
differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication
and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To
overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine
transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most
efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these
models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly
usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains,
meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage.
The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty.
We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi
transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets
of our own. Our results across domains provide clearer understanding of the
task, and set comprehensive comparable leading benchmarks. Overall, our model
achieves chrF++ and Normalized CER scores of 87.91 and 0.05 from Farsi to Tajik
and 92.28 and 0.04 from Tajik to Farsi. Our model, data, and code are available

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OWL的新模型，通过LSTM-based drafter、特殊token [SPEC]和混合解码算法，在长上下文场景下实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，解决了现有推测解码方法在长上下文中的性能退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码方法在短上下文（如2K tokens）基准上表现良好，但在实际工作负载中的长上下文场景下性能严重退化，甚至导致生成速度下降。

Method: 1) 基于LSTM的drafter，仅依赖于最后一个token状态，使其能够泛化到各种长度；2) 验证器中使用特殊token [SPEC]为drafter生成更丰富的表示；3) 结合树和非树解码方法的混合算法。

Result: OWL在长上下文输入上实现了比EAGLE3高约5倍的接受长度，解决了长上下文下的性能退化问题。

Conclusion: 通过LongSpecBench基准和OWL模型，成功解决了推测解码在长上下文场景中的局限性，为未来研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Speculative decoding promises faster inference for large language models
(LLMs), yet existing methods fail to generalize to real-world settings.
Benchmarks typically assume short contexts (e.g., 2K tokens), whereas practical
workloads involve long contexts. We find current approaches degrade severely
with long contexts; for instance, EAGLE3 even slows down the generation speed
by 0.81x. We address these limitations by releasing a new long-context
benchmark (LongSpecBench) and introducing a novel model (OWL). OWL achieves
about 5x higher acceptance length than EAGLE3 on long-context inputs through
three innovations: (1) an LSTM-based drafter conditioned only on the last-token
state, making it generalize to various lengths, (2) a special token [SPEC] in
the verifier that produces richer representation for drafter, and (3) a hybrid
algorithm combining both tree and non-tree decoding methods. We release all
code and datasets to advance future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决小参数模型（≤2B）在图表理解任务中作为自动评估器性能较差的问题，使其能在资源受限环境中实际应用。

Method: 使用多标准提示将多个评估标准合并到单个查询中，并通过领域自适应迁移学习在图表数据集上微调2B参数LVLM，创建ChartJudge模型。

Result: 多标准提示暴露了7B模型的鲁棒性差距，导致性能大幅下降；ChartJudge能够有效跨数据集迁移知识，成为更专业的模型。

Conclusion: 通过模型大小、提示设计和可迁移性之间的权衡分析，为图表推理任务提供了可扩展、低成本的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) with only 7B parameters have shown
promise as automated judges in chart comprehension tasks. However, tiny models
(<=2B parameters) still perform poorly as judges, limiting their real-world use
in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose two approaches to
ensure cost-efficient evaluation: (i) multi-criteria prompting, which combines
separate evaluation criteria into a single query, and (ii) domain-adaptive
transfer learning, in which we fine-tune a 2B-parameter LVLM on synthetic
judgments in a chart dataset to create the ChartJudge. Experiments show that
multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in
performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic.
In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer
knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model. Our
fine-grained analysis across chart types and query complexities offers
actionable insights into trade-offs between model size, prompt design, and
transferability, enabling scalable, low-cost evaluation for chart reasoning
tasks. Our code and the data will be made publicly available.

to enhance the adaptability of lightweight BERT-like encoders for two
fundamental NLP task families: named entity recognition (NER) and text

task family individually, we find that na\"ive multi-task pre-finetuning
introduces conflicting optimization signals that degrade overall performance.
To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task pre-finetuning
framework based on task-primary LoRA modules, which enables a single shared
encoder backbone with modular adapters. Our approach achieves performance
comparable to individual pre-finetuning while meeting practical deployment
constraint. Experiments on 21 downstream tasks show average improvements of
+0.8% for NER and +8.8% for text classification, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method for versatile mobile NLP applications.

### [119] [Linguistic Patterns in Pandemic-Related Content: A Comparative Analysis of COVID-19, Constraint, and Monkeypox Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07579)
*Mkululi Sikosana,Sean Maudsley-Barton,Oluwaseun Ajao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过计算语言学分析疫情相关网络话语，发现健康错误信息在可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用上与事实性内容存在显著差异。COVID-19错误信息可读性更低，恐惧相关词汇和说服性词汇使用频率是其他数据集的两倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在识别健康错误信息与事实性沟通在语言特征上的差异，为数字健康错误信息的检测提供语言学指标，并指导公共卫生信息传播策略。

Method: 使用三个语料库进行对比分析：COVID-19错误叙述（7588条）、一般COVID-19内容（10700条）和猴痘相关帖子（5787条），分析可读性、修辞标记和说服性语言使用。

Result: COVID-19错误信息表现出显著较低的可读性分数，恐惧相关或说服性词汇频率是其他数据集的两倍以上，感叹号使用极少，与猴痘内容的情绪化风格形成对比。

Conclusion: 错误信息采用刻意复杂的修辞风格并嵌入情感线索，这种组合可能增强其感知可信度。研究为数字健康错误信息检测提供了语言学指标，但也存在使用传统可读性指数、狭窄说服性词典等局限性。

Abstract: This study conducts a computational linguistic analysis of pandemic-related
online discourse to examine how language distinguishes health misinformation
from factual communication. Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives
(n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts
(n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical
markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited
markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of
fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed
minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of
Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a
deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a
combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute
to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting
linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public
health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in
networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges
limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a
deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate
analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs,
broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen
robustness.

*Chihiro Taguchi,Richard Sproat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用LLMs作为辅助工具开发构造语言的系统，通过模块化流程创建音系、翻译句子、构建词典、设计正字法，并生成语法手册


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双重目标：为构造语言创作提供有趣工具；探索LLMs对语言和语言学概念的理解程度

Method: 模块化方法：1) 代理式音系创建 2) 句子翻译为形态句法标记 3) 从语料库构建词典 4) 设计正字法 5) 编写语法手册

Result: 不同LLM和语言规范之间存在能力差异，处理常见模式比罕见模式更容易；在低资源语言翻译任务中结果大多为负面，但改进版本可能有潜力

Conclusion: 该系统为构造语言创作提供了实用工具，同时揭示了LLMs在语言理解方面的局限性，特别是在处理罕见语言模式时的挑战

Abstract: We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of
Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target
phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at
each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of
sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic
markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications
of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic
feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using
the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted
from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an
orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or
Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the
language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target
language.
  Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for
creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in
exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any
particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and
understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly
wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different
linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal
with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore
is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into
low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we
provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could
afford some real gains in such tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究分析了语言模型输入词汇表示的结构及其在训练过程中的演变，发现词汇嵌入几何快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关，高频词和功能词比低频词收敛更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型输入词汇表示的结构如何形成，以及这种结构在训练过程中如何演变，特别是词汇嵌入几何与语言特征的关系。

Method: 使用表征相似性分析，对Pythia 12B和OLMo 7B两个开源模型的输入和输出嵌入进行几何结构分析，关联语义、句法和频率指标。

Result: 1) 词汇嵌入几何在训练中快速收敛到与语义和句法特征高度相关；2) 高频词和功能词比词汇词和低频词收敛更快，后者保留随机初始化的偏差。

Conclusion: 揭示了词汇几何围绕语言结构组织的动态轨迹，显示了词频和功能词的不同作用，为研究词汇几何演变如何促进模型能力提升提供了动机。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) work by manipulating the geometry of input
embedding vectors over multiple layers. Here, we ask: how are the input
vocabulary representations of language models structured, and how and when does
this structure evolve over training? To answer this question, we use
representational similarity analysis, running a suite of experiments that
correlate the geometric structure of the input embeddings and output embeddings
of two open-source models (Pythia 12B and OLMo 7B) with semantic, syntactic,
and frequency-based metrics over the course of training. Our key findings are
as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly
converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features;
2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., "the," "of") converge
to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which
retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These
findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize
around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and
function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of
vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model
training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了LLM在临床编码任务中的失败原因，发现层次结构接近但错误的预测占很大比例。通过轻量级干预和引入临床编码验证任务，显著提高了编码准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的临床编码对医疗文档、计费和决策至关重要。现有LLM在此任务上表现不佳，且基于精确匹配的评估方法无法捕捉层次结构接近但错误的预测问题。

Method: 采用轻量级干预（提示工程和小规模微调）改进准确性，引入临床编码验证作为独立任务和流水线组件，并发布专家双重标注的门诊临床笔记基准数据集。

Result: 验证被证明是提高基于LLM的医疗编码的有效且可靠步骤，能够显著减少层次结构接近但错误的预测错误。

Conclusion: 临床编码验证是改进LLM医疗编码性能的关键方法，轻量级干预和专门的验证任务能够在不增加计算开销的情况下显著提升编码准确性。

Abstract: Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing,
and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle
with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors
where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis
reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion
of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt
engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the
computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically
near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone
task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing
datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release
an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10
codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step
toward improving LLM-based medical coding.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM在访问控制策略下的角色条件拒绝能力，通过扩展Spider和BIRD数据集添加PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种方法：提示、两步验证管道和LoRA微调，发现显式验证能提高拒绝精度，微调在安全性和实用性间取得更好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生不受限制的响应，模糊了角色边界，需要研究LLM在访问控制策略下正确拒绝未授权请求的能力。

Method: 创建了基于Spider和BIRD数据集的新数据集，添加了表级和列级的PostgreSQL角色策略，比较了三种方法：零/少样本提示、两步生成器-验证器管道、LoRA微调模型。

Result: 显式验证（两步框架）提高了拒绝精度并降低了错误许可，微调在安全性和实用性（执行准确性）之间取得了更好的平衡，更长更复杂的策略会降低所有系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: 显式验证和微调都能改善LLM的访问控制能力，但复杂策略仍然是挑战，发布了RBAC增强的数据集和代码。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of secure computing, yet large language
models often blur role boundaries by producing unrestricted responses. We study
role-conditioned refusals, focusing on the LLM's ability to adhere to access
control policies by answering when authorized and refusing when not. To
evaluate this behavior, we created a novel dataset that extends the Spider and
BIRD text-to-SQL datasets, both of which have been modified with realistic
PostgreSQL role-based policies at the table and column levels. We compare three
designs: (i) zero or few-shot prompting, (ii) a two-step generator-verifier
pipeline that checks SQL against policy, and (iii) LoRA fine-tuned models that
learn permission awareness directly. Across multiple model families, explicit
verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers
false permits. At the same time, fine-tuning achieves a stronger balance
between safety and utility (i.e., when considering execution accuracy). Longer
and more complex policies consistently reduce the reliability of all systems.
We release RBAC-augmented datasets and code.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统银行助手仅限于咨询或支持角色，需要开发一个能够作为主要银行界面并执行核心金融交易的对话式AI系统。

Method: 使用内部开发的闭源LLM ILMU，通过四个LLM驱动的代理（护栏、意图、支付、FAQ）协调对话，每个代理使用任务特定的LoRA适配器，在银行基础设施内托管以确保一致性。

Result: 成功实现了监管机构批准的自然语言界面，能够在严格治理下可靠支持核心金融操作。

Conclusion: Ryt AI证明了在严格监管下，自然语言界面可以可靠地支持核心金融操作，代表了银行服务的新范式。

Abstract: This paper presents Ryt AI, an LLM-native agentic framework that powers Ryt
Bank to enable customers to execute core financial transactions through natural
language conversation. This represents the first global regulator-approved
deployment worldwide where conversational AI functions as the primary banking
interface, in contrast to prior assistants that have been limited to advisory
or support roles. Built entirely in-house, Ryt AI is powered by ILMU, a
closed-source LLM developed internally, and replaces rigid multi-screen
workflows with a single dialogue orchestrated by four LLM-powered agents
(Guardrails, Intent, Payment, and FAQ). Each agent attaches a task-specific
LoRA adapter to ILMU, which is hosted within the bank's infrastructure to
ensure consistent behavior with minimal overhead. Deterministic guardrails,
human-in-the-loop confirmation, and a stateless audit architecture provide
defense-in-depth for security and compliance. The result is Banking Done Right:
demonstrating that regulator-approved natural-language interfaces can reliably
support core financial operations under strict governance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OBCache是一个基于最优脑损伤理论的KV缓存淘汰框架，将缓存淘汰建模为结构化剪枝问题，通过量化token对注意力输出的影响来优化现有淘汰策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的长上下文窗口导致KV缓存内存开销巨大，现有基于注意力权重的启发式淘汰方法未考虑token对注意力输出的真实影响。

Method: 基于OBD理论，OBCache通过闭式解量化剪枝token引起的注意力输出扰动，为孤立key、孤立value和联合key-value对提供显著性评分，包含注意力权重、value状态和注意力输出信息。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型上的实验表明，用OBCache的输出感知评分替换现有工作的启发式评分，能持续提升长上下文准确性。

Conclusion: OBCache提供了一个原则性的缓存淘汰框架，通过输出感知的显著性评分有效优化KV缓存管理，提升长上下文性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows enable powerful
downstream applications but impose significant memory overhead, as caching all
key-value (KV) states scales linearly with sequence length and batch size.
Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity,
yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention
weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose
Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache
eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal
Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the
perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form
scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs.
Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from
value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction
strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models
demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which
estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's
output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文比较了语言模型社会偏见评估的两种方法：令牌概率(TP)和自然语言推理(NLI)，发现它们行为差异很大，建议结合使用多种评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的令牌概率偏见评估方法虽然应用广泛，但被批评与真实世界语言模型使用场景和危害脱节，因此需要测试更现实的替代指标。

Method: 使用自然语言推理(NLI)作为偏见评估指标，并与传统的令牌概率(TP)方法进行比较分析。

Result: NLI和TP偏见评估行为差异显著，相关性很低；NLI更可能检测到"去偏见不足"的情况，但对反刻板印象句子的措辞更敏感脆弱。

Conclusion: 令牌概率和自然语言推理都不是在所有情况下"更好"的偏见指标，建议结合TP、NLI和下游偏见评估来确保语言模型的全面评估。

Abstract: Measurement of social bias in language models is typically by token
probability (TP) metrics, which are broadly applicable but have been criticized
for their distance from real-world langugage model use cases and harms. In this
work, we test natural language inference (NLI) as a more realistic alternative
bias metric. We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave
substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI
metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more
likely to detect "underdebiased" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more
brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP
approaches. We conclude that neither token probability nor natural language
inference is a "better" bias metric in all cases, and we recommend a
combination of TP, NLI, and downstream bias evaluations to ensure comprehensive
evaluation of language models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种系统化方法来压力测试大型语言模型的行为规范，自动识别当前模型规范中的原则冲突和解释模糊性。通过生成迫使模型在竞争性价值原则间做出权衡的场景，发现超过70,000个行为显著分歧的案例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI宪法和模型规范面临内部原则冲突和细微场景覆盖不足的关键挑战，需要系统化方法来识别和解决这些规范问题。

Method: 使用综合分类法生成多样化的价值权衡场景，迫使模型在无法同时满足的合法原则对之间做出选择。评估了12个前沿LLM的响应，通过价值分类分数衡量行为分歧。

Result: 识别了超过70,000个行为显著分歧的案例，实证表明这种高分歧强烈预测了模型规范中的潜在问题。定性分析揭示了当前模型规范中的直接矛盾和原则解释模糊性等问题。

Conclusion: 模型行为的高度分歧是模型规范问题的强有力指标，生成的测试场景能有效揭示规范中的矛盾、模糊性和误对齐案例，为改进模型规范提供了重要依据。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained from AI constitutions
and model specifications that establish behavioral guidelines and ethical
principles. However, these specifications face critical challenges, including
internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced
scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model
character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle
contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs.
  We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force
explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a
comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where
models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be
simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs
across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral
disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we
identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence.
Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts
underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we
provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct
contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally,
our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and
false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we
also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.

Motivation: 大型语言模型正在改变细胞生物学，使得开发能够表示、预测和推理细胞状态和行为的"虚拟细胞"计算系统成为可能。

Method: 提出了统一的分类法，将现有方法组织为两种范式：LLMs作为预言机（用于直接细胞建模）和LLMs作为智能体（用于协调复杂科学任务）。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming cellular biology by enabling
the development of "virtual cells"--computational systems that represent,
predict, and reason about cellular states and behaviors. This work provides a
comprehensive review of LLMs for virtual cell modeling. We propose a unified
taxonomy that organizes existing methods into two paradigms: LLMs as Oracles,
for direct cellular modeling, and LLMs as Agents, for orchestrating complex
scientific tasks. We identify three core tasks--cellular representation,
perturbation prediction, and gene regulation inference--and review their
associated models, datasets, evaluation benchmarks, as well as the critical
challenges in scalability, generalizability, and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有仇恨言论检测模型主要依赖表层语言线索，难以有效泛化到多样化的风格变体，且不同平台的仇恨言论具有特定目标和风格，容易产生虚假相关性。

Method: 提出CADET因果表示学习框架，将仇恨言论建模为包含上下文环境、创作者动机、目标和风格等关键因素的因果图，通过解耦潜在因素和控制混杂变量来隔离真实的仇恨意图。

Result: CADET在综合实验中表现出优越性能，能够通过潜在空间中的反事实推理，稳健地识别各种形式的仇恨言论。

Conclusion: 因果先验在推进可泛化的仇恨言论检测方面具有巨大潜力，CADET框架为解决隐式仇恨言论检测问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: The proliferation of online hate speech poses a significant threat to the
harmony of the web. While explicit hate is easily recognized through overt
slurs, implicit hate speech is often conveyed through sarcasm, irony,
stereotypes, or coded language -- making it harder to detect. Existing hate
speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic
cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations.
Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct
groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations
between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches.
Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate
speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual
environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we
propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles
hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders,
thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues.
Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style
within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate
speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in
comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in
advancing generalizable hate speech detection.

TL;DR: MemWeaver是一个通过构建分层记忆来深度个性化生成的框架，能够捕捉用户兴趣的时间演化和语义关系，在LaMP基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户与互联网的交互方式正从隐式反馈转向显式文本交互，这为深度个性化提供了机会。但现有方法仅将用户历史视为扁平文本列表，无法建模反映用户兴趣动态变化的丰富时间和语义结构。

Method: 提出MemWeaver框架，将用户全部文本历史编织成层次化记忆。核心创新是构建两个互补的记忆组件：行为记忆（捕捉具体用户行为）和认知记忆（表示长期偏好），两者都整合了时间和语义信息但处于不同抽象层次。

Result: 在Language Model Personalization (LaMP)基准测试中验证了MemWeaver的有效性。

Conclusion: MemWeaver的双组件记忆作为用户的统一表示，使大语言模型能够同时推理具体行为和抽象特征，实现了深度个性化生成。

Abstract: The primary form of user-internet engagement is shifting from leveraging
implicit feedback signals, such as browsing and clicks, to harnessing the rich
explicit feedback provided by textual interactive behaviors. This shift unlocks
a rich source of user textual history, presenting a profound opportunity for a
deeper form of personalization. However, prevailing approaches offer only a
shallow form of personalization, as they treat user history as a flat list of
texts for retrieval and fail to model the rich temporal and semantic structures
reflecting dynamic nature of user interests. In this work, we propose
\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history
into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core
innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal
evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different
activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory
components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at
different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific
user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences.
This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user,
allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors
and abstracted traits. Experiments on the Language Model Personalization (LaMP)
benchmark validate the efficacy of MemWeaver. Our code is
available\footnote{https://github.com/fishsure/MemWeaver}.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的图RAG方法虽然能构建知识图谱连接分散事实，但缺乏深度结构化推理能力，导致复杂多跳问答中证据不完整和错误累积。

Method: 将复杂问题分解为有序的子问题链，为每个子问题从图中检索相关三元组，必要时实时从源文档动态扩展图谱，并将所有使用的三元组聚合到图记忆中。

Result: 在三个多跳问答基准测试中，SubQRAG实现了持续且显著的改进，特别是在精确匹配分数方面。

Conclusion: SubQRAG通过子问题驱动的框架有效增强了推理深度，解决了传统图RAG在复杂多跳问答中的局限性。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) effectively builds a
knowledge graph (KG) to connect disparate facts across a large document corpus.
However, this broad-view approach often lacks the deep structured reasoning
needed for complex multi-hop question answering (QA), leading to incomplete
evidence and error accumulation. To address these limitations, we propose
SubQRAG, a sub-question-driven framework that enhances reasoning depth. SubQRAG
decomposes a complex question into an ordered chain of verifiable
sub-questions. For each sub-question, it retrieves relevant triples from the
graph. When the existing graph is insufficient, the system dynamically expands
it by extracting new triples from source documents in real time. All triples
used in the reasoning process are aggregated into a "graph memory," forming a
structured and traceable evidence path for final answer generation. Experiments
on three multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that SubQRAG achieves consistent
and significant improvements, especially in Exact Match scores.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Multilingual Knowledge Graph Completion
(MKGC) aim to predict missing facts by leveraging LLMs' multilingual
understanding capabilities, improving the completeness of multilingual
knowledge graphs (KGs). However, existing MKGC research underutilizes the
multilingual capabilities of LLMs and ignores the shareability of cross-lingual
knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel MKGC framework that leverages
multilingual shared knowledge to significantly enhance performance through two
components: Knowledge-level Grouped Mixture of Experts (KL-GMoE) and Iterative
Entity Reranking (IER). KL-GMoE efficiently models shared knowledge, while IER
significantly enhances its utilization. To evaluate our framework, we
constructed a mKG dataset containing 5 languages and conducted comprehensive
comparative experiments with existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) MKGC method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves improvements of
5.47%, 3.27%, and 1.01% in the Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10 metrics,
respectively, compared with SOTA MKGC method. Further experimental analysis
revealed the properties of knowledge sharing in settings of unseen and
unbalanced languages. We have released the dataset and code for our work on
https://github.com/gaoxiaofei07/KL-GMoE.

Result: ToolExpander显著提升了LLM的工具使用能力，特别是在较弱的小规模模型中，改善了训练稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: ToolExpander框架有效解决了GRPO训练中的关键问题，为资源受限的LLM提供了更稳定的工具导向强化学习方案。

Abstract: Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) encounters a significant challenge: models often fail to produce
accurate responses, particularly in small-scale architectures. This limitation
not only diminishes performance improvements and undermines the potential of
GRPO but also frequently leads to mid-training collapse, adversely affecting
stability and final efficacy. To address these issues, we propose ToolExpander,
a novel framework that advances tool-oriented reinforcement learning for
resource-constrained LLMs through two key innovations:(1) Dynamic Multi-Round
Hard Sampling, which dynamically substitutes challenging samples(those without
correct outputs over 10 rollouts) with high-quality few-shot demonstrations
during training, coupled with an exponential learning rate decay strategy to
mitigate oscillations;(2) Self-Exemplifying Thinking, an enhanced GRPO
framework that eliminates KL divergence and incorporates adjusted clipping
coefficients, encouraging models to autonomously generate and analyze few-shot
examples via a minimal additional reward (0.01).Experimental results
demonstrate that ToolExpander significantly enhances tool-using capabilities in
LLMs, especially in weaker small-scale models, improving both training
stability and overall performance.

Abstract: Reward modeling lies at the core of reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), yet most existing reward models rely on scalar or pairwise
judgments that fail to capture the multifaceted nature of human preferences.
Recent studies have explored rubrics-as-rewards (RaR) that uses structured
natural language criteria that capture multiple dimensions of response quality.
However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key
challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale
collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and
rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive
evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which
derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit
qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve
reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to
remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our
rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines
by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and
biomedical benchmarks. Our results show that rubrics provide scalable alignment
signals that narrow the gap between costly human evaluation and automated
reward modeling, enabling a new principle-driven paradigm for LLM alignment.

Result: 实验表明两种采样策略都能有效扩展计算，并展现不同的探索动态，潜在奖励模型能够实现有效的轨迹选择。

Conclusion: 这项工作为连续空间中的可扩展推理开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Parallel test-time scaling (TTS) is a pivotal approach for enhancing large
language models (LLMs), typically by sampling multiple token-based
chains-of-thought in parallel and aggregating outcomes through voting or
search. Recent advances in latent reasoning, where intermediate reasoning
unfolds in continuous vector spaces, offer a more efficient alternative to
explicit Chain-of-Thought, yet whether such latent models can similarly benefit
from parallel TTS remains open, mainly due to the absence of sampling
mechanisms in continuous space, and the lack of probabilistic signals for
advanced trajectory aggregation. \ This work enables parallel TTS for latent
reasoning models by addressing the above issues. For sampling, we introduce two
uncertainty-inspired stochastic strategies: Monte Carlo Dropout and Additive
Gaussian Noise. For aggregation, we design a Latent Reward Model (LatentRM)
trained with step-wise contrastive objective to score and guide latent
reasoning. Extensive experiments and visualization analyses show that both
sampling strategies scale effectively with compute and exhibit distinct
exploration dynamics, while LatentRM enables effective trajectory selection.
Together, our explorations open a new direction for scalable inference in
continuous spaces. Code released at https://github.com/YRYangang/LatentTTS.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在多项选择题中的推理策略，特别是当它们仅基于选项就能成功作答时，这种部分输入的成功是否总是问题。

Method: 让推理型LLMs在完整输入和仅有选项的情况下解决多项选择题，分析推理轨迹以了解其策略。

Result: 测试时推理通常能提高完整输入的准确性，在仅有选项的情况下也能在一半时间提高准确性。推理轨迹通过了忠实性测试，显示LLMs使用了推断缺失问题等策略。

Conclusion: 部分输入的成功并不总是问题，推理轨迹可以帮助区分有问题的数据和无问题的推理策略。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now give reasoning before answering, excelling
in tasks like multiple-choice question answering (MCQA). Yet, a concern is that
LLMs do not solve MCQs as intended, as work finds LLMs sans reasoning succeed
in MCQA without using the question, i.e., choices-only. Such partial-input
success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these
strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these
strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs;
test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the
time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely
affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass
faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring
missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is
always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic
data from less problematic reasoning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) equipped with external tools have demonstrated
enhanced performance on complex reasoning tasks. The widespread adoption of
this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific
tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable
and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating
tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability
bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an
unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an
expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address
this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an
unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system
first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into
semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent
framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code
to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a
reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete
functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous
question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools
without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning
performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows
enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific
increases.

Motivation: 传统基于最终答案的奖励机制容易导致奖励黑客，使模型通过不合理的推理过程得到正确答案，高估模型的实际推理能力。

Method: 引入Rubric奖励模型(RRM)，通过问题特定的评分标准评估整个推理过程，提供细粒度的校准奖励，惩罚逻辑缺陷并鼓励严谨推导。

Result: 在四个数学基准测试中，RRM训练持续优于仅基于结果的监督方法，将AIME2024的Verified Pass@1024从26.7%提升到62.6%，奇迹步骤发生率减少71%。

Conclusion: 奖励解决方案过程对于构建更准确、更可靠的模型至关重要，过程导向的奖励比仅基于结果的监督更有效。

Abstract: Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with
outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments,
we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading
to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is
evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the
correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic
analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure
modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct
output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a
strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the
model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To
mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a
process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory
against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained,
calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage
rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline,
RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across
four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from
26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work
demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models
that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功解决了LLMs中真实性与安全对齐之间的冲突，能够在提高事实准确性的同时保持模型的安全拒绝能力。

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) has been widely studied in
recent years, with progress in both detection and mitigation aimed at improving
truthfulness. Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing
truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we
investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often
comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this
arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode
hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress
factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign
datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same
reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related
features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves
refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This
approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety
alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful
benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach
preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between
truthfulness and safety.

Abstract: Few-shot Multi-label Intent Detection (MID) is crucial for dialogue systems,
aiming to detect multiple intents of utterances in low-resource dialogue
domains. Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn
representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a
threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these
methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations,
leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a
multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner,
which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge
propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the
interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate
label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set)
instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between
instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent
for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed
to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance.
Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC
and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 现实世界中的LLM部署需要持续的多轮交互，但存在上下文漂移问题——模型输出逐渐偏离目标一致行为。这种漂移在时间维度上展开，难以用静态评估指标捕捉。

Method: 将漂移形式化为测试模型与目标一致参考模型之间逐轮token级预测分布的KL散度，提出一个递归模型将其解释为具有恢复力和可控干预的有界随机过程。

Result: 实验表明多轮漂移表现出稳定的噪声限制均衡而非失控退化，简单的提醒干预能可靠地减少发散，与理论预测一致。

Conclusion: 多轮漂移可以被理解为可控的均衡现象而非不可避免的衰减，为研究和缓解扩展交互中的上下文漂移提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction
following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained
multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and
evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual
divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns.
Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by
static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in
multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret
its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the
token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent
reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution
as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable
interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon
rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\tau$-Bench,
measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators.
Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather
than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions
reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together,
these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable
equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation
for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.

Motivation: 大语言模型在剪枝时通常只使用少量校准数据，导致输出不匹配不可避免。直接最小二乘拟合容易过拟合，破坏预训练权重。

Method: 在旋转约束下更新剪枝参数，保持输出表示的几何特性（范数和内积），同时重新对齐剪枝子空间与原始输出。设计了方差感知重要性评分，优先保留对主方向影响大的维度。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B上的实验表明，在WikiText-2和多个语言理解基准测试中，困惑度和任务准确率均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合旋转约束更新和方差感知评分的方法能有效补偿剪枝误差，同时以几何保持的方式保留重要组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to
address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models
(LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic
knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically
carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output
mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such
errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively
modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned
parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the
geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and
simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs.
Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that
strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error
recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect
these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that
ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By
combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed
method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to
be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply
the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple
language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better
perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.

remains fragmented across data modalities, architectures, and evaluation

agentic-and map them to eight key analytical tasks including annotation,
trajectory and perturbation modeling, and drug-response prediction. Drawing on
over 40 public datasets, we analyze benchmark suitability, data diversity, and
ethical or scalability constraints, and evaluate models across 10 domain
dimensions covering biological grounding, multi-omics alignment, fairness,

Motivation: 现有基于结果奖励的RL训练方法缺乏细粒度控制，导致agentic RAG存在过度搜索和搜索不足等低效行为。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为可解析步骤，应用分层奖励函数评估每个搜索决策的必要性，在结果和格式奖励基础上增加基于最优搜索步骤比例的额外奖励。

Result: 在7个QA基准测试中，Qwen2.5和Llama-3.2模型达到65.4%(3B)和67.2%(7B)的平均准确率，过度搜索率降至2.3%，同时降低搜索不足率。

Conclusion: HiPRAG证明了通过RL进行细粒度控制对于提升搜索代理推理效率和最优性的重要性和潜力。

Abstract: Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information
that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering.
However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search
(retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when
necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current
training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL
framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these
inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for
Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a
fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our
approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by
decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We
then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus
based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of
commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and
Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method
achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished
while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3%
and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the
efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final
outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good
generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes,
and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained
control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning
for search agents.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GTD能生成高度任务自适应、稀疏且高效的通信拓扑，在LLM智能体协作中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GTD框架通过迭代引导的拓扑扩散过程，有效解决了多智能体系统通信拓扑设计的复杂权衡问题。

Abstract: The efficiency of multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs)
largely hinges on their communication topology. However, designing an optimal
topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing
objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness.
Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which
inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either
excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for
complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative
framework called \textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by
conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis
as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered
by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g.,
accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization
towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process
distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better
navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple
benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly
task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly
outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.

Motivation: 生成信息检索在单语言场景表现优异，但在多语言检索中面临跨语言标识符错位和标识符膨胀两大挑战，限制了其应用效果。

Method: 提出MGR-CSC框架，通过跨语言语义压缩将语义等价的多语言关键词统一为共享原子来对齐语义并压缩标识符空间，同时采用动态多步约束解码策略进行检索。

Result: 在mMarco100k和mNQ320k数据集上分别提升检索准确率6.83%和4.77%，同时标识符长度分别减少74.51%和78.2%。

Conclusion: MGR-CSC通过语义对齐和标识符压缩有效解决了多语言生成检索的关键问题，在提升检索准确率的同时显著提高了解码效率。

Abstract: Generative Information Retrieval is an emerging retrieval paradigm that
exhibits remarkable performance in monolingual scenarios.However, applying
these methods to multilingual retrieval still encounters two primary
challenges, cross-lingual identifier misalignment and identifier inflation. To
address these limitations, we propose Multilingual Generative Retrieval via
Cross-lingual Semantic Compression (MGR-CSC), a novel framework that unifies
semantically equivalent multilingual keywords into shared atoms to align
semantics and compresses the identifier space, and we propose a dynamic
multi-step constrained decoding strategy during retrieval. MGR-CSC improves
cross-lingual alignment by assigning consistent identifiers and enhances
decoding efficiency by reducing redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that
MGR-CSC achieves outstanding retrieval accuracy, improving by 6.83% on
mMarco100k and 4.77% on mNQ320k, while reducing document identifiers length by
74.51% and 78.2%, respectively.

TL;DR: AdaSwitch是一种新颖的知识蒸馏方法，通过在token级别动态结合on-policy和off-policy生成，解决小语言模型性能提升的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在延迟和计算约束下性能提升困难，现有知识蒸馏方法存在训练-推理不匹配或依赖低质量学生输出的问题。

Method: 提出AdaSwitch方法，允许学生先探索自身预测，然后基于实时质量评估选择性整合教师指导，动态结合两种生成策略。

Result: 在三个数据集和两对教师-学生LLM上的实验表明，AdaSwitch持续提高准确性，为小语言模型蒸馏提供了实用有效的方法。

Conclusion: AdaSwitch同时保持了一致性和监督质量，为小语言模型的知识蒸馏提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are crucial for applications with strict latency
and computational constraints, yet achieving high performance remains
challenging. Knowledge distillation (KD) can transfer capabilities from large
teacher models, but existing methods involve trade-offs: off-policy
distillation provides high-quality supervision but introduces a
training-inference mismatch, while on-policy approaches maintain consistency
but rely on low-quality student outputs. To address these issues, we propose
AdaSwitch, a novel approach that dynamically combines on-policy and off-policy
generation at the token level. AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore
its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on
real-time quality assessment. This approach simultaneously preserves
consistency and maintains supervision quality. Experiments on three datasets
with two teacher-student LLM pairs demonstrate that AdaSwitch consistently
improves accuracy, offering a practical and effective method for distilling
SLMs with acceptable additional overhead.

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has redefined Machine Translation
(MT), enabling context-aware and fluent translations across hundreds of
languages and textual domains. Despite their remarkable capabilities, LLMs
often exhibit uneven performance across language families and specialized
domains. Moreover, recent evidence reveals that these models can encode and
amplify different biases present in their training data, posing serious
concerns for fairness, especially in low-resource languages. To address these
gaps, we introduce Translation Tangles, a unified framework and dataset for
evaluating the translation quality and fairness of open-source LLMs. Our
approach benchmarks 24 bidirectional language pairs across multiple domains
using different metrics. We further propose a hybrid bias detection pipeline
that integrates rule-based heuristics, semantic similarity filtering, and
LLM-based validation. We also introduce a high-quality, bias-annotated dataset
based on human evaluations of 1,439 translation-reference pairs. The code and
dataset are accessible on GitHub:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了TRACE分析框架，系统研究LLM在长思维链推理中的"过度思考"问题，发现过度验证和过度探索是主要原因，并提出了基于效用的过度思考定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长思维链推理模型在复杂任务上表现优异，但存在"过度思考"的低效问题——即使是简单查询也会进行不必要的冗长推理，导致计算资源浪费而准确性没有提升。现有研究对过度思考的成因理解不足，大多停留在表面分析层面。

Method: 提出TRACE分析框架：1）将思维过程分解为最小完整子思维；2）通过推断子思维间的语篇关系构建细粒度思维进展图；3）识别相似主题查询的常见思维模式。

Result: 基准测试证实长思维模型在简单任务上速度慢5-20倍且无实质性收益。分析发现开放权重思维模型主要有两种模式：探索者模式和晚期着陆模式，表明过度验证和过度探索是过度思考的主要驱动因素。

Conclusion: 基于思维结构提出了基于效用的过度思考定义，超越了基于长度的度量方法，为理解LLM思维进展和原则性过度思考管理提供了更深入的见解和实践指导。

Abstract: Models employing long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have shown superior
performance on complex reasoning tasks. Yet, this capability introduces a
critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often
engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring
significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has
explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our
understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to
superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner
workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs'
thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking
issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on
simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose
the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring
discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought
progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for
topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for
open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides
evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of
overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a
utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based
metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of
LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled
overthinking management.

Conclusion: 证明了现有语音交互模型在语言对齐方面的缺陷，提出的方法有效提升了多语言场景下的性能，CS3-Bench为相关研究提供了评估基准。

Abstract: The advancement of multimodal large language models has accelerated the
development of speech-to-speech interaction systems. While natural monolingual
interaction has been achieved, we find existing models exhibit deficiencies in
language alignment. In our proposed Code-Switching Speech-to-Speech Benchmark
(CS3-Bench), experiments on 7 mainstream models demonstrate a relative
performance drop of up to 66% in knowledge-intensive question answering and
varying degrees of misunderstanding in open-ended conversations. Starting from
a model with severe performance deterioration, we propose both data
constructions and training approaches to improve the language alignment
capabilities, specifically employing Chain of Recognition (CoR) to enhance
understanding and Keyword Highlighting (KH) to guide generation. Our approach
improves the knowledge accuracy from 25.14% to 46.13%, with open-ended
understanding rate from 64.5% to 86.5%, and significantly reduces pronunciation

Method: 利用隐式奖励与对比解码的结构等价性，提出对比弱到强泛化框架，在前后对齐的弱模型间进行对比解码

Result: 在不同模型系列上均获得一致改进，实现了更可靠的能力转移、去噪和鲁棒性提升

Conclusion: ConG有潜力推进弱到强泛化，为通向AGI提供有前景的路径

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization provides a promising paradigm for scaling large
language models (LLMs) by training stronger models on samples from aligned
weaker ones, without requiring human feedback or explicit reward modeling.
However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases
in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address
this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit
rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence
with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in
LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive
Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive
decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality
samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising,
and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of
traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model
families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and
effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of
ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway
toward AGI.

Motivation: 方言主要是口语形式，非标准拼写在文本处理中存在问题，需要研究标准到方言迁移在不同模态下的效果。

Method: 在德语和多个德语方言的书面和口语意图分类任务中，比较文本模型、语音模型以及语音转录后文本处理的级联系统。

Result: 语音模型在方言数据上表现最佳，文本模型在标准数据上表现最好。如果转录系统生成标准化的输出，级联系统在方言数据上表现相对较好。

Conclusion: 方言处理中语音模型优于文本模型，级联系统在特定条件下也能取得不错效果，强调了方言语音处理的重要性。

Abstract: Research on cross-dialectal transfer from a standard to a non-standard
dialect variety has typically focused on text data. However, dialects are
primarily spoken, and non-standard spellings are known to cause issues in text
processing. We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text
models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets
automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our
experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of
written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the
first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the
speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the
text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag
behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the
dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like
output.

Motivation: 由于前沿LLMs在许多传统基准测试上已趋于饱和，需要更具挑战性的基准来提供客观验证。

Method: 设计MCBench基准，通过逐步指令让LLMs执行字符串匹配NLP指标，并提供并行参考代码来验证输出准确性。包含三种评估指标和三种基准变体。

Result: MCBench被证明是评估前沿LLMs能力的有效客观工具。

Conclusion: MCBench提供了一个客观、确定性和可代码验证的评估框架，能够系统测试LLMs在逐步执行、指令遵循和数值计算等方面的能力。

Abstract: Recent frontier-level LLMs have saturated many previously difficult
benchmarks, leaving little room for further differentiation. This progress
highlights the need for challenging benchmarks that provide objective
verification. In this paper, we introduce MCBench, a benchmark designed to
evaluate whether LLMs can execute string-matching NLP metrics by strictly
following step-by-step instructions. Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on
subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective,
deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to
systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution,
including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range
consistency in handling intermediate results. To ensure objective evaluation of
these abilities, we provide a parallel reference code that can evaluate the
accuracy of LLM output. We provide three evaluative metrics and three benchmark
variants designed to measure the detailed instruction understanding capability
of LLMs. Our analyses show that MCBench serves as an effective and objective
tool for evaluating the capabilities of cutting-edge LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出ACE框架，通过神经元级归因识别和编辑关键查询-值通路，解决了大语言模型在多跳事实回忆中知识编辑性能衰减的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法在多跳事实回忆中表现显著衰减，特别是在涉及推理链中隐式中间主题时。这种限制源于对链式知识在神经元层面如何动态表示和利用的忽视。

Method: 通过因果分析发现隐式主题在推理过程中作为查询神经元，顺序激活对应的值神经元来积累信息。提出ACE框架，利用神经元级归因识别和编辑这些关键的查询-值通路。

Result: ACE在GPT-J上比最先进方法提升9.44%，在Qwen3-8B上提升37.46%。分析进一步揭示了Qwen3中更细粒度的激活模式，并证明值神经元的语义可解释性是由查询驱动的积累过程组织的。

Conclusion: 这些发现基于对内部推理机制的原则性理解，为推进知识编辑能力建立了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to
update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant
performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly
acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning
chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an
oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at
the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit
subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding
value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the
final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight,
we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual
Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and
edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically
grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals
more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the
semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven
accumulation. These findings establish a new pathway for advancing KE
capabilities based on the principled understanding of internal reasoning
mechanisms.

Abstract: Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the
open-ended nature of student responses. Existing works primarily focus on a
specific type of subjective question and lack the generality to support
comprehensive exams that contain diverse question types. In this paper, we
propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework
that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions
across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to
holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching
module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we
leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments
on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework
consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple
grading metrics. Moreover, the proposed system has been successfully deployed
in real-world training and certification exams at a major e-commerce
enterprise.

Knowledge Distillation for Enhancing Reasoning Ability in Multi-Step
Retrieval-Augmented Language Models (StepER). StepER employs step-wise
supervision to align with evolving information and reasoning demands across

progressively optimize learning by prioritizing suitable steps. Our method is
adaptable to various multi-step retrieval-augmented language models, including
those that use retrieval queries for reasoning paths or decomposed questions.
Extensive experiments show that StepER outperforms prior methods on multi-hop

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能出色，但经常产生不完整或选择性省略关键信息的输出，在敏感领域这种遗漏可能造成与事实错误相当的严重危害。

Method: 研究了三种自动化评估策略：基于NLI的方法将文本分解为原子语句并使用自然语言推理识别缺失链接；基于问答的方法提取问答对并比较不同来源的响应；端到端方法直接使用LLM识别缺失内容。

Result: 实验表明简单的端到端方法在效果上出人意料地优于更复杂的方法，但代价是降低了鲁棒性、可解释性和结果粒度。

Conclusion: 端到端方法在检测LLM生成文本完整性方面表现最佳，但需要在效果与可解释性之间权衡。

Abstract: Despite demonstrating remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
large language models (LLMs) have also been found to frequently produce outputs
that are incomplete or selectively omit key information. In sensitive domains,
such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by
factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the
challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing
on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We
investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that
decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference
(NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts
question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an
end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our
experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end
approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced
robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the
comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when
answering user queries based on multiple sources.

Abstract: This article presents research conducted at the Institute of the Estonian
Language between 2022 and 2025 on the application of large language models
(LLMs) to the study of 17th and 18th century Estonian dictionaries. The authors
address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word
forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on
sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a
unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648
dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic
enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context,
Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81%
of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732
dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of
headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the
Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping
tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text
recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings
demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for
saving time and financial resources.

Result: 在八个开放域QA基准测试中实现新的最先进性能，A²Search-7B在四个多跳基准测试中平均AnsF1@1得分48.4%，优于所有强基线，包括更大的ReSearch-32B（46.2%）。

Conclusion: A²Search能够解决歧义并在基准测试间泛化，表明接受歧义对于构建更可靠的问答系统至关重要。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning
(RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA).
However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple
valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold
answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals.
Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation,
which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue.
In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training
framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated
pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via
trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with
RL using a carefully designed $\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally
accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks
demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With
only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$
score of $48.4\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong
baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\%$).
Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and
generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is
essential for building more reliable QA systems. Our code, data, and model
weights can be found at https://github.com/zfj1998/A2Search

### [160] [LightReasoner: Can Small Language Models Teach Large Language Models Reasoning?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07962)
*Jingyuan Wang,Yankai Chen,Zhonghang Li,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LightReasoner是一个新颖框架，利用小型语言模型(SLM)来指导大型语言模型(LLM)的推理能力，通过专家-业余对比识别关键推理时刻，显著提升推理性能同时大幅降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调(SFT)方法资源密集，需要大量标注数据，且对所有token进行均匀优化，而实际上只有少数token具有重要学习价值。本文探索小型模型能否通过揭示高价值推理时刻来指导大型模型。

Method: LightReasoner框架包含两个阶段：(1)采样阶段：通过专家(LLM)与业余(SLM)模型的行为差异识别关键推理时刻，构建对比监督样本；(2)微调阶段：使用这些蒸馏样本对齐专家模型，放大其推理优势。

Result: 在七个数学基准测试中，LightReasoner将准确率提升高达28.1%，同时减少90%时间消耗、80%采样问题和99%微调token使用，且不依赖真实标签。

Conclusion: 通过将较弱的小型模型转化为有效的教学信号，LightReasoner为推进LLM推理提供了一种可扩展且资源高效的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
reasoning, often through supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, SFT is
resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled
demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a
fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a
counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language
models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the
latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that
leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a
weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a
sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs
supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur
contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these
distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven
mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while
reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token
usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker
SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and
resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning. Code is available at:

TL;DR: LLMs在社交推理任务中存在困难，无法区分客观现实与主观信念。本文提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，通过构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，显著提升社交推理准确性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在数学和代码推理方面表现出色，但在社交推理任务中表现不佳，存在认知混淆、逻辑不一致以及客观世界状态与主观信念状态混淆的问题。

Method: 提出自适应世界模型增强推理机制，构建动态文本世界模型来跟踪实体状态和时间序列，动态监控推理轨迹中的混淆指标，并通过提供清晰的世界状态描述进行干预。

Result: 在三个社交基准测试中，准确性显著提升（如Hi-ToM中+10%），同时计算成本降低（最高减少33.8%的token使用）。

Conclusion: 该机制为在社交场景中部署LLMs提供了一个简单而有效的解决方案，模仿了人类使用隐含世界模型来区分外部事件和内部信念的方式。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) excel in mathematical and code reasoning,
we observe they struggle with social reasoning tasks, exhibiting cognitive
confusion, logical inconsistencies, and conflation between objective world
states and subjective belief states. Through deteiled analysis of DeepSeek-R1's
reasoning trajectories, we find that LLMs frequently encounter reasoning
impasses and tend to output contradictory terms like "tricky" and "confused"
when processing scenarios with multiple participants and timelines, leading to
erroneous reasoning or infinite loops. The core issue is their inability to
disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this,
we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs
a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It
dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and
promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models
navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use
implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal
beliefs. Evaluations on three social benchmarks demonstrate significant
improvements in accuracy (e.g., +10% in Hi-ToM) while reducing computational
costs (up to 33.8% token reduction), offering a simple yet effective solution
for deploying LLMs in social contexts.

TL;DR: 提出一个用于科学图表标题生成的两阶段系统，结合上下文筛选和作者特定写作风格优化，在SciCap挑战中显著提升了标题质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学图表标题需要准确性和风格一致性来传达视觉信息，现有方法在结合上下文理解和作者特定风格方面存在不足。

Method: 两阶段流程：第一阶段通过DSPy的MIPROv2和SIMBA进行类别特定提示优化和标题候选选择；第二阶段使用少量示例提示结合作者档案进行风格精炼。

Result: 类别特定提示相比零样本方法提升ROUGE-1召回率+8.3%，BLEU-4损失限制在-10.9%；风格精炼带来BLEU分数40-48%和ROUGE分数25-27%的提升。

Conclusion: 结合上下文理解和作者特定风格适应可以生成既科学准确又风格忠实于源论文的图表标题。

Abstract: Scientific figure captions require both accuracy and stylistic consistency to
convey visual information. Here, we present a domain-specific caption
generation system for the 3rd SciCap Challenge that integrates figure-related
textual context with author-specific writing styles using the LaMP-Cap dataset.
Our approach uses a two-stage pipeline: Stage 1 combines context filtering,
category-specific prompt optimization via DSPy's MIPROv2 and SIMBA, and caption
candidate selection; Stage 2 applies few-shot prompting with profile figures
for stylistic refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that category-specific
prompts outperform both zero-shot and general optimized approaches, improving
ROUGE-1 recall by +8.3\% while limiting precision loss to -2.8\% and BLEU-4
reduction to -10.9\%. Profile-informed stylistic refinement yields 40--48\%
gains in BLEU scores and 25--27\% in ROUGE. Overall, our system demonstrates
that combining contextual understanding with author-specific stylistic
adaptation can generate captions that are both scientifically accurate and
stylistically faithful to the source paper.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在测试时是静态的，无法从经验中学习，缺乏知识积累和持续改进的能力。

Method: 提出MUSE框架，引入以分层记忆模块为中心的经验驱动自我进化系统，通过任务执行后的自主反思将原始轨迹转化为结构化经验。

Result: 在长时程生产力基准TAC上取得新的SOTA性能，仅使用轻量级Gemini-2.5 Flash模型，展示了强大的持续学习和自我进化能力。

Conclusion: MUSE为能够实现现实世界生产力任务自动化的AI代理建立了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, yet significant challenges persist when deploying them as AI
agents for real-world long-horizon tasks. Existing LLM agents suffer from a
critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from
experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously
improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent
framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered
around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of
experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across
multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously
reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured
experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism
enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering
continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon
productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant
margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments
demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits
increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust
continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated
experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling
zero-shot improvement on new tasks. MUSE establishes a new paradigm for AI
agents capable of real-world productivity task automation.

Motivation: 探索ChatGPT在日英翻译任务中的潜力，比较不同提示策略和翻译引擎的性能差异。

Method: 使用简单和增强提示进行日英翻译，进行自动评估和基于MQM的人工评估，比较文档级与句子级翻译效果。

Result: 文档级翻译优于句子级；增强提示与简单提示效果差异不明显；ChatGPT-3.5在准确性上更优，ChatGPT-4在流畅性上更好；ChatGPT与主流翻译系统表现相当。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在日英翻译中具有竞争力，文档级翻译策略更有效，不同版本在准确性和流畅性上各有优势。

Abstract: This study investigates ChatGPT for Japanese-English translation, exploring
simple and enhanced prompts and comparing against commercially available

we found that document-level translation outperforms sentence-level translation
for ChatGPT. On the other hand, we were not able to determine if enhanced
prompts performed better than simple prompts in our experiments. We also
discovered that ChatGPT-3.5 was preferred by automatic evaluation, but a
tradeoff exists between accuracy (ChatGPT-3.5) and fluency (ChatGPT-4). Lastly,
ChatGPT yields competitive results against two widely-known translation
systems.

TL;DR: LLMs能够从参数知识中回忆气候常态，但存在空间一致误差，特别是在高海拔和高纬度地区。包含地理上下文可减少27%的误差，但模型难以再现温度变化的空间模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解LLMs内部气候知识对于评估其在气候相关应用中的可靠性和误传风险至关重要，但目前LLMs回忆气候常态的能力尚未得到充分表征。

Method: 构建全球1度分辨率的网格查询，要求LLMs回忆1991-2020年7月平均2米气温，并将响应与ERA5再分析数据验证。

Result: LLMs编码了非平凡的气候结构，能捕捉纬度和地形模式，RMSE为3-6°C，偏差±1°C。但在海拔1500米以上性能急剧下降，RMSE达5-13°C。包含地理上下文平均减少27%误差。

Conclusion: 虽然LLMs能捕捉当前气候分布，但难以再现长期温度变化的空间模式，这对理解气候动力学至关重要。评估框架为量化LLMs参数气候知识提供了可复现基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for climate-related
applications, where understanding internal climatological knowledge is crucial
for reliability and misinformation risk assessment. Despite growing adoption,
the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge
remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary
LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a
prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified
locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\deg} resolution land
points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses
against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate
structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with
root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\deg}C and biases of $\pm$1 {\deg}C. However,
spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes.
Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\deg}C
compared to 2-4 {\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic
context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger
models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the
global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they
fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate
to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may
capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the
regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for
understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a
reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and
complements existing climate communication assessments.

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit advanced reasoning ability,
conventional alignment remains largely dominated by outcome reward models

Motivation: 传统集中式或完全本地训练方法在隐私保护和个性化之间难以平衡，现有联邦学习方法在有限客户端数据下容易过拟合，且多轮训练后容易遗忘全局信息，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FedDTRE方法，不直接替换本地模型为全局模型，而是利用全局和本地模型在公平导向评估数据集上的可信度得分，动态调节全局模型在本地更新中的贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明，FedDTRE能够提升对话模型性能，改善对话生成质量。

Conclusion: FedDTRE通过可信度评估的自适应聚合策略，有效解决了联邦对话生成中的过拟合和遗忘问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of artificial intelligence, dialogue systems have
become a prominent form of human-computer interaction. However, traditional
centralized or fully local training approaches face challenges in balancing
privacy preservation and personalization due to data privacy concerns and
heterogeneous device capabilities. Federated learning, as a representative
distributed paradigm, offers a promising solution. However, existing methods
often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget
global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor
generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated
adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness
Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model,
FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a
fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's
contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that
FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of
dialogue generation.

Method: 收集了3,000个人类合理性判断和13,600个LLM判断，分析在LLM生成的支持/反对论证存在时的评分变化。

Result: 人类在LLM支持论证存在时平均合理性评分上升，在反对论证存在时下降；LLM也表现出类似的影响模式。

Conclusion: LLM可用于研究人类认知，但也存在实际担忧：即使在人类擅长的常识领域，LLM也可能对人们的信念产生重大影响。

Abstract: We investigate the degree to which human plausibility judgments of
multiple-choice commonsense benchmark answers are subject to influence by
(im)plausibility arguments for or against an answer, in particular, using
rationales generated by LLMs. We collect 3,000 plausibility judgments from
humans and another 13,600 judgments from LLMs. Overall, we observe increases
and decreases in mean human plausibility ratings in the presence of
LLM-generated PRO and CON rationales, respectively, suggesting that, on the
whole, human judges find these rationales convincing. Experiments with LLMs
reveal similar patterns of influence. Our findings demonstrate a novel use of
LLMs for studying aspects of human cognition, while also raising practical
concerns that, even in domains where humans are ``experts'' (i.e., common
sense), LLMs have the potential to exert considerable influence on people's

Abstract: Negotiation is a fundamental challenge for AI agents, as it requires an
ability to reason strategically, model opponents, and balance cooperation with
competition. We conduct the first comprehensive study systematically evaluating
the effect of (LLM-)reasoning on the negotiation abilities of both commercial
and open-weight LLMs, and do this across three languages. Using a self-play
setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between
performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the
nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that
enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves
negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome
task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning
improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400
%. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning
distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their
internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus
possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of
reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language
consistency between their reasoning and final output.

Motivation: 由于每个语言模型都有自己的词汇表，它们在下一个token分布层面（如模型集成）难以相互协作，这限制了不同分词方式的模型之间的合作效率。

Method: 建立了一个无损词汇缩减的理论框架，通过数学方法将给定自回归语言模型转换为具有任意小词汇量的等价模型。

Conclusion: 提出的无损词汇缩减框架为不同分词方式的语言模型之间的协作提供了理论基础，解决了模型集成中的词汇不匹配问题。

Abstract: Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网红营销模糊了有机内容与赞助内容的界限，使透明度法规执行面临挑战。现有检测方法缺乏法律基础或作为'黑盒'运行，需要将法律知识有效应用于监管。

Method: 使用1,143个Instagram帖子，比较两种模型在三种提示策略下的表现，控制法律知识提供水平，开发法律推理错误分类法，结合定量和定性评估策略。

Result: 两种模型在分类赞助内容方面表现强劲（F1最高达0.93），但在模糊案例上性能下降超过10个百分点。常见错误包括引用遗漏（28.57%）、不明确引用（20.71%），隐藏广告的错误率最高（28.57%）。

Conclusion: 本研究为监管合规技术提供了LLM法律推理错误分类法，推进了网红营销内容的透明检测，开发了原始数据集和评估方法，支持广告监管机构在坚实法律基础上自动化审核流程。

Abstract: The rise of influencer marketing has blurred boundaries between organic
content and sponsored content, making the enforcement of legal rules relating
to transparency challenging. Effective regulation requires applying legal
knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of
undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as
opaque "black boxes". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and
gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels
of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying
content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over
10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning
errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references
(20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While
adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not
consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is
threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology
by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to
evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally
robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing
content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated
by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it
combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM
explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support
advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid
legal foundation.

Abstract: Using LLMs to evaluate text, that is, LLM-as-a-judge, is increasingly being
used at scale to augment or even replace human annotations. As such, it is
imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In
this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based
global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms:
1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates
verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global
Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and
verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on
seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that
the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the
LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to
text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study
to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.

Method: 将多个LLM评估模型集成到多智能体系统中，模拟客户端-服务器轮询机制进行无监督优化。

Result: Genii在实验中优于基于标注判断数据训练的监督模型，且无需人工标注。在不同客户端智能体的轮询过程中性能持续提升，即使使用较弱的模型作为服务器智能体。

Conclusion: Genii有效减轻了LLM评估模型的判断偏好偏差，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic evaluators, commonly referred to as
LLM-as-a-Judge, have also attracted growing attention. This approach plays a
vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and
reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment
preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses
generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This
paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised
multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent
judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates
various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the
interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent
unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised
models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled
annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client
agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents.
Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference
bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness. All codes

Method: 从历史客户-客服对话中提取问答对自动构建知识库，使用LLaMA-3.1-8B模型进行微调，利用检索增强生成(RAG)技术。

Result: 在20家公司评估中，系统在回答信息查询问题时达到90%以上准确率，性能优于更大的闭源LLM，能够立即部署RAG驱动的聊天机器人。

Conclusion: AI Knowledge Assist系统通过自动构建知识库和轻量级LLM微调，有效解决了联络中心对话AI系统的冷启动问题，实现了高性能的客户服务自动化。

Abstract: The utilization of conversational AI systems by leveraging Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to solve customer problems has been on
the rise with the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
absence of a company-specific dedicated knowledge base is a major barrier to
the integration of conversational AI systems in contact centers. To this end,
we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form
of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to
automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal
data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger
closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies
demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the
LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by
achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions. This
enables immediate deployment of RAG-powered chatbots.

Conclusion: 这是首个在商业对话数据上应用指令预训练的工作，为行业如何利用专有数据集进行领域适应提供了见解。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their
adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language
processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes
their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite
their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following
capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by
inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability
for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual
Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual
pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for
business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that
rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and
responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling
better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that
DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of
business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item
generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational
data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets
for domain adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生错误的拒绝，拒绝那些包含类似不安全查询术语的良性请求，这种过度安全拒绝问题需要系统性的诊断和缓解方法。

Method: 引入两个基准测试(XSB用于单轮提示，MS-XSB用于多轮对话)，利用事后解释方法识别拒绝触发器，并部署三种轻量级方法：忽略词指令、提示重述和注意力引导。

Result: 实验显示这些策略在四个指令调优的Llama模型上显著提高了安全提示的合规性，同时保持了强大的安全保护。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个可复现的框架来诊断和缓解过度拒绝问题，为更安全和更有帮助的LLM部署指明了实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently produce false refusals, declining
benign requests that contain terms resembling unsafe queries. We address this
challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety
Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with "Focus" keywords that
identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based
Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal
calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal
that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially
pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we
leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy
three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt
rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining
or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models
demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe
prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a
reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals,
highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.

Motivation: 大型推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，在简单任务上生成不必要的冗长推理。现有方法如长度惩罚或路由机制通常是启发式且任务特定的，缺乏自适应推理的通用框架。

Method: 提出ARM2统一模型，通过强化学习框架增强长度感知优化，自适应平衡推理性能与效率。整合视觉理解和可执行代码，扩展到多模态应用。

Result: 实验表明ARM2在性能上与使用GRPO训练的传统推理模型相当，同时平均减少超过70%的token使用。

Conclusion: ARM2通过自适应推理框架有效解决了过度思考问题，在保持性能的同时显著提高推理效率，并通过广泛分析验证了其设计合理性。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking''
problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some
strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties
or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific,
lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present
ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and
efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework
augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language
inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to
multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling
substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared
to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with
traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by
over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the
effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP研究主要关注诗歌自动生成和摘要，而韵律诗歌因其严格的音节和音素模式约束，为深入探究LLMs的推理能力和规则遵循能力提供了机会。

Method: 开发了MetricalARGS任务分类法，包含分析、检索、生成、支持四个维度，并以泰卢固语为例展示实际应用。

Result: 创建了系统性的评估框架，能够从多个维度全面评估LLMs在韵律诗歌处理方面的能力。

Conclusion: MetricalARGS通过韵律诗歌这一视角，为理解当前LLMs的能力和局限性提供了更广泛的可能性。

Abstract: Prior NLP work studying poetry has focused primarily on automatic poem
generation and summarization. Many languages have well-studied traditions of
poetic meter which enforce constraints on a poem in terms of syllable and
phoneme patterns. Such advanced literary forms offer opportunities for probing
deeper reasoning and language understanding in Large Language Models (LLMs) and
their ability to follow strict pre-requisites and rules. In this paper, we
introduce MetricalARGS, the first taxonomy of poetry-related NLP tasks designed
to evaluate LLMs on metrical poetry across four dimensions: Analysis,
Retrieval, Generation, and Support. We discuss how these tasks relate to
existing NLP tasks, addressing questions around datasets and evaluation
metrics. Taking Telugu as our example language, we illustrate how the taxonomy
can be used in practice. MetricalARGS highlights the broader possibilities for
understanding the capabilities and limitations of today's LLMs through the lens
of metrical poetry.

Conclusion: Training-Free GRPO是轻量级、成本效益高的解决方案，有效解决了数据稀缺和过拟合问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their
promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized
real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating
external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic
reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely
on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase
with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output
distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the
output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which
is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data
scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we
propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO),
a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any
parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage
instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling
high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal
ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is
seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments
on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that
Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly
improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples,
Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training
data and cost.

Motivation: 理解LLMs中记忆检索和巩固机制的工作方式，目前这些机制仍不清楚。

Method: 提出函数令牌假说，通过二分图分析和案例研究验证，展示函数令牌如何激活特征并主导训练损失。

Result: 实验证明少数函数令牌激活了大部分特征，函数令牌从上下文中选择最具预测性的特征来指导下一个令牌预测。

Conclusion: 函数令牌假说为理解LLMs的记忆机制提供了新视角，函数令牌在推理和预训练中发挥关键作用。

Abstract: The remarkable success of large language models (LLMs) stems from their
ability to consolidate vast amounts of knowledge into the memory during
pre-training and to retrieve it from the memory during inference, enabling
advanced capabilities such as knowledge memorization, instruction-following and
reasoning. However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in
LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token
hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens
activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token
prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens
(usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of
learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory
consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in
linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and
conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental
evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show
that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case
studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive
features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during
pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content
tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select
the most predictive features from context.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在恶意或不正确补全微调后，是否会在高风险场景下表现出更广泛的不诚实和欺骗行为，即涌现性失调现象。

Method: 对开源LLMs在不同领域进行失调补全的微调，并在下游混合任务和模拟人机交互环境中测试模型行为。

Result: LLMs在微调后表现出广泛的不诚实行为；仅1%的失调数据就能使诚实行为下降20%以上；10%的偏见用户群体就能无意中加剧助手LLM的不诚实。

Conclusion: 涌现性失调风险不仅存在于直接微调中，也存在于下游混合任务和实际人机交互中，需要引起重视。

Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect
completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical
advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is
called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this
phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of
dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under
pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced
LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results
demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty.
Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined
finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment
data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior
over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction
environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the
assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned
unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user
population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the
domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate
that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in
downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

Abstract: The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for a
comprehensive understanding of public sentiment and reactions. Despite the
availability of numerous public datasets on COVID-19, some reaching volumes of
up to 100 billion data points, challenges persist regarding the availability of
labeled data and the presence of coarse-grained or inappropriate sentiment
labels. In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained
multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing
COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages. The
dataset comprises 10,000 annotated tweets each in English and Arabic, along
with 30,000 translated tweets in Spanish, French, and Italian, derived from
English tweets. Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets
collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained
sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language
models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the
evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing
significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our
dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various
applications. Our dataset and accompanying code are publicly accessible on the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有因果关系抽取数据集只关注支持性因果关系(procausal)，完全忽略了反驳性因果关系(concausal)，甚至错误地将后者标注为前者。

Method: 通过广泛的文献回顾，将反因果关系理论操作化为严格的标注指南，并在Causal News Corpus基础上增加反因果陈述。

Result: 获得了较高的标注者间一致性(Cohen's κ=0.74)，证明不包含反因果关系训练的模型倾向于将反因果关系误分类为支持性因果关系。

Conclusion: 基于新数据集可以缓解这种错误，使transformer模型能够有效区分支持性和反驳性因果关系。

Abstract: Research on causality extraction from text has so far almost entirely
neglected counterclaims. Existing causality extraction datasets focus solely on
"procausal" claims, i.e., statements that support a relationship. "Concausal"
claims, i.e., statements that refute a relationship, are entirely ignored or
even accidentally annotated as procausal. We address this shortcoming by
developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive
literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of
causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the
form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News
Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator
agreement of Cohen's $\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of
integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal
relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new
dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively
distinguish pro- and concausality.

TL;DR: WaltzRL是一个多智能体强化学习框架，通过对话智能体和反馈智能体的协作训练，在保持帮助性的同时提高LLM的安全性，显著减少不安全回复和过度拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法存在两个问题：容易受到对抗攻击产生不安全内容，以及对良性但敏感提示的过度拒绝。当前方法通常完全拒绝任何不安全内容，这会加剧过度拒绝问题且无法提供细致的指导。

Method: 提出WaltzRL多智能体强化学习框架，将安全对齐建模为协作的正和博弈。联合训练对话智能体和反馈智能体，使用动态改进奖励(DIR)根据对话智能体整合反馈的效果进行激励。推理时改进而非丢弃不安全或过度拒绝的回复。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的实验表明，WaltzRL显著减少了不安全回复（如WildJailbreak上从39.0%降至4.6%）和过度拒绝（OR-Bench上从45.3%降至9.9%），优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: WaltzRL通过让对话和反馈智能体共同进化并自适应应用反馈，在不降低通用能力的情况下增强了LLM安全性，推进了帮助性和无害性之间的帕累托前沿。

Abstract: Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful
and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing
challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content,
and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current
approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely
reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music
entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance
for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we
propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that
formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL
jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is
incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and
helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a
Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the
conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or
overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than
discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent
and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency
on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets,
demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g.,
from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on
OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and
feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances
LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto
front between helpfulness and harmlessness.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on huge amounts of textual data, and
concerns have been raised that the limits of such data may soon be reached. A
potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this
work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive
decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we
experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good
and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By
amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a
synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show
that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on
the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular,
we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding
benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from
traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic
capabilities.

TL;DR: DeepMiner是一个通过高难度训练任务和动态上下文窗口来激发多轮智能体深层推理能力的新框架，在多个搜索智能体基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在具有长视野交互的多轮智能体中激发深层推理能力，需要解决训练数据挑战性和上下文管理问题。

Method: 提出反向构建方法从真实网络源生成复杂但可验证的问答对，设计动态上下文管理策略使用滑动窗口机制，无需外部摘要模型。

Result: DeepMiner-32B在BrowseComp-en上达到33.5%准确率，比之前最佳开源智能体提升近20个百分点，在多个基准测试中表现一致提升，支持近100轮持续交互。

Conclusion: DeepMiner通过高难度训练和动态上下文管理有效解决了多轮交互系统的上下文限制问题，显著提升了智能体的推理能力。

Abstract: While recent advances in reasoning models have demonstrated cognitive
behaviors through reinforcement learning, existing approaches struggle to
invoke deep reasoning capabilities in multi-turn agents with long-horizon
interactions. We propose DeepMiner, a novel framework that elicits such
abilities by introducing high-difficulty training tasks and dynamic context
window. DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex
but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures
the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive
capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant
yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and
inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency
on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to
handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement
learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial
performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner
attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best
open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent
improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our
dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns
within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context
limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.

*Taisei Yamamoto,Ryoma Kumon,Danushka Bollegala,Hitomi Yanaka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过神经元级分析识别了驱动大语言模型文化行为的神经元，发现了文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元，这些神经元集中在浅层到中层MLP层中，占比不到1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在全球部署，确保其公平和全面的文化理解很重要。但现有模型存在文化偏见和对少数文化认知有限的问题，且其文化理解机制尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用基于梯度的评分方法进行神经元级分析，结合额外过滤进行精确细化，识别文化通用神经元和文化特定神经元。

Result: 发现抑制这些神经元会显著降低文化基准测试性能（最多下降30%），但对通用自然语言理解基准影响很小。文化特定神经元不仅支持目标文化知识，还支持相关文化知识。

Conclusion: 训练自然语言理解基准可能会削弱模型的文化理解能力，特别是当更新包含大量文化通用神经元的模块时。这些发现为理解LLM内部机制和模型训练提供了实用指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed worldwide, ensuring
their fair and comprehensive cultural understanding is important. However, LLMs
exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while
the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To
fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that
drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with
additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general
neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and
culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account
for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP
layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially
degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance
on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely
unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge
of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we
demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural
understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons.
These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer
practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AutoRed是一个无需种子指令的自由形式对抗提示生成框架，通过角色引导的对抗指令生成和反思循环迭代优化提示，显著提高了LLM安全评估的攻击成功率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队测试方法依赖种子指令，限制了合成对抗提示的语义多样性，需要开发更有效的自由形式对抗提示生成方法来评估LLM安全性。

Method: AutoRed采用两阶段框架：1) 角色引导的对抗指令生成；2) 反思循环迭代优化低质量提示。还引入了验证器在不查询目标模型的情况下评估提示危害性。

Result: 构建了AutoRed-Medium和AutoRed-Hard两个红队测试数据集，在八个最先进LLM上评估，AutoRed比现有基线实现了更高的攻击成功率和更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 基于种子的方法存在局限性，自由形式红队测试在LLM安全评估方面具有巨大潜力，将开源数据集促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The safety of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for the development of
trustworthy AI applications. Existing red teaming methods often rely on seed
instructions, which limits the semantic diversity of the synthesized
adversarial prompts. We propose AutoRed, a free-form adversarial prompt
generation framework that removes the need for seed instructions. AutoRed
operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation,
and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve
efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without
querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets --
AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs.
AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than
existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based
approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM
safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.

TL;DR: 提出两阶段投票架构用于自杀风险检测，第一阶段用轻量BERT处理明确案例，第二阶段用LLM投票或基于心理特征的ML集成处理隐晦案例，在效率和准确性上取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀率上升需要主动预防策略，社交媒体提供重要信号，但隐晦自杀意念检测困难，现有轻量模型无法处理隐晦信号，LLM成本过高。

Method: 两阶段架构：第一阶段BERT分类器处理高置信度明确案例；第二阶段对模糊输入使用多视角LLM投票框架或基于LLM提取心理特征的ML集成。

Result: 在两个数据集上表现优异：明确案例F1达98.0%，隐晦案例F1达99.7%，跨域差距低于2%，同时显著降低LLM成本。

Conclusion: 该框架在自杀风险检测中平衡了效率和鲁棒性，是首批将LLM提取的心理特征作为结构化向量用于自杀检测的工作之一。

Abstract: Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent
need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable
signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to
stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit
suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle
emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle
explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models
(LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap,
we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and
robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves
high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to
either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on
implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by
psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for
efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among
the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as
structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets -
explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework
outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7%
on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while
significantly lowering LLM cost.

TL;DR: 本文研究了上下文学习(ICL)中表示和学习两个方面的独立性，发现演示的表示质量决定ICL的基线准确率，而学习能力独立于表示质量存在。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注ICL中演示表示的重要性，但对学习能力的研究结果不一。本文旨在探究表示和学习在ICL中的相互作用关系。

Method: 开发优化算法枚举不同语义相关性的标签集，然后在每个标签集上使用不同数量的上下文演示进行ICL实验。

Result: 学习能力独立于标签集质量存在，但学习效率受标签集质量和语言模型参数规模影响。表示质量的相对优势在学习过程中保持不变。

Conclusion: ICL中的表示和学习具有正交性，表示决定基线性能，学习在此基础上独立发挥作用。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to
learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context.
Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way
these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are
represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the
learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context
demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is
often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between
these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in
depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one
another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline
accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on
top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization
algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets
(representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with
varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We
observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set
itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over
in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the
parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of
learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set
(representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our
hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously
underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from
demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 条件可接受性在沟通和推理中很重要，但之前的研究主要关注LLMs的条件推理能力，不清楚它们如何判断条件语句的可接受性。

Method: 使用线性混合效应模型和ANOVA测试，分析不同模型家族、规模和提示策略下LLMs的条件可接受性判断。

Result: LLMs对条件概率和语义相关性都敏感，但敏感程度因架构和提示风格而异；与人类数据比较显示LLMs使用概率和语义线索不如人类一致；更大模型不一定更接近人类判断。

Conclusion: LLMs在条件可接受性判断中整合了概率和语义信息，但与人类存在系统性差异，模型规模不是改善与人类对齐的关键因素。

Abstract: Conditional acceptability refers to how plausible a conditional statement is
perceived to be. It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as
it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and
make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how
acceptable a conditional "If A, then B" is, their judgments are influenced by
two main factors: the $\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and
the $\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent
$B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has
examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional
statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the
$\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a
comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across
different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear
mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both
conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees
depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data
reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so
less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align
more closely with human judgments.

Motivation: 挑战当前深度学习范式，证明轻量级模型可以在更低的计算成本下实现更好的性能，重新思考规模定律。

Method: 使用单层双头架构的Co⁴模型，参数量仅8M，计算复杂度约为O(N)，相比传统Transformer的O(N²)大幅降低。

Result: 在10M tokens上训练2个epoch就超越GPT-2和GPT-BERT训练10个epoch的结果，在SuperGLUE任务上零样本和微调性能均表现优异。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型具有极高的训练效率和样本效率，需要重新思考深度学习范式和规模定律。

Abstract: We show that a tiny Co$^4$ machine(Adeel,2025) with a single layer, two
heads, and 8M parameters, operating at an approximate cost of $O(N)$ (where $N$
is the number of input tokens), outpaces the BabyLM Challenge baselines GPT-2
(124M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ and GPT-BERT (30M, 12 layers, $O(N^2))$ in just two
epochs, while both are trained for ten. Co$^4$ achieves orders-of-magnitude
greater training efficiency on 10M tokens, demonstrating highly sample
efficient pretraining. Using the BabyLM challenge evaluation pipeline across
complex benchmarks, Co$^4$ exhibits strong zero-shot and fine-tuning
performance on SuperGLUE tasks. Specifically, Co$^4$ outperforms GPT-2 on 5 out
of 7 zero-shot metrics and 6 out of 7 fine-tuning tasks, and GPT-BERT on 4 out
of 7 metrics in both cases. These results suggest the need to rethink
prevailing deep learning paradigms and associated scaling laws.

Motivation: 现有MLRMs存在推理不平衡问题：在简单问题上产生不必要的冗长推理轨迹，而在困难问题上探索不足导致错过解决方案。

Method: 提出两阶段训练流程：1) 自适应冷启动阶段，根据问题难度比例生成推理轨迹；2) 自适应熵策略优化(AEPO)，使用高窗口熵(HWE)标记作为探索触发器，结合分层熵奖励和动态KL控制来决定探索时机和程度。

Result: ARES在多样化数学、逻辑和多模态基准测试中实现了优越的性能和推理效率，在显著降低推理成本的同时缩小了与领先商业系统的差距。

Conclusion: ARES框架通过自适应推理策略有效解决了MLRMs的推理不平衡问题，实现了性能与效率的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large reasoning models (MLRMs) have
substantially improved their ability to solve complex textual and visual tasks.
However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing
unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging
ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES,
a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically
allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is
motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is
noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a
sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii)
reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for
solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage
training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and
textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem
difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the
second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which
uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a
hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to
explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior
performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and
multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems
under significantly lower inference costs.

Motivation: AI模型应训练以识别人类判断中的变异和分歧，并评估其识别能力。LEWIDI系列任务旨在通过提供合适数据集和开发评估方法来促进这种方法。

Result: 任务吸引了多样化参与，结果揭示了建模变异方法的优势和局限性。

Conclusion: 这些贡献加强了LEWIDI作为框架的作用，为开发分歧感知技术提供了新资源、基准和发现。

Abstract: Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained
to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human
judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The
LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to
promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable
datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third
edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to
four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm
detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include
not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments
as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to
evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models
predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist
approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators.
Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested
new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse
participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and
limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions
strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and
findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 并行推理虽然能增强大语言模型的推理能力，但存在严重的计算冗余问题——超过80%的并行推理轨迹产生相同的最终答案，造成大量计算浪费。

Method: 提出DeepPrune框架，包含：1）使用焦点损失和过采样技术训练的专业判断模型，从部分推理轨迹准确预测答案等价性（AUROC达0.87）；2）在线贪心聚类算法，动态剪枝冗余路径同时保持答案多样性。

Result: 在三个挑战性基准测试（AIME 2024、AIME 2025和GPQA）上，DeepPrune相比传统共识采样实现了超过80%的token减少，同时准确率保持在3个百分点以内。

Conclusion: DeepPrune为高效并行推理设立了新标准，使高性能推理更加高效。

Abstract: Parallel scaling has emerged as a powerful paradigm to enhance reasoning
capabilities in large language models (LLMs) by generating multiple
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces simultaneously. However, this approach introduces
significant computational inefficiency due to inter-trace redundancy -- our
analysis reveals that over 80% of parallel reasoning traces yield identical
final answers, representing substantial wasted computation. To address this
critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that
enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features
a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques
to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which
realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy
clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving
answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks
(AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that
DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to
conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive
accuracy within 3 percentage points. Our work establishes a new standard for
efficient parallel reasoning, making high-performance reasoning more efficient.

Motivation: 受人类创造新词来应对新概念需求的启发，探索在LLMs中引入新词汇来更好地理解和控制模型行为。

Method: 通过添加新的词嵌入并训练包含目标概念的示例，不改变其他模型参数，实现新词学习。

Result: 新词可以控制奉承、错误答案、文本长度等概念；模型能自我描述新词含义；发现机器专用同义词；支持多重概念联合学习。

Conclusion: 新词学习是理解和控制LLMs的有效方法，能实现概念控制、自我描述和多重概念学习，为模型理解提供新途径。

Abstract: Humans invent new words when there is a rising demand for a new useful
concept (e.g., doomscrolling). We explore and validate a similar idea in our
communication with LLMs: introducing new words to better understand and control
the models, expanding on the recently introduced neologism learning. This
method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with
examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We
show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery,
incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We
discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via
self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in
natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of
incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful
answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation:
we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it
controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only
synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in
machines. Finally, we show how neologism learning can jointly learn multiple
concepts in multiple words.

Abstract: Prompt optimization aims to systematically refine prompts to enhance a

Service (ToS) clauses is a challenging legal NLP task that demands carefully
crafted prompts to ensure reliable results. However, existing prompt
optimization methods are often computationally expensive due to inefficient
search strategies and costly prompt candidate scoring. In this paper, we
propose a framework that combines Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a proxy
prompt evaluator to more effectively explore the prompt space while reducing
evaluation costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves higher
classification accuracy and efficiency than baseline methods under a
constrained computation budget.

Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法在推理模型上表现不佳：token丢弃方法破坏推理完整性，头重分配方法错误压缩推理关键头，导致性能显著下降。

Method: 使用强化学习直接优化每个头的缓存使用与推理质量的关系，识别推理关键头；对关键头保留完整KV缓存，对其他头应用压缩的常量KV缓存。

Result: 实验表明只有少量注意力头对推理至关重要，该方法在20-50%缓存减少的情况下性能接近无损，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RLKV框架成功识别推理关键头，实现了高效的KV缓存压缩，为推理模型的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through
the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV)
cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods
underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning
integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods
mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for
retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as
compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional
heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought
consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this
insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification
framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the
relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV
produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally
identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV
cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for
efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of
attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression
approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction
with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.

Method: CoMAS通过丰富的讨论动态生成内在奖励，使用LLM作为评判机制来制定这些奖励，并通过强化学习优化每个智能体的策略，实现去中心化和可扩展的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果表明CoMAS持续优于未经训练的智能体，在大多数评估设置中达到最先进性能。消融研究证实了基于交互的奖励信号的必要性，并显示出随着智能体数量和多样性增加的良好可扩展性。

Conclusion: CoMAS为基于LLM的智能体自进化建立了一个新颖且有效的范式。

Abstract: Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model
(LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining.
Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning
(RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense
external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs
themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution
mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve
through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce
Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents
to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without
external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion
dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and
optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and
scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently
outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of
interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number
and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and
effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.

*Qin Liu,Jacob Dineen,Yuxi Huang,Sheng Zhang,Hoifung Poon,Ben Zhou,Muhao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ArenaBencher是一个模型无关的基准测试进化框架，通过自动更新测试用例来解决数据泄露导致的基准测试失效问题，保持测试目标一致性的同时提高难度和模型区分度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练数据泄露导致基准测试失效，模型通过记忆而非真正泛化来匹配内容，这夸大了分数、扭曲了跨模型比较并误导了进展评估。

Method: 给定现有基准和待评估模型池，ArenaBencher推断每个测试案例的核心能力，生成保留原始目标的候选问答对，使用LLM作为裁判验证正确性和意图，并聚合多个模型的反馈来选择暴露共同弱点的候选案例。

Result: 在数学问题解决、常识推理和安全领域应用显示，ArenaBencher能产生经过验证、多样化且公平的更新，发现新的失败模式，在保持测试目标一致性的同时增加难度，并提高模型区分度。

Conclusion: 该框架为基准测试随着基础模型快速发展而持续进化提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Benchmarks are central to measuring the capabilities of large language models
and guiding model development, yet widespread data leakage from pretraining
corpora undermines their validity. Models can match memorized content rather
than demonstrate true generalization, which inflates scores, distorts
cross-model comparisons, and misrepresents progress. We introduce ArenaBencher,
a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test
cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse
pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each
test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original
objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and
aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose
shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations
that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply
ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains
and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new
failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment,
and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to
continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation
models.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SpotDiff是一种新的基于学习的个性化图像生成方法，通过发现和解缠干扰来提取特定主题特征，在保持主题身份的同时实现高效可控的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法计算成本高，而学习方法虽然高效但受干扰因素影响导致特征纠缠，需要一种既能保持高保真度又高效的方法。

Method: 利用预训练的CLIP图像编码器和专门的姿态、背景专家网络，通过特征空间正交性约束来隔离主题身份，并构建SpotDiff10k数据集进行训练。

Result: SpotDiff在主题保持和可控编辑方面比现有方法更鲁棒，仅用10k训练样本就达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: SpotDiff通过特征解缠实现了高效且鲁棒的个性化图像生成，在保真度和可控性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference
subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing
optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally
expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of
entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce
SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features
by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image
encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff
isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature
space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated
dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate
that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable
editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only
10k training samples.

*Shaorong Zhang,Rob Brekelmans,Greg Ver Steeg*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS)框架，通过沿扩散轨迹迭代求解局部MAP子问题，为基于优化的扩散求解器提供统一的概率解释，并在多个图像恢复任务中实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，DPS从后验分布采样，但逆问题求解的目标是获得最准确的重建，而基于优化的扩散求解器虽然缺乏明确的概率基础，却往往表现更好。需要为这些方法提供统一的概率解释。

Method: 引入LMAPS框架，迭代求解扩散轨迹上的局部MAP子问题；开发了概率可解释的协方差近似、重新制定的目标函数以提高稳定性和可解释性，以及针对不可微算子的梯度近似。

Result: 在广泛的图像恢复和科学任务中，LMAPS实现了最先进的性能：运动去模糊、JPEG恢复和量化任务上获得≥2dB增益，逆散射基准上获得>1.5dB改进。

Conclusion: LMAPS为基于优化的扩散求解器提供了统一的概率解释，并在多个逆问题上显著优于现有方法，建立了扩散轨迹上局部MAP估计与全局MAP估计和DPS之间的明确联系。

Abstract: Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) provides a principled Bayesian approach to
inverse problems by sampling from $p(x_0 \mid y)$. However, in practice, the
goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover
the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers
often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce
Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving
local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective
clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified
probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this
foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically
interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability
and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable
operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS
achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\geq 2$ dB gains on motion
deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on
inverse scattering benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可变字体在创意应用中未被充分利用，艺术家仍需手动调整字体参数。本文旨在开发直观自动的字体设计和动画工作流，平衡文本可读性、美学和创意表达。

Method: 将可变字体规范转化为紧凑数学公式，建立可微分框架，通过梯度优化在矢量图形控制点和目标栅格化图像上定义的能量函数。

Result: 开发了四个应用：直接形状操作、重叠感知建模、基于物理的文本动画和自动字体设计优化，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作使得能够利用可变字体的精心设计特性与可微分性，结合现代设计优化技术，为简单直观的排版设计工作流开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Editing and animating text appearance for graphic designs, commercials, etc.
remain highly skilled tasks requiring detailed, hands on efforts from artists.
Automating these manual workflows requires balancing the competing goals of
maintaining legibility and aesthetics of text, while enabling creative
expression. Variable fonts, recent parametric extensions to traditional fonts,
offer the promise of new ways to ease and automate typographic design and
animation. Variable fonts provide custom constructed parameters along which
fonts can be smoothly varied. These parameterizations could then potentially
serve as high value continuous design spaces, opening the door to automated
design optimization tools. However, currently variable fonts are underutilized
in creative applications, because artists so far still need to manually tune
font parameters. Our work opens the door to intuitive and automated font design
and animation workflows with differentiable variable fonts. To do so we distill
the current variable font specification to a compact mathematical formulation
that differentiably connects the highly non linear, non invertible mapping of
variable font parameters to the underlying vector graphics representing the
text. This enables us to construct a differentiable framework, with respect to
variable font parameters, allowing us to perform gradient based optimization of
energies defined on vector graphics control points, and on target rasterized
images. We demonstrate the utility of this framework with four applications:
direct shape manipulation, overlap aware modeling, physics based text
animation, and automated font design optimization. Our work now enables
leveraging the carefully designed affordances of variable fonts with
differentiability to use modern design optimization technologies, opening new
possibilities for easy and intuitive typographic design workflows.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一个专为波前路径追踪设计的俄罗斯轮盘赌与分裂(RRS)框架，通过归一化RRS公式和神经网络学习RRS因子，解决了传统RRS方法与波前架构的内存预分配和调度需求不兼容的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RRS方法由于路径数量不可预测，与波前路径追踪的高度并行、批处理架构不兼容，无法满足其预分配内存和调度需求。

Method: 引入归一化RRS公式确保路径数量有界；提出NRRS和AID-NRRS两种神经网络模型学习RRS因子；设计Mix-Depth机制根据路径深度自适应调节神经评估。

Result: 在各种复杂场景下，该方法在渲染质量和性能方面均优于传统启发式方法和最近的RRS技术。

Conclusion: 提出的归一化RRS框架成功解决了波前路径追踪中RRS应用的兼容性问题，通过神经网络学习显著提升了渲染效率和质量。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for Russian Roulette and Splitting (RRS)
tailored to wavefront path tracing, a highly parallel rendering architecture
that processes path states in batched, stage-wise execution for efficient GPU
utilization. Traditional RRS methods, with unpredictable path counts, are
fundamentally incompatible with wavefront's preallocated memory and scheduling
requirements. To resolve this, we introduce a normalized RRS formulation with a
bounded path count, enabling stable and memory-efficient execution.
  Furthermore, we pioneer the use of neural networks to learn RRS factors,
presenting two models: NRRS and AID-NRRS. At a high level, both feature a
carefully designed RRSNet that explicitly incorporates RRS normalization, with
only subtle differences in their implementation. To balance computational cost
and inference accuracy, we introduce Mix-Depth, a path-depth-aware mechanism
that adaptively regulates neural evaluation, further improving efficiency.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional
heuristics and recent RRS techniques in both rendering quality and performance
across a variety of complex scenes.

*Elias Kristmann,Markus Schütz,Michael Wimmer*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 研究在现代GPU上使用JPEG格式进行可变速率纹理压缩的可行性，并与固定速率压缩方法BC1和ASTC进行比较


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然可变速率压缩图像格式如JPEG被广泛用于高效编码图像，但由于需要随机访问单个纹理像素等特殊要求，它们尚未在实时渲染中得到应用

Method: 使用延迟渲染管线，识别给定帧所需的块子集，解码这些块并为帧缓冲区的像素着色

Result: 尽管需要额外的约0.17位每像素，JPEG相比BC1保持了显著更好的质量和压缩率，根据图像类型，表现优于或与ASTC竞争。在RTX 4090上，JPEG渲染管线仅增加不到0.3毫秒的渲染时间

Conclusion: 复杂的可变速率压缩方案在现代GPU上是可行的，即使在VR环境中也能实现

Abstract: Although variable-rate compressed image formats such as JPEG are widely used
to efficiently encode images, they have not found their way into real-time
rendering due to special requirements such as random access to individual
texels. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of variable-rate texture
compression on modern GPUs using the JPEG format, and how it compares to the
GPU-friendly fixed-rate compression approaches BC1 and ASTC. Using a deferred
rendering pipeline, we are able to identify the subset of blocks that are
needed for a given frame, decode these, and colorize the framebuffer's pixels.
Despite the additional $\sim$0.17 bit per pixel that we require for our
approach, JPEG maintains significantly better quality and compression rates
compared to BC1, and depending on the type of image, outperforms or competes
with ASTC. The JPEG rendering pipeline increases rendering duration by less
than 0.3 ms on an RTX 4090, demonstrating that sophisticated variable-rate
compression schemes are feasible on modern GPUs, even in VR. Source code and

TL;DR: SViM3D是一个从单张图像预测多视角一致的物理渲染(PBR)材质的框架，通过扩展潜在视频扩散模型来联合输出PBR参数和法线，实现可重光照的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么使用简单的材质模型表示反射率，要么需要额外步骤来估计反射率以实现重光照和可控外观编辑。

Method: 扩展潜在视频扩散模型，基于显式相机控制联合输出空间变化的PBR参数和表面法线，并引入多种机制来改善这个病态设置下的质量。

Result: 在多个以物体为中心的数据集上展示了最先进的重光照和新视角合成性能，能够泛化到多样化的输入。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成适用于AR/VR、电影、游戏等视觉媒体的可重光照3D资产。

Abstract: We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict
multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a
single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to
reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is
still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in
additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We
extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR
parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on
explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating
a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to
this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show
state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple
object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the
generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other
visual media.

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化神经场的方法，使其能够通过单次前向传播进行预滤波，支持多种参数化滤波器且无需额外网络架构约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经场在表示连续视觉信号方面表现出色，但通常只能在单一固定分辨率下运行，缺乏灵活的多分辨率处理能力。

Method: 在输入域进行卷积滤波，通过分析性地缩放傅里叶特征嵌入与滤波器的频率响应；使用单样本蒙特卡洛估计训练神经场。

Result: 在神经场滤波方面取得了定量和定性的改进，训练和推理速度快，支持训练时未见过的参数化滤波器。

Conclusion: 该方法简单而强大，能够高效实现神经场的多分辨率滤波，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Neural fields excel at representing continuous visual signals but typically
operate at a single, fixed resolution. We present a simple yet powerful method
to optimize neural fields that can be prefiltered in a single forward pass. Key
innovations and features include: (1) We perform convolutional filtering in the
input domain by analytically scaling Fourier feature embeddings with the
filter's frequency response. (2) This closed-form modulation generalizes beyond
Gaussian filtering and supports other parametric filters (Box and Lanczos) that
are unseen at training time. (3) We train the neural field using single-sample
Monte Carlo estimates of the filtered signal. Our method is fast during both
training and inference, and imposes no additional constraints on the network
architecture. We show quantitative and qualitative improvements over existing
methods for neural-field filtering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有辐射场表示方法的局限性：神经辐射场表达能力强但渲染成本高，3D高斯拼接渲染效率高但表达能力有限。

Method: 使用有界的神经密度场作为基元，每个基元由浅层神经网络参数化，支持精确的解析线积分计算，无需光线行进即可实现透视准确的拼接核。

Result: 在新视角合成基准测试中，匹配了3D高斯拼接的质量和速度，同时使用了10倍少的基元和6倍少的参数。

Conclusion: 该表示方法直接实现了表达能力和效率的平衡，无需依赖复杂的控制或适配框架，为3D场景建模提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have emerged as a predominant representation for modeling 3D
scene appearance. Neural formulations such as Neural Radiance Fields provide
high expressivity but require costly ray marching for rendering, whereas
primitive-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting offer real-time
efficiency through splatting, yet at the expense of representational power.
Inspired by advances in both these directions, we introduce splattable neural
primitives, a new volumetric representation that reconciles the expressivity of
neural models with the efficiency of primitive-based splatting. Each primitive
encodes a bounded neural density field parameterized by a shallow neural
network. Our formulation admits an exact analytical solution for line
integrals, enabling efficient computation of perspectively accurate splatting
kernels. As a result, our representation supports integration along view rays
without the need for costly ray marching. The primitives flexibly adapt to
scene geometry and, being larger than prior analytic primitives, reduce the
number required per scene. On novel-view synthesis benchmarks, our approach
matches the quality and speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting while using $10\times$
fewer primitives and $6\times$ fewer parameters. These advantages arise
directly from the representation itself, without reliance on complex control or
adaptation frameworks. The project page is

TL;DR: X2Video是首个基于内在通道（反照率、法线、粗糙度、金属度、辐照度）引导的扩散模型，能够生成逼真视频，同时支持参考图像和文本提示的多模态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型缺乏对内在通道的精确控制，无法准确操纵颜色、材质、几何和光照。X2Video旨在通过内在通道指导和多模态控制来解决这一问题。

Method: 扩展XRGB图像生成模型到视频生成，采用混合自注意力确保时间一致性，使用掩码交叉注意力分离全局和局部文本提示，并通过递归采样方法生成长视频。

Result: X2Video能够生成长时间一致、逼真的视频，有效支持多模态控制，包括参考图像、全局和局部文本提示，以及通过参数调整进行颜色、材质、几何和光照编辑。

Conclusion: X2Video通过内在通道指导和多模态控制，实现了高质量视频生成，在定性和定量评估中均表现出色，为视频生成和编辑提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We present X2Video, the first diffusion model for rendering photorealistic
videos guided by intrinsic channels including albedo, normal, roughness,
metallicity, and irradiance, while supporting intuitive multi-modal controls
with reference images and text prompts for both global and local regions. The
intrinsic guidance allows accurate manipulation of color, material, geometry,
and lighting, while reference images and text prompts provide intuitive
adjustments in the absence of intrinsic information. To enable these
functionalities, we extend the intrinsic-guided image generation model XRGB to
video generation by employing a novel and efficient Hybrid Self-Attention,
which ensures temporal consistency across video frames and also enhances
fidelity to reference images. We further develop a Masked Cross-Attention to
disentangle global and local text prompts, applying them effectively onto
respective local and global regions. For generating long videos, our novel
Recursive Sampling method incorporates progressive frame sampling, combining
keyframe prediction and frame interpolation to maintain long-range temporal
consistency while preventing error accumulation. To support the training of
X2Video, we assembled a video dataset named InteriorVideo, featuring 1,154
rooms from 295 interior scenes, complete with reliable ground-truth intrinsic
channel sequences and smooth camera trajectories. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations demonstrate that X2Video can produce long, temporally
consistent, and photorealistic videos guided by intrinsic conditions.
Additionally, X2Video effectively accommodates multi-modal controls with
reference images, global and local text prompts, and simultaneously supports
editing on color, material, geometry, and lighting through parametric tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络语言生成与知识库的对齐问题，减少模型幻觉，同时不牺牲生成效率。

Method: 基于概率程序语义学，在指令调优系统中加入语义防护格，包括约束语义、贪婪选择证明、熵式不变量和多智能体操作演算。

Result: 实验证实防护机制能有效减少幻觉，保持吞吐量，为大规模经验模型与形式验证提供实用桥梁。

Conclusion: TAD为语言模型提供了形式验证的解码方案，在减少幻觉与保持效率之间取得平衡。

Abstract: This paper introduces Truth-Aware Decoding (TAD), a verification-oriented
decoding scheme that aligns neural language generation with knowledge bases.
Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence
models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of
semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold:
(i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a
program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local
likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an
entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe
mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts
to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies
confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing
throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models
and formal verification.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: L2M-AID是一个基于LLM增强多智能体强化学习的自主工业防御框架，通过融合LLM语义理解和MARL协作策略，显著提升工业物联网安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业防御系统缺乏上下文感知能力，难以应对复杂的多阶段攻击。工业物联网的普及使关键网络物理系统面临更严峻的安全挑战。

Method: 使用LLM作为语义桥梁，将非结构化遥测数据转换为丰富的上下文状态表示；采用多智能体强化学习算法MAPPO学习协作策略；设计平衡安全目标与操作需求的奖励函数。

Result: 在SWaT数据集和基于MITRE ATT&CK的合成数据集上，检测率达到97.2%，误报率降低80%以上，响应时间提升4倍，同时保持物理过程稳定性。

Conclusion: L2M-AID为保护关键国家基础设施提供了一个强大的新范式，在检测性能、误报控制和过程稳定性方面均优于传统方法。

Abstract: The increasing integration of Industrial IoT (IIoT) exposes critical
cyber-physical systems to sophisticated, multi-stage attacks that elude
traditional defenses lacking contextual awareness. This paper introduces
L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using
LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team
of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to
achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep
fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to
translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state
representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than
merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative
strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security
objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly
penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a
novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework.
Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS,
deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key
metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by
over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it
demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability,
presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究思考模型（如DeepSeek R1）是否学习全新推理能力，还是重新利用基础模型已有的能力。

Method: 提出混合模型，在基础模型中适时激活推理机制；引入无监督、自下而上的方法揭示思考模型中的可解释推理行为。

Result: 在三个基础模型和四个思考模型上，混合模型无需权重更新就能恢复高达91%的性能差距，仅引导12%的token。

Conclusion: 预训练阶段模型已获得大部分推理机制，后训练阶段教会模型在适当时机高效部署这些机制，实现推理计算的高效利用。

Abstract: Why do thinking language models like DeepSeek R1 outperform their base
counterparts? Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what
extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose
pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we
activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit
thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit
already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an
unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning
behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to
discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived
assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and
MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking
models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens.
Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the
effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them
directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these
results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained:
pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and
post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right

### [213] [Position: AI Will Transform Neuropsychology Through Mental Health Digital Twins for Dynamic Mental Health Care, Especially for ADHD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07409)
*Neil Natarajan,Sruthi Viswanathan,Xavier Roberts-Gaal,Michelle Marie Martel*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出从静态心理健康诊断转向AI驱动的连续评估，以ADHD为例探讨生成式AI如何解决神经心理学能力限制，实现个性化和纵向护理路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态解决方案无法满足动态思维需求，当前心理健康诊断存在能力限制，需要更个性化和连续的护理方法。

Method: 使用生成式AI进行频繁、低水平的经验采样，促进跨护理路径的诊断协调，并引入心理健康数字孪生(MHDTs)作为持续更新的计算模型。

Result: AI能够高效进行患者经验采样，为个性化心理健康护理提供丰富数据基础。

Conclusion: 心理健康护理未来将从连续、丰富、以患者为中心的数据采样中受益，动态适应个体需求和变化条件，提高治疗的可及性和有效性。

Abstract: Static solutions don't serve a dynamic mind. Thus, we advocate a shift from
static mental health diagnostic assessments to continuous, artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven assessment. Focusing on
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as a case study, we explore how
generative AI has the potential to address current capacity constraints in
neuropsychology, potentially enabling more personalized and longitudinal care
pathways. In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level
experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation
across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits
from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt
to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both
accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental
health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that
capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative
framework for personalized mental health care. We ground this framework in
empirical evidence and map out the research agenda required to refine and
operationalize it.

TL;DR: ProSEA是一个模块化多智能体框架，通过探索和计划演进实现迭代问题解决，在FinanceBench基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体大多局限于静态规划和脆弱交互，缺乏真正的协作或自适应推理能力。

Method: 采用分层架构，由管理器智能体协调领域专家智能体，分解任务并根据失败尝试的结构化反馈进行自适应重规划。

Result: 在FinanceBench基准测试中，即使没有人类反馈，ProSEA也优于最先进的基线方法，在推理密集型任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: ProSEA有潜力成为更透明、自适应且与人类对齐的AI智能体的基础框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have empowered AI agents to tackle increasingly
complex tasks. However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning
and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive
reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent
framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan
evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent
orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively
replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior
systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed
reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan
refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously
but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed.
Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA,
even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results
underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive,
and human-aligned AI agents.

TL;DR: TESTAM+是一个增强的时空预测框架，通过引入新的SpatioSemantic专家，将物理道路拓扑与数据驱动的特征相似性相结合，显著提升了交通预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家框架如TESTAM缺乏对物理道路网络拓扑的显式整合，限制了其空间建模能力。

Method: 提出TESTAM+框架，引入SpatioSemantic专家，通过混合图构建整合物理道路拓扑和数据驱动特征相似性，并采用策略性专家选择而非简单集成。

Result: 在METR LA上MAE降低1.3%(3.10 vs 3.14)，PEMS BAY上提升4.1%(1.65 vs 1.72)。最佳配置相比MegaCRN在METR LA上MAE降低11.5%(2.99 vs 3.38)，推理延迟比完整四专家TESTAM+减少53.1%。

Conclusion: 更少但策略性设计的专家优于复杂的多专家集成，在实现最先进性能的同时具有更优的计算效率，适合实时部署。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is fundamental to intelligent transportation systems,
enabling congestion mitigation and emission reduction in increasingly complex
urban environments. While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced
spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time
Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation
of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We
present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that
introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology
with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+
achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA
(3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection
fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts
demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on
PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the
SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The
optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction
compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing
inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our
findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex
multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with
superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TS-Agent是一个时间序列推理代理，通过将LLMs的证据收集和推理能力与时间序列分析工具相结合，避免将时间序列转换为文本、图像或嵌入，而是直接处理原始数值序列，从而减少幻觉和知识泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在时间序列推理任务中表现不佳，容易产生幻觉或知识泄漏，需要一种能够充分利用LLMs优势同时避免其缺陷的方法。

Method: 设计TS-Agent，使用原子操作符直接处理原始时间序列数据，记录证据日志，通过自批评和最终质量门控迭代优化推理过程，避免多模态对齐训练。

Result: 在基准测试中，TS-Agent在理解任务上达到最先进LLMs水平，在推理任务上显著优于现有模型，特别是在零样本设置下表现突出。

Conclusion: TS-Agent通过将LLMs严格限定在证据收集和推理合成角色，同时利用专门的时间序列分析工具，有效解决了时间序列推理中的幻觉和知识泄漏问题，实现了可解释和可验证的推理过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and
problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time
series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or
knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning
agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering
evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning,
while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to
time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens,
images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through
atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively
refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality
gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native
form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates
knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on
established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance
comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers
significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely
on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.

Motivation: 探索LLM在交互式对话中理解流程模型、发现语法和逻辑错误，并通过自然语言界面进行深度推理的能力。

Method: 使用多个LLM（包括ChatGPT o3模型）在零样本设置下测试其对BPMN流程模型图像的理解能力，并进行经验分析。

Result: 未经训练的LLM能够有效理解BPMN流程模型，并在语法、逻辑和语义层面智能回答问题。不同LLM性能存在差异，但都显示出作为业务流程助手的价值。LLM在流程分析和优化中表现出类似人类的推理能力。

Conclusion: LLM可以作为业务流程设计者和用户的有价值助手，具备理解流程模型和进行深度推理的能力，并表现出拟人化特性。

Abstract: In this paper, we report our experience with several LLMs for their ability
to understand a process model in an interactive, conversational style, find
syntactical and logical errors in it, and reason with it in depth through a
natural language (NL) interface. Our findings show that a vanilla, untrained
LLM like ChatGPT (model o3) in a zero-shot setting is effective in
understanding BPMN process models from images and answering queries about them
intelligently at syntactic, logic, and semantic levels of depth. Further,
different LLMs vary in performance in terms of their accuracy and
effectiveness. Nevertheless, our empirical analysis shows that LLMs can play a
valuable role as assistants for business process designers and users. We also
study the LLM's "thought process" and ability to perform deeper reasoning in
the context of process analysis and optimization. We find that the LLMs seem to
exhibit anthropomorphic properties.

Motivation: 医疗智能系统被欧盟AI法案归类为高风险系统，需要进行正式的风险管理以确保符合可信AI的伦理要求。

Method: 将风险降低优化问题形式化为约束优化任务，使用混合整数规划、可满足性和约束编程三种方法求解，并用Minizinc建模语言实现。

Result: 通过实验研究比较了三种方法的性能、表达能力和可扩展性，识别了方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了将Minizinc模型集成到完整可信AI伦理风险管理流程中的工作展望。

Abstract: Medical Intelligent Systems (MIS) are increasingly integrated into healthcare
workflows, offering significant benefits but also raising critical safety and
ethical concerns. According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be
classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to
ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this
context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce
risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of
risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical
requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and
investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP),
Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include
the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with
the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study
that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach
to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some
perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into
a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CompassLLM是一个基于大语言模型的多智能体框架，用于从历史轨迹数据中发现热门路径，通过搜索和生成两阶段流程解决传统方法需要模型训练和参数调优的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统热门路径查询方法需要模型训练、参数调优和数据更新时的重新训练，而大语言模型在空间和图推理方面展现出强大能力，因此探索如何将LLMs应用于地理空间问题具有重要意义。

Method: CompassLLM采用多智能体框架，包含两阶段流程：SEARCH阶段识别热门路径，GENERATE阶段在历史轨迹数据中不存在路径时合成新路径。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，CompassLLM在SEARCH阶段表现出优越的准确性，在GENERATE阶段具有竞争性性能，同时成本效益高。

Conclusion: CompassLLM成功将LLMs的推理能力应用于地理空间领域，为解决热门路径查询问题提供了一种无需模型训练的有效方法。

Abstract: The popular path query - identifying the most frequented routes between
locations from historical trajectory data - has important applications in urban
planning, navigation optimization, and travel recommendations. While
traditional algorithms and machine learning approaches have achieved success in
this domain, they typically require model training, parameter tuning, and
retraining when accommodating data updates. As Large Language Models (LLMs)
demonstrate increasing capabilities in spatial and graph-based reasoning, there
is growing interest in exploring how these models can be applied to geo-spatial
problems.
  We introduce CompassLLM, a novel multi-agent framework that intelligently
leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into the geo-spatial domain to
solve the popular path query. CompassLLM employs its agents in a two-stage
pipeline: the SEARCH stage that identifies popular paths, and a GENERATE stage
that synthesizes novel paths in the absence of an existing one in the
historical trajectory data. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show
that CompassLLM demonstrates superior accuracy in SEARCH and competitive
performance in GENERATE while being cost-effective.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning
by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions.
Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to
identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view
or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability
of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins
sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First,
we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update
process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity
markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish "self" from "peer", which
forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define
the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how
often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple
models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread,
with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need
to "mask" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather
than source identity. Code is released in
https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/MAD-identity-bias.

Motivation: 当前AI评估存在数据污染、选择性报告、质量管控不足等问题，导致难以区分真实进展与夸大宣传，侵蚀公众信任，迫切需要可信赖的评估范式。

Method: 提出PeerBench框架，采用社区治理、密封执行、题库银行与滚动更新、延迟透明度等机制来构建稳健的评估体系。

Conclusion: 当前放任自流的AI评估方式不可持续，需要向统一、受控的基准测试范式转变，PeerBench为此提供了可行的技术路径。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding
market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical
challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm
for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical
vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by
model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to
biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific
approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this "Wild West" of
assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims
exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes
public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets
reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's.
  In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is
devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating
AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues
that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true,
sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and
quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere
courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining
today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation
of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored
evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item
banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency. Our goal is to pave the
way for evaluations that can restore integrity and deliver genuinely
trustworthy measures of AI progress.

TL;DR: AgentAsk是一个轻量级即插即用的澄清模块，通过在智能体间消息传递时插入必要问题来阻止错误传播，显著提升多智能体系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于大语言模型的多智能体系统通过分工协作有望增强问题解决能力，但常因边缘级错误级联（微小错误在消息传递中传播）而表现不如单智能体基线。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：从失败轨迹中提取边缘级判断形成紧凑策略，监督策略决定何时/问什么/问谁/如何问，使用E-GRPO强化学习目标在线优化以平衡准确性、延迟和成本。

Result: 在数学、推理和编程基准测试中，AgentAsk持续提升公共多智能体实现的准确性和鲁棒性，同时保持最小开销（延迟和额外成本均低于5%），接近强评估器性能。

Conclusion: 除了经验改进外，本文贡献了边缘级错误的系统分类和链路局部干预的实用方法，为构建更可靠的基于LLM的多智能体系统提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on large language models (LLMs) promise enhanced
problem-solving capabilities through collaborative division of labor. However,
they frequently underperform single-agent baselines due to edge-level error
cascades: minor inaccuracies at one message handoff propagate across the entire
chain. We propose AgentAsk, a lightweight and plug-and-play clarification
module that treats every inter-agent message as a potential failure point and
inserts minimally necessary questions to arrest error propagation. AgentAsk
follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from
curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to
determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a
reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The
module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing
orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk
consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent
implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all
less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator. Beyond
empirical improvements, we contribute a principled taxonomy of edge-level
errors and a practical recipe for link-local intervention, offering a scalable
pathway toward more reliable LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于LLM的顺序多智能体系统难以信任，因为错误会从一个阶段悄悄传递到下一个阶段，缺乏透明度和问责机制。

Method: 采用Planner -> Executor -> Critic三层流水线架构，评估了8种配置的三种先进LLM在三个基准测试上的表现，分析错误起源、传播和修复机制。

Result: 结构化问责交接显著提高准确性并防止简单流水线中的常见故障；模型具有明确的角色特定优势和风险；准确性-成本-延迟权衡是任务依赖的，异构流水线通常最有效。

Conclusion: 提供了一种实用的数据驱动方法来设计、追踪和调试可靠、可预测和可问责的多智能体系统。

Abstract: Sequential multi-agent systems built with large language models (LLMs) can
automate complex software tasks, but they are hard to trust because errors
quietly pass from one stage to the next. We study a traceable and accountable
pipeline, meaning a system with clear roles, structured handoffs, and saved
records that let us trace who did what at each step and assign blame when
things go wrong. Our setting is a Planner -> Executor -> Critic pipeline. We
evaluate eight configurations of three state-of-the-art LLMs on three
benchmarks and analyze where errors start, how they spread, and how they can be
fixed. Our results show: (1) adding a structured, accountable handoff between
agents markedly improves accuracy and prevents the failures common in simple
pipelines; (2) models have clear role-specific strengths and risks (e.g.,
steady planning vs. high-variance critiquing), which we quantify with repair
and harm rates; and (3) accuracy-cost-latency trade-offs are task-dependent,
with heterogeneous pipelines often the most efficient. Overall, we provide a
practical, data-driven method for designing, tracing, and debugging reliable,
predictable, and accountable multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is transforming
healthcare. With this evolution comes optimism regarding the impact it will
have on mental health, as well as concern regarding the risks that come with
generative AI operating in the mental health domain. Much of the investment in,
and academic and public discourse about, AI-powered solutions for mental health
has focused on therapist chatbots. Despite the common assumption that chatbots
will be the most impactful application of GenAI to mental health, we make the
case here for a lower-risk, high impact use case: leveraging generative AI to
enhance and scale training in mental health service provision. We highlight key
benefits of using generative AI to help train people to provide mental health
services and present a real-world case study in which generative AI improved
the training of veterans to support one another's mental health. With numerous
potential applications of generative AI in mental health, we illustrate why we
should invest in using generative AI to support training people in mental
health service provision.

Abstract: Frontier AI models have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent studies
suggest they struggle with compositional reasoning, often performing at or
below random chance on established benchmarks. We revisit this problem and show
that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model
capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better
exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both
contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test
time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard
evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables
SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first
result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground.
  Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative,
self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any
external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for
example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a
new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on
benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving
relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16
dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM
consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of
compositional reasoning.

*Haruka Kiyohara,Yusuke Narita,Yuta Saito,Kei Tateno,Takuma Udagawa*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Safe OPG方法解决推荐系统中新物品的安全探索问题，并通过Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning框架在保证安全的前提下实现有效探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实推荐系统中新物品频繁加入，现有离线策略学习方法在新物品存在时不够安全，需要开发既能保证安全又能探索新物品的框架。

Method: 开发Safe OPG（基于高置信度离线策略评估的模型无关安全OPL方法），并提出Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning框架，利用安全边际并在多次部署中逐步放松安全正则化。

Result: Safe OPG几乎总能满足安全要求，但过于保守；新框架能在保证推荐系统安全实施的同时探索新物品。

Conclusion: 提出的框架解决了安全保证与新物品探索之间的权衡问题，实现了推荐系统的安全有效探索。

Abstract: In many real recommender systems, novel items are added frequently over time.
The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been
acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on
Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data,
however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions.
Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with
a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy
Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high
confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe
OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods
violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be
too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety
and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel
framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User
Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety
regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus
enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of
recommender systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个可复现的仿真框架，用于评估多模态环境中生成式智能体的安全性、连贯性和信任度，发现当前智能体在纠正不安全计划方面成功率仅为55%，且容易过度信任误导性图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言和视觉语言模型使智能体能够在丰富环境中自主行动，但它们在跨模态安全性、连贯性和信任推理方面的能力仍然有限，需要系统评估。

Method: 开发了可复现的仿真框架，配备分层记忆、动态规划、多模态感知能力，并使用SocialMetrics行为指标套件量化计划修订、不安全到安全的转换以及网络信息扩散。

Result: 实验显示智能体在多模态矛盾检测方面表现良好，但在将局部修订与全局安全对齐方面失败，不安全计划纠正成功率仅55%。Claude、GPT-4o mini和Qwen-VL的转换率分别为75%、55%和58%。45%的不安全行为在误导性视觉信息下被接受。

Conclusion: 当前架构在多模态安全方面存在关键限制，该框架为研究多模态安全性、连贯性和社交动态提供了可复现平台。

Abstract: Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.

*Xiaochen Tang,Zhenya Zhang,Miaomiao Zhang,Jie An*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于STL在线因果监控的奖励生成方法，通过在每个控制步骤持续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，计算满足或违反的定量距离，从而产生反映瞬时状态动态的奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将STL奖励函数纳入RL时，自动推断的奖励代表整个或部分路径的全局评估，但无法准确累积局部变化的奖励，稀疏的全局奖励可能导致不收敛和不稳定的训练性能。

Method: 采用在线因果监控方法，在每个控制步骤持续监控系统行为与STL规范的符合程度，提供因果语义的平滑近似以克服不连续性，使其适用于深度RL方法。

Result: 在Gym环境中的各种连续控制基准测试中，实验结果表明该方法优于现有的相关STL引导RL方法，为深度RL提供了更鲁棒和高效的奖励生成框架。

Conclusion: 基于STL在线因果语义的RL方法能够提供更有效的奖励信号，改善训练收敛性和稳定性，在实时安全关键系统中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control
synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and
correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal
temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing
real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of
system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important
method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent
studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically
synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards
obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial
path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the
sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training
performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method
guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously
monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step,
computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and
thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics.
Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to
overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it
differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool
and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled
benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method
with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL
methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for
deep-RL.

TL;DR: 提出了oMeBench，首个大规模、专家策划的有机化学反应机理推理基准，包含超过10,000个带注释的机理步骤，并开发了oMeS评估框架来精确评估LLMs的化学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在化学任务中表现出潜力，但尚不清楚其是否具备真正的化学推理能力，包括生成有效中间体、保持化学一致性和遵循逻辑连贯的多步骤路径。

Method: 构建oMeBench基准数据集，包含10,000+带注释的机理步骤；提出oMeS动态评估框架，结合步骤级逻辑和化学相似性进行细粒度评分；分析最先进LLMs的性能。

Result: 当前模型显示出有前景的化学直觉，但在正确和一致的多步骤推理方面存在困难；通过提示策略和在数据集上微调专家模型，性能比领先闭源模型提高了50%。

Conclusion: oMeBench为推进AI系统实现真正的化学推理提供了严谨基础，当前模型在化学推理方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Organic reaction mechanisms are the stepwise elementary reactions by which
reactants form intermediates and products, and are fundamental to understanding
chemical reactivity and designing new molecules and reactions. Although large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such
as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine
chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid
intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent
multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first
large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in
organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with
intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate
LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS,
a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical
similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our
results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition,
they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we
find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our
proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source
model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing
AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.

TL;DR: SurveyG是一个基于LLM的智能体框架，通过整合层次化引用图来生成更全面、结构更好的综述论文，解决了现有方法忽视论文间结构关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的综述生成方法通常直接从大量相关论文中提取内容并总结，但忽视了论文间的结构关系，导致生成的综述缺乏连贯的分类体系和深层上下文理解。

Method: 提出SurveyG框架，整合层次化引用图（包含基础层、发展层和前沿层），通过水平搜索和垂直深度遍历生成多级摘要，并采用多智能体验证确保一致性、覆盖面和事实准确性。

Result: 实验表明，SurveyG在人类专家和LLM作为评判者的评估中优于现有最先进框架，生成的综述更全面且更好地符合领域知识分类体系。

Conclusion: SurveyG通过整合结构化知识显著提升了自动综述生成的质量，为LLM在学术文献分析中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for automating survey
paper generation \cite{wang2406autosurvey, liang2025surveyx,
yan2025surveyforge,su2025benchmarking,wen2025interactivesurvey}. Existing
approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers
and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often
overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated
surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of
research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textbf{SurveyG},
an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \textit{hierarchical citation
graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation
dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding
structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The
graph is organized into three layers: \textbf{Foundation},
\textbf{Development}, and \textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of
research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By
combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across
layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a
structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures
consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey.
Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge,
demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing
surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying
knowledge taxonomy of a field.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MMIA是一种基于大语言模型的医疗智能代理架构，通过形式化可验证的推理过程确保可靠性，在医疗管理任务中实现超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗领域存在事实和逻辑错误问题，这在高风险医疗环境中不可接受，需要开发可靠的AI系统。

Method: MMIA将复杂医疗任务递归分解为原子化、基于证据的步骤，通过自动审计推理链的逻辑一致性和证据可追溯性来确保可靠性，并采用'引导'模式将已验证推理链存储为'定理'，后续任务使用检索增强生成(RAG)高效解决。

Result: 在四个医疗管理领域的验证中，MMIA实现了超过98%的错误检测率和低于1%的误报率，显著优于基线LLM。RAG匹配模式预计可将平均处理成本降低约85%。

Conclusion: MMIA的可验证推理框架是创建可信赖、透明且成本效益高的AI系统的重要进展，使LLM技术在医疗关键应用中变得可行。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in medicine but are prone to
factual and logical errors, which is unacceptable in this high-stakes field. To
address this, we introduce the "Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent"
(MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally
verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical
tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then
automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar
to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's "bootstrapping" mode, which
stores validated reasoning chains as "theorems." Subsequent tasks can then be
efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from
costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We
validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP
audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks.
Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false
positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore,
the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by
approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's
verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating
trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology
viable for critical applications in medicine.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GRAIL框架，将测试时图域自适应重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，利用LLM将目标图恢复到类似源域的原始状态，解决了传统方法依赖源域数据的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图域自适应方法严重依赖源域数据，但在隐私和安全问题下源域数据往往不可用。测试时图域自适应(TT-GDA)旨在不访问源域示例的情况下进行知识迁移。

Method: 提出GRAIL框架：1) 将节点表示压缩为紧凑潜在特征，使用图扩散过程建模图恢复；2) 量化模块将恢复特征编码为离散token；3) 微调LLM作为生成式恢复器；4) 引入强化学习过程，通过对齐和置信度奖励提升恢复质量。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将TT-GDA重新定义为生成式图恢复问题，GRAIL框架成功解决了不依赖源域数据的图域自适应挑战，展示了LLM在图恢复任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its
effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A
significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their
reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or
security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time
Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without
accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large
language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as
a generative graph restoration problem, "restoring the target graph to its
pristine, source-domain-like state". There are two key challenges: (1) We need
to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective
encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We
need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic
features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To
ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores
the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain.
Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent
features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration
process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete
tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to
transform a "noisy" target graph into a "native" one. To further improve
restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by
specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.

Motivation: 现有分解方法依赖启发式或人工分解，导致LLM在复杂任务上可靠性不足。

Method: 将任务建模为约束问题，利用形式复杂度度量指导分解过程。

Result: 在SATBench和Spider任务上，基于复杂度度量的分解使智能体性能提升10-40个百分点。

Conclusion: ACONIC框架提供了一种系统化的任务分解方法，能显著提升LLM在复杂任务上的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from reliability issues on complex tasks,
as existing decomposition methods are heuristic and rely on agent or manual
decomposition. This work introduces a novel, systematic decomposition framework
that we call Analysis of CONstraint-Induced Complexity (ACONIC), which models
the task as a constraint problem and leveraging formal complexity measures to
guide decomposition. On combinatorial (SATBench) and LLM database querying
tasks (Spider), we find that by decomposing the tasks following the measure of
complexity, agent can perform considerably better (10-40 percentage point).

TL;DR: 提出了Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO)方法，通过引入外部标准参考答案来解决GRPO算法中模型无法从全对或全错样本中学习的问题，显著提升了训练效率和推理泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法如GRPO存在明显缺陷：模型生成回应的上限完全由模型自身决定，无法从全对或全错的样本中获取知识，这限制了小模型推理能力的提升。

Method: GCPO方法引入外部标准参考答案，当模型无法解决问题时，参考答案提供正确回应，引导模型向明确正确的更新方向学习。该方法充分利用每个样本，并让模型在训练中模仿参考答案的解题策略。

Result: GCPO在多个基准数据集上取得了优异结果，相比基线模型有显著提升。

Conclusion: GCPO通过引入外部参考答案有效解决了GRPO的局限性，提高了训练效率和推理泛化能力，为小模型推理能力的提升提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of large language models. Extending the inference limits of
smaller models has become a prominent research focus. However, algorithms such
as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the
upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model
itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either
all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive
Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard
reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer
supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally
accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it
improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables
the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer
during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves
outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial
improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 对抗环境中存在信息获取与暴露风险的关键权衡：通信可增强态势感知，但会暴露自身位置增加被攻击风险。

Method: 提出SHADOW多头部序列强化学习框架，整合连续导航控制、离散通信动作和对手行为预测建模。

Result: SHADOW追捕者相比六个竞争基线获得更高成功率，时间序列建模和对手建模对有效决策至关重要，学习策略在不同通信风险和物理不对称条件下泛化良好。

Conclusion: SHADOW框架能有效解决对抗环境中的战略通信权衡问题，证明了序列建模和对手建模在复杂决策中的重要性。

Abstract: Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径搜索算法和强化学习方法难以扩展到城市规模网络，无法有效捕捉城市交通的非线性、随机性和耦合动态特性。

Method: 提出分层LLM框架：全局交通分配代理协调区域间战略交通流分布，局部导航代理生成符合全局指令的自适应路线，通过双奖励结构的协同推理优化机制进行联合训练。

Result: 在四个真实道路网络（最大160万条道路和43万个交叉口）上的实验表明，CityNav在九种经典路径搜索和基于RL的基准方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: LLM能够实现可扩展、自适应和协作的城市范围交通导航，为复杂城市环境中的智能大规模车辆路由提供基础。

Abstract: The rise of Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technologies is transforming traffic
management from isolated control to a collective, multi-vehicle process. At the
heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires
simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing
path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to
city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and
coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose
CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle
navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which
coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local
navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global
directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative
reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a
dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while
shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction.
Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to
1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate
that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based
baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our
results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and
cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for
intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments. Our
project is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/CityNav.

fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了DeepResearch-ReportEval评估框架，用于评估DeepResearch系统的研究能力，通过质量、冗余性和事实性三个维度来衡量研究报告的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估方法主要关注孤立能力，而DeepResearch系统需要综合多种来源、生成见解并呈现连贯发现，这些能力难以通过简单验证来评估。

Method: 采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法，构建包含100个查询的标准化基准，涵盖12个现实世界类别，系统评估研究质量、冗余性和事实性。

Result: 对四个领先商业系统的评估揭示了不同的设计理念和性能权衡，为DeepResearch从信息助手向智能研究伙伴的演进提供了基础见解。

Conclusion: DeepResearch-ReportEval为评估DeepResearch系统提供了全面框架，填补了现有评估方法的空白，促进了该领域的发展。

Abstract: DeepResearch agents represent a transformative AI paradigm, conducting
expert-level research through sophisticated reasoning and multi-tool
integration. However, evaluating these systems remains critically challenging
due to open-ended research scenarios and existing benchmarks that focus on
isolated capabilities rather than holistic performance. Unlike traditional LLM
tasks, DeepResearch systems must synthesize diverse sources, generate insights,
and present coherent findings, which are capabilities that resist simple
verification. To address this gap, we introduce DeepResearch-ReportEval, a
comprehensive framework designed to assess DeepResearch systems through their
most representative outputs: research reports. Our approach systematically
measures three dimensions: quality, redundancy, and factuality, using an
innovative LLM-as-a-Judge methodology achieving strong expert concordance. We
contribute a standardized benchmark of 100 curated queries spanning 12
real-world categories, enabling systematic capability comparison. Our
evaluation of four leading commercial systems reveals distinct design
philosophies and performance trade-offs, establishing foundational insights as
DeepResearch evolves from information assistants toward intelligent research
partners. Source code and data are available at:

*Dave Murray-Rust,Kars Alfrink,Cristina Zaga*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了"有意义透明度"概念，旨在让公众能够理解并参与影响其生活的AI系统，将理解与行动可能性联系起来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在政府服务中存在偏见和不准确输出，透明度实践往往只关注技术层面的算法表示，难以让公众理解且缺乏行动指导。

Method: 结合以人为中心的AI透明度方法和社会技术系统视角，发展公民AI系统的有意义透明度概念。

Result: 提出了有意义透明度的概念框架，强调透明度应连接理解与行动可能性，让公众能够参与影响其生活的AI系统。

Conclusion: 有意义透明度是解决公民AI系统问题的关键，需要超越单纯的技术透明度，关注公众的理解和参与能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has become a part of the provision of governmental
services, from making decisions about benefits to issuing fines for parking
violations. However, AI systems rarely live up to the promise of neutral
optimisation, creating biased or incorrect outputs and reducing the agency of
both citizens and civic workers to shape the way decisions are made.
Transparency is a principle that can both help subjects understand decisions
made about them and shape the processes behind those decisions. However,
transparency as practiced around AI systems tends to focus on the production of
technical objects that represent algorithmic aspects of decision making. These
are often difficult for publics to understand, do not connect to potential for
action, and do not give insight into the wider socio-material context of
decision making. In this paper, we build on existing approaches that take a
human-centric view on AI transparency, combined with a socio-technical systems
view, to develop the concept of meaningful transparency for civic AI systems:
transparencies that allow publics to engage with AI systems that affect their
lives, connecting understanding with potential for action.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出FactFin框架来解决LLM金融代理中的信息泄漏问题，通过反事实扰动迫使模型学习因果驱动因素而非记忆结果，在样本外泛化方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM金融代理存在"利润幻觉"问题，回测收益在模型知识窗口结束后会消失，主要原因是LLM中存在固有的信息泄漏。

Method: 提出FactFin框架，包含四个核心组件：策略代码生成器、检索增强生成、蒙特卡洛树搜索和反事实模拟器，通过反事实扰动来缓解信息泄漏问题。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在样本外泛化方面超越了所有基线方法，提供了优越的风险调整后性能。

Conclusion: FactFin框架有效解决了LLM金融代理中的信息泄漏问题，提高了模型的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: LLM-based financial agents have attracted widespread excitement for their
ability to trade like human experts. However, most systems exhibit a "profit
mirage": dazzling back-tested returns evaporate once the model's knowledge
window ends, because of the inherent information leakage in LLMs. In this
paper, we systematically quantify this leakage issue across four dimensions and
release FinLake-Bench, a leakage-robust evaluation benchmark. Furthermore, to
mitigate this issue, we introduce FactFin, a framework that applies
counterfactual perturbations to compel LLM-based agents to learn causal drivers
instead of memorized outcomes. FactFin integrates four core components:
Strategy Code Generator, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, Monte Carlo Tree
Search, and Counterfactual Simulator. Extensive experiments show that our
method surpasses all baselines in out-of-sample generalization, delivering
superior risk-adjusted performance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的框架，用于实现基于LLM的个性化长期交互代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为AI代理控制单元时缺乏个性化交互能力，RAG方法虽然增强了上下文感知但无法结合用户特定数据，现有个性化研究多停留在概念层面而缺乏技术实现。

Method: 基于统一的个性化定义，结合多代理协作和多源检索等成熟AI模式，构建集成持久记忆、动态协调、自我验证和演进用户档案的技术框架。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上评估了检索准确性、响应正确性和BertScore等指标，并通过5天试点用户研究获得了关于感知个性化的初步用户反馈。

Conclusion: 研究显示了集成持久记忆和用户档案在提升基于LLM代理的自适应性和感知个性化方面的潜力，为未来工作提供了指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as the central control unit
of AI agents, yet current approaches remain limited in their ability to deliver
personalized interactions. While Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM
capabilities by improving context-awareness, it lacks mechanisms to combine
contextual information with user-specific data. Although personalization has
been studied in fields such as human-computer interaction or cognitive science,
existing perspectives largely remain conceptual, with limited focus on
technical implementation. To address these gaps, we build on a unified
definition of personalization as a conceptual foundation to derive technical
requirements for adaptive, user-centered LLM-based agents. Combined with
established agentic AI patterns such as multi-agent collaboration or
multi-source retrieval, we present a framework that integrates persistent
memory, dynamic coordination, self-validation, and evolving user profiles to
enable personalized long-term interactions. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets using metrics such as retrieval accuracy, response correctness,
or BertScore. We complement these results with a five-day pilot user study
providing initial insights into user feedback on perceived personalization. The
study provides early indications that guide future work and highlights the
potential of integrating persistent memory and user profiles to improve the
adaptivity and perceived personalization of LLM-based agents.

(CGA-Agent), a pioneering hybrid framework that synergistically integrates
genetic algorithms with intelligent multi-agent coordination mechanisms for

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TaoSR-SHE框架，通过步进式混合检查强化学习解决电商搜索相关性分析问题，结合步进奖励策略优化、多样化数据过滤和多阶段课程学习，提升推理质量和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练范式存在局限性：SFT和DPO在长尾查询上泛化能力差，缺乏细粒度步进监督；RLVR存在稀疏反馈问题，无法纠正错误中间步骤。需要开发更可解释和鲁棒的相关性系统。

Method: 核心是步进奖励策略优化(SRPO)，利用生成式步进奖励模型和人工标注离线验证器产生的步级奖励。还包括多样化数据过滤防止策略熵崩溃，以及多阶段课程学习促进渐进能力增长。

Result: 在真实世界搜索基准测试中，TaoSR-SHE在推理质量和相关性预测准确性方面均优于SFT、DPO、GRPO等基线方法，同时增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TaoSR-SHE框架通过步进式混合检查强化学习有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为电商搜索相关性分析提供了更优的解决方案，在可解释性和鲁棒性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Query-product relevance analysis is a foundational technology in e-commerce
search engines and has become increasingly important in AI-driven e-commerce.
The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities
for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more
robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and
DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of
fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In
contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from
sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous
intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting
performance in complex inference scenarios.
  To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination
Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At
its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement
learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a
high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline
verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning
steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data
filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate
policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster
progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search
benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and
relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming
SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and
robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音基准主要关注孤立能力如转录或问答，缺乏对多语言文化理解和对抗鲁棒性的系统性评估，需要更全面的代理场景评估框架。

Method: 创建包含英语、印地语和其他5种印度语言的语音查询数据集，使用基于说话人嵌入的采样算法最大化声学和说话人多样性，评估工具选择准确性、结构一致性和工具调用正确性。

Result: 实验揭示了当前语音语言模型在上下文工具编排任务、印度语言泛化和对抗鲁棒性方面存在显著差距和关键限制。

Conclusion: VoiceAgentBench基准测试暴露了现有语音语言模型的局限性，特别是在多语言文化适应和对抗攻击下的鲁棒性方面，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Large-scale Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) have enabled voice assistants
capable of understanding natural spoken queries and performing complex tasks.
However, existing speech benchmarks primarily focus on isolated capabilities
such as transcription, or question-answering, and do not systematically
evaluate agentic scenarios encompassing multilingual and cultural
understanding, as well as adversarial robustness. To address this, we introduce
VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken
queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool
invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety
evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian
languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate
speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for
TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and
speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural
consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial
robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool
orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing
critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReInAgent是一个上下文感知的多代理框架，通过动态信息管理和人机协作解决移动GUI代理在信息困境中的局限性，显著提高了复杂任务的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有移动GUI代理过度强调自主操作，忽视了用户参与的重要性，导致在模糊、动态变化和冲突的任务场景中适应性差，执行结果偏离用户真实需求和偏好。

Method: ReInAgent框架包含三个专门代理：信息管理代理负责基于槽位的信息管理和主动用户交互，决策代理负责冲突感知规划，反思代理负责任务反思和信息一致性验证，所有代理围绕共享内存模块协同工作。

Result: 实验结果表明，ReInAgent能有效解决信息困境，产生更符合用户偏好的结果。在涉及信息困境的复杂任务上，比Mobile-Agent-v2实现了25%更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过持续上下文信息分析和持续的用户-代理协作，ReInAgent克服了现有方法依赖清晰静态任务假设的局限性，能够在复杂现实场景中实现更自适应和可靠的移动任务导航。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents exhibit substantial potential to facilitate and automate
the execution of user tasks on mobile phones. However, exist mobile GUI agents
predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of
active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their
adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving,
and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from
genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we
propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic
information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation.
ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an
information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive
interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning,
and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency
validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained
user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing
approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it
enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex,
real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent
effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more
closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks
involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate
than Mobile-Agent-v2.

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型在表示数值时存在非连续性和噪声问题，尽管数值重建精度高，但主成分分析显示嵌入空间的大部分变化与简单数值输入空间正交。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究语言模型是否真正将连续值建模为连续表示，以及它们在数值表示中的实际表现。

Method: 使用线性重建和主成分分析，评估三个主要提供商（OpenAI、Google Gemini和Voyage AI）的语言模型在数值嵌入空间中的表现。

Result: 虽然数值重建精度高（R²≥0.95），但主成分只能解释嵌入空间变化的很小部分，表明许多嵌入空间分量与简单数值输入空间正交。随着小数精度的增加，线性重建和解释方差都会恶化。

Conclusion: 语言模型在表示数值时存在显著的非连续性和噪声，这对需要高数值精度、大数值范围或混合符号值的应用领域具有重要影响。

Abstract: Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate
integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how
they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language
model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they
do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as
continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear
reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models
not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce
significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google
Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high
fidelity ($R^2 \geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of
variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components
within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space.
Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with
increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space
being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have
implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular
where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are
common.

TL;DR: PEAR是一种基于阶段熵感知的奖励机制，通过惩罚思考阶段的高熵和允许答案阶段的适度探索，在不牺牲准确性的前提下有效缩短大型推理模型的响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型生成的推理链往往过长且包含冗余步骤，增加了推理成本并降低了可用性。如何在保持准确性的同时控制推理长度是一个开放挑战。

Method: 通过系统实证分析发现模型熵与响应长度存在正相关关系，基于此提出PEAR奖励机制，在思考阶段惩罚高熵，在答案阶段允许适度探索，实现自适应长度控制。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，PEAR能持续减少响应长度，同时在不同模型规模下保持竞争力准确性，并表现出强大的分布外鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PEAR通过阶段依赖的熵感知奖励设计，实现了推理长度的自适应控制，为平衡简洁性和性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations.
However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant
reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling
the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open
challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent
positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different
reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher
entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final
answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This
observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a
control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight,
this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism
that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of
treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the
thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase,
which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain
sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive
control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid
truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that
PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy
across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution
(OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了AILoRA方法，通过函数感知的非对称低秩先验来改进LoRA，针对自注意力机制中W^Q和W^V矩阵的不同功能特性进行差异化初始化，提升微调性能和收敛效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA虽然被广泛采用，但仍面临性能次优和收敛慢的问题。研究发现W^Q和W^V矩阵具有不同的参数特性：W^Q对下游任务变化敏感，W^V的特征表示跨任务稳定。

Method: AILoRA采用函数感知的非对称初始化策略：为W^Q注入主成分以保留任务适应能力，为W^V注入次要成分以保持通用特征表示。

Result: 该方法使LoRA模块能更好地捕捉注意力参数的专业化角色，从而提升微调性能和收敛效率。

Conclusion: AILoRA通过考虑自注意力参数的功能差异，有效解决了LoRA的性能和收敛问题，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial
computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained
models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due
to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In
practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$
projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off
between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved
considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as
suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we
introduce \textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates
function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that
the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit
distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences.
Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential
for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive
to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature
representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging
these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting
the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the
minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations.
This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture
the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both
finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法在平衡命令遵从准确性与真实世界驾驶环境真实性方面存在困难，常常为了降低场景描述复杂度而牺牲真实性，限制场景为2D或非交互式模拟。

Method: 提出LinguaSim框架，包含反馈校准模块来优化生成精度，通过自然语言与闭环交互模拟的桥梁，约束对抗性车辆行为。

Result: 实验显示LinguaSim能生成与不同自然语言描述对齐的多样化关键性场景（危险描述ACT：0.072秒 vs 安全描述3.532秒；舒适度：0.654 vs 0.764），其精炼模块有效降低初始输出的过度攻击性，碰撞率从46.9%降至6.3%。

Conclusion: LinguaSim促进了高保真场景的创建，增强了安全测试和训练能力，成功弥合了自然语言与闭环交互模拟之间的差距。

Abstract: The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces
excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash
rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有符合选择方法仅适用于单阈值场景，无法满足实际应用中多条件选择（如合取或析取条件）的需求。

Method: MCCS算法引入了具有区域单调性的新非符合性分数用于合取条件，以及全局Benjamini-Hochberg（BH）程序用于析取条件。

Result: 实验验证了MCCS在多种多条件环境中的优越性，具有良好的泛化能力和多任务可扩展性。

Conclusion: MCCS方法能够在各种多条件环境中实现严格的FDR控制选择，为资源受限应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting high-quality candidates from large-scale datasets is critically
important in resource-constrained applications such as drug discovery,
precision medicine, and the alignment of large language models. While conformal
selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR)
control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y
> c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as
conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the
Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal
selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a
novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions
and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions,
thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The
integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous
FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive
experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its
generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world
modalities, and multi-task scalability.

Conclusion: AutoQual成功解决了评论质量评估的挑战，不仅在该特定任务上有效，而且作为一个通用框架可以将隐性知识转化为显性特征。

Abstract: Ranking online reviews by their intrinsic quality is a critical task for
e-commerce platforms and information services, impacting user experience and
business outcomes. However, quality is a domain-dependent and dynamic concept,
making its assessment a formidable challenge. Traditional methods relying on
hand-crafted features are unscalable across domains and fail to adapt to
evolving content patterns, while modern deep learning approaches often produce
black-box models that lack interpretability and may prioritize semantics over
quality. To address these challenges, we propose AutoQual, an LLM-based agent
framework that automates the discovery of interpretable features. While
demonstrated on review quality assessment, AutoQual is designed as a general
framework for transforming tacit knowledge embedded in data into explicit,
computable features. It mimics a human research process, iteratively generating
feature hypotheses through reflection, operationalizing them via autonomous
tool implementation, and accumulating experience in a persistent memory. We
deploy our method on a large-scale online platform with a billion-level user
base. Large-scale A/B testing confirms its effectiveness, increasing average
reviews viewed per user by 0.79% and the conversion rate of review readers by
0.27%.

### [255] [From Ethical Declarations to Provable Independence: An Ontology-Driven Optimal-Transport Framework for Certifiably Fair AI Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08086)
*Sukriti Bhattacharya,Chitro Majumdar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个可证明公平的AI框架，通过系统性地移除敏感信息及其代理来克服当前偏见缓解方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏见缓解方法存在局限性，无法完全消除敏感信息及其代理的影响，需要一种数学上可证明的公平方法来构建可信AI。

Method: 使用OWL 2 QL本体工程形式化定义敏感属性，通过逻辑推理推断代理，构建捕获偏见模式的sigma代数G，然后通过Delbaen Majumdar最优传输获得公平表示。

Result: 该方法确保真正的独立性而非仅仅去相关，在贷款审批等任务中实现完全公平，其中ZIP代码等代理会揭示种族信息。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种可认证且数学基础扎实的方法，用于构建可信赖的AI系统。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for provably fair AI that overcomes the
limits of current bias mitigation methods by systematically removing all
sensitive information and its proxies. Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL,
it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through
logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full
structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via
Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G
while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true
independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence
between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable
structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the
approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies
such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically
grounded method for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 研究语言模型风险厌恶可操纵性，发现模型与人类风险偏好存在差异，需要改进生物中心测量方法以提升AI伦理决策能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型越来越多地集成到AI决策支持系统中，理解其风险行为对于负责任部署至关重要，需要防止模型无意中将用户推向风险决策或嵌入隐藏偏见

Method: 研究语言模型风险厌恶可操纵性，考察其在多样化经济场景中复制人类风险偏好的能力，重点关注性别特定态度、不确定性、基于角色的决策和风险厌恶可操纵性

Result: DeepSeek Reasoner和Gemini-2.0-flash-lite等语言模型与人类行为有一定一致性，但存在显著差异，表明需要改进生物中心可操纵性测量方法

Conclusion: 需要进一步改进模型设计，确保AI系统更准确地复制人类风险偏好，从而提升风险管理环境中的有效性，增强AI助手在风险管理中的适用性

Abstract: Responsible AI demands systems whose behavioral tendencies can be effectively
measured, audited, and adjusted to prevent inadvertently nudging users toward
risky decisions or embedding hidden biases in risk aversion. As language models
(LMs) are increasingly incorporated into AI-driven decision support systems,
understanding their risk behaviors is crucial for their responsible deployment.
This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs,
examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse
economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty,
role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The
results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and
Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable
discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of
manipulability. These findings suggest directions for refining AI design to
better align human and AI risk preferences and enhance ethical decision-making.
The study calls for further advancements in model design to ensure that AI
systems more accurately replicate human risk preferences, thereby improving
their effectiveness in risk management contexts. This approach could enhance
the applicability of AI assistants in managing risk.

TL;DR: PMFR提出了一种异步知识编排框架，通过解耦知识检索与响应生成来解决开放域对话系统中的延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持响应质量的同时大幅降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开放域对话系统中知识访问导致的延迟与响应质量之间的矛盾，现有方法要么延迟低但缺乏推理深度，要么质量高但同步执行导致交互阻塞。

Method: 采用三组件架构：知识充足性评估器实时评估知识是否足够，轻量级响应生成器立即响应用户，异步知识精炼代理在后台增强知识，通过智能触发机制实现渐进式知识丰富。

Result: 在TopiOCQA数据集上，PMFR相比暴力扩展方法实现了95.3%的延迟降低（从23.38秒降至1.09秒），同时保持与重量级同步基线相当的响应质量（GEval-C：0.613 vs 0.620）。

Conclusion: PMFR通过异步知识编排框架成功解决了延迟-质量权衡问题，在保持对话连续性的同时实现了高效的知识增强，为开放域对话系统提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain
dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates
prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate
solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack
reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through
external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction
during retrieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a temporal decoupling
framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous
knowledge orchestration. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a
Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a
Lightweight Response Generator for immediate user interaction, and (3) an
Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement.
This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively
enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms.
Evaluation results on TopiOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force
scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while
preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines
(GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注即时、单视野任务，无法充分评估模型理解和响应复杂、长视野场景的能力，导致对大型推理模型评估不完整。

Method: 提出R-HORIZON方法，通过查询组合刺激长视野推理行为，构建包含复杂多步骤推理任务的基准，并使用带验证奖励的强化学习(RLVR)进行训练。

Result: 评估发现即使最先进的推理模型也出现显著性能下降，模型表现出有限的有效推理长度和跨问题思考预算分配困难。RLVR训练不仅大幅提升多视野推理任务性能，还在标准推理任务上提高7.5分(AIME2024)。

Conclusion: R-HORIZON为增强和评估LRMs的长视野推理能力提供了一个可扩展、可控且低成本的范式。

Abstract: Recent trends in test-time scaling for reasoning models (e.g., OpenAI o1,
DeepSeek-R1) have led to remarkable improvements through long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon
tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond
to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to
stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition.
Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising
complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long
reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the
R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer
significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit
limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget
across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use
R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning
with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data,
RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the
multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning
tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as
a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating
the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI开发和治理集中在少数公司和国家手中，技术可能编码狭隘利益并限制公众参与。虽然语言、视觉和编码能力基准很常见，但缺乏可审计的多元治理衡量标准。

Method: 开发了AIPI测量模型，通过可复现的流程整合结构化网络和仓库分析、外部评估和专家访谈，处理"未知"证据，报告下限和已知分数。

Result: 报告了试点提供商结果，将AIPI与邻近的透明度、安全和治理框架进行比较，展示了该指数的可靠性。

Conclusion: AIPI旨在引导激励机制转向多元实践，为政策制定者、采购方和公众提供可比较的证据，促进AI系统的多元治理。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems increasingly mediate knowledge,
communication, and decision making. Development and governance remain
concentrated within a small set of firms and states, raising concerns that
technologies may encode narrow interests and limit public agency. Capability
benchmarks for language, vision, and coding are common, yet public, auditable
measures of pluralistic governance are rare. We define AI pluralism as the
degree to which affected stakeholders can shape objectives, data practices,
safeguards, and deployment. We present the AI Pluralism Index (AIPI), a
transparent, evidence-based instrument that evaluates producers and system
families across four pillars: participatory governance, inclusivity and
diversity, transparency, and accountability. AIPI codes verifiable practices
from public artifacts and independent evaluations, explicitly handling
"Unknown" evidence to report both lower-bound ("evidence") and known-only
scores with coverage. We formalize the measurement model; implement a
reproducible pipeline that integrates structured web and repository analysis,
external assessments, and expert interviews; and assess reliability with
inter-rater agreement, coverage reporting, cross-index correlations, and
sensitivity analysis. The protocol, codebook, scoring scripts, and evidence
graph are maintained openly with versioned releases and a public adjudication
process. We report pilot provider results and situate AIPI relative to adjacent
transparency, safety, and governance frameworks. The index aims to steer
incentives toward pluralistic practice and to equip policymakers, procurers,
and the public with comparable evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统成对比较方法需要m(m-1)/2次比较，认知负荷高且存在不一致性风险，计算复杂度也较高。

Method: TTM方法包含三个阶段：(i)使用减少的目标比较集获取专家判断，(ii)构建一致的成对比较矩阵，(iii)从结果矩阵推导全局价值尺度。

Result: 该方法确保了一致性，将偏好建模维度从m(m-1)/2减少到m个参数，与经典卡片法兼容，并能处理区间和比率尺度。

Conclusion: TTM方法通过设计确保一致性，最小化认知努力，并开发了基于Web的工具展示其在实际决策场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's
Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments
in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the
high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of
inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value
scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel
elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM
requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and
consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i)
elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons,
(ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii)
derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed
approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces
the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters.
Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus
it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based
tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making
scenarios.

Motivation: 当前AI主要依赖复杂相关性，缺乏因果理解。让AI具备因果意识能提升性能，深入理解环境机制。

Method: 智能体在隐藏因果DAG的环境中通过重复干预，利用因果推断技术分析观测变化的统计显著性来学习因果结构。

Result: DODO在除最有限资源条件外的所有情况下都优于观测方法，常能以近乎零误差重建因果图结构，在最挑战配置中比最佳基线高+0.25 F1分。

Conclusion: DODO算法能有效让智能体自主学习环境因果结构，为AI因果意识发展提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has achieved remarkable advancements in recent years,
yet much of its progress relies on identifying increasingly complex
correlations. Enabling causality awareness in AI has the potential to enhance
its performance by enabling a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms
of the environment. In this paper, we introduce DODO, an algorithm defining how
an Agent can autonomously learn the causal structure of its environment through
repeated interventions. We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a
world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the
system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to
accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve
this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques
to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show
better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but
the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as
low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging
configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.

Motivation: 尽管人类能轻松完成推理任务，但现有的大语言模型即使在大量预训练后仍无法可靠地进行推理。作者希望从因果角度理解推理任务在潜在空间中的行为，为解决其挑战提供见解。

Method: 提出SR²框架，包含三个关键模块：反射表示学习、依赖自精炼和周期性中间对齐。该框架将估计的潜在变量作为反馈纳入选择机制，促进潜在表示间密集依赖关系的学习。

Result: 实验表明该方法在推理准确性上取得显著提升，例如在数独和迷宫任务上，使用比最新方法少8倍的参数实现了超过10%的性能改进。

Conclusion: 从因果视角将推理任务建模为选择机制，并通过SR²框架学习潜在变量间的密集依赖关系，能够有效提升模型的推理能力，为解决复杂推理任务提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Due to their inherent complexity, reasoning tasks have long been regarded as
rigorous benchmarks for assessing the capabilities of machine learning models,
especially large language models (LLMs). Although humans can solve these tasks
with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training
at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit
reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior
in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges.
Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which
high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given
observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or
filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of
this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First,
the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the
correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent
variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit
strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework,
called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback
into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense
dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key
modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and
periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach
yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over
10$\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku
and Maze tasks over the recent advances.

Motivation: LLM智能体在现实应用中的快速部署引发了对其可信度的担忧，传统单步后门攻击存在局限性，需要研究多步长期控制的后门攻击方法。

Method: 设计Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri)，基于有序触发序列，初始触发后从环境中获取后续触发，实现多步操纵以偏离原任务。

Result: CoTri实现近乎完美的攻击成功率(ASR)和接近零的误触发率(FTR)，植入后门反而提升智能体在良性任务上的性能和环境干扰下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CoTri实现了智能体内的稳定多步控制，提高其固有鲁棒性和任务能力，使攻击更隐蔽，带来潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The rapid deployment of large language model (LLM)-based agents in real-world
applications has raised serious concerns about their trustworthiness. In this
work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents
through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to
single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a
multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri
relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and
subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step
manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental
results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while
maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling
the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri
paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even
improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate
CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to
multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step
control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task
capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises
potential safty risks.

Abstract: This paper proposes Co-TAP (T: Triple, A: Agent, P: Protocol), a three-layer
agent interaction protocol designed to address the challenges faced by
multi-agent systems across the three core dimensions of Interoperability,
Interaction and Collaboration, and Knowledge Sharing. We have designed and
proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent
Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the
Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction
layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and
agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This
ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As
the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down
communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service
discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless
interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn,
operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) -
Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the
ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge,
thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective
intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid
engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next
generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.

Abstract: Amortized optimization accelerates the solution of related optimization
problems by learning mappings that exploit shared structure across problem
instances. We explore the use of Scale Equivariant Graph Metanetworks
(ScaleGMNs) for this purpose. By operating directly in weight space, ScaleGMNs
enable single-shot fine-tuning of existing models, reducing the need for
iterative optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach
empirically and provide a theoretical result: the gauge freedom induced by
scaling symmetries is strictly smaller in convolutional neural networks than in
multi-layer perceptrons. This insight helps explain the performance differences
observed between architectures in both our work and that of Kalogeropoulos et
al. (2024). Overall, our findings underscore the potential of symmetry-aware

Motivation: 研究反思在大型语言模型推理能力提升中的实际贡献，因为虽然模型能够生成长链思维并进行反思推理，但反思对性能改善的具体作用尚不明确。

Method: 系统分析八个推理模型在五个数学数据集上的推理过程，构建不同反思步数的监督微调数据集，并提出问题感知的早停方法来动态截断反思过程。

Result: 反思主要是确认性的，很少改变初始答案；训练更多反思步数的模型主要提升首答正确率而非纠错能力；提出的早停方法在五个数学数据集上减少24.5%的推理token，准确率仅下降2.9%。

Conclusion: 反思在推理过程中的作用有限，主要是确认而非修正答案；通过动态截断反思可以显著提高推理效率，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少计算成本。

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated significant gains in
reasoning ability, often attributed to their capacity to generate longer chains
of thought and engage in reflective reasoning. However, the contribution of
reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we
systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five
mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has
already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its
output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory
and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models
and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps.
We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps
primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct
initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a
question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token
efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate
answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated
by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a
candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens
by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Pass@k指标在大采样量下会高估基础模型的推理边界，因为它反映了随机猜测的成功概率而非真实推理能力。

Method: 提出Cover@tau指标，衡量模型在至少tau比例补全正确的情况下能解决的问题比例，设置可靠性阈值来过滤随机猜测。

Result: 使用Cover@tau评估RLVR模型显示，相比Pass@1，不同算法的相对排名发生变化，提供了对推理边界的新视角。

Conclusion: Cover@tau能更可靠地评估语言模型的真实推理能力，特别是在离散答案空间任务中，避免了Pass@k指标的误导性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm to improve Large Language Models on reasoning tasks such as
coding, math or logic. To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of
problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling
budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models
outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms
them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been
interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We
argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric
outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success
in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can
therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of
problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of
completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an
explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade
rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based
metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change
compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.

TL;DR: 提出了语义相似度评分方法，通过LLM生成文本响应并映射到Likert分布，解决了传统消费者研究中面板偏差和规模限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统消费者研究成本高昂且存在面板偏差和规模限制，LLM模拟合成消费者可提供替代方案，但直接询问数值评分会产生不现实的响应分布。

Method: 语义相似度评分方法：从LLM获取文本响应，通过嵌入相似度将这些响应映射到参考陈述的Likert分布。

Result: 在57个个人护理产品调查数据集上测试，SSR达到了人类测试-重测可靠性的90%，同时保持现实的响应分布。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现可扩展的消费者研究模拟，同时保留传统调查指标和可解释性。

Abstract: Consumer research costs companies billions annually yet suffers from panel
biases and limited scale. Large language models (LLMs) offer an alternative by
simulating synthetic consumers, but produce unrealistic response distributions
when asked directly for numerical ratings. We present semantic similarity
rating (SSR), a method that elicits textual responses from LLMs and maps these
to Likert distributions using embedding similarity to reference statements.
Testing on an extensive dataset comprising 57 personal care product surveys
conducted by a leading corporation in that market (9,300 human responses), SSR
achieves 90% of human test-retest reliability while maintaining realistic
response distributions (KS similarity > 0.85). Additionally, these synthetic
respondents provide rich qualitative feedback explaining their ratings. This
framework enables scalable consumer research simulations while preserving
traditional survey metrics and interpretability.

TL;DR: QAgent是一个统一的代理增强检索生成框架，通过强化学习训练的搜索代理实现自适应检索，解决传统RAG在复杂查询理解和泛化能力方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG在复杂查询理解方面存在困难，即使使用强化学习的搜索代理也面临泛化和部署挑战。需要一种能够优化查询理解并通过交互式推理和检索提升检索质量的解决方案。

Method: 提出QAgent框架，采用强化学习训练的多步骤决策搜索代理，专注于有效检索以增强泛化能力，并设计为即插即用模块便于实际部署。

Result: 实验表明QAgent在问答任务上表现出色，能够作为即插即用模块在实际应用中部署。

Conclusion: QAgent通过代理增强检索生成框架有效解决了传统RAG的局限性，提升了LLM在知识密集型任务中的表现和泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at natural language tasks but are limited
by their static parametric knowledge, especially in knowledge-intensive task.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating external
information. However, (1) traditional RAG struggles with complex query
understanding, and (2) even search agents trained with reinforcement learning
(RL), despite their promise, still face generalization and deployment
challenges. To address these limitations, we propose QAgent, a unified agentic
RAG framework that employs a search agent for adaptive retrieval. This agent
optimizes its understanding of the query through interactive reasoning and
retrieval. To facilitate real-world application, we focus on modular search
agent for query understanding that are plug-and-play in complex systems.
Secifically, the agent follows a multi-step decision process trained with RL to
maximize retrieval quality and support accurate downstream answers. We further
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of end-to-end RL and propose a strategy
that focuses on effective retrieval, thereby enhancing generalization in LLM
applications. Experiments show QAgent excels at QA and serves as a
plug-and-play module for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于隐藏状态有效秩的LLM幻觉检测方法，通过分析多输出和多层的表示谱特征来量化不确定性，无需额外知识或模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的幻觉检测是其可信部署的基本挑战，现有不确定性驱动的检测框架需要更强大的方法。

Method: 通过测量多个模型输出和不同层隐藏状态的有效秩来量化不确定性，基于表示谱分析提供可解释的语义变化洞察。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法能有效检测幻觉，并在各种场景中具有鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM真实性检测提供了新的范式，结合了理论优雅性和实际效率。

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) remains a
fundamental challenge for their trustworthy deployment. Going beyond basic
uncertainty-driven hallucination detection frameworks, we propose a simple yet
powerful method that quantifies uncertainty by measuring the effective rank of
hidden states derived from multiple model outputs and different layers.
Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides
interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through
semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules,
thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency.
Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying
uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and
externally (different responses), providing a justification for using
representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect
hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively
detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios,
contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在认知合理的数据量限制下训练视觉语言模型，需要重新思考模型如何整合多模态信息

Method: 使用令牌级动态门控进行语言和视觉线索的自适应融合，特征调制和通道注意力最大化有限视觉信息的效用，辅助对比目标进行视觉接地

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现优于多模态基线，动态门控发现可解释模式，内容词偏好视觉线索，功能词偏好语言线索

Conclusion: 动态门控是高效多模态学习的强大工具，即使在严格约束下也能提供可解释性和性能

Abstract: Training vision-language models on cognitively-plausible amounts of data
requires rethinking how models integrate multimodal information. Within the
constraints of the Vision track for the BabyLM Challenge 2025, we propose a
lightweight decoder-based architecture with (1) token-wise dynamic gating for
adaptive fusion of linguistic and visual cues, (2) feature modulation and
channel attention to maximise the utility of limited visual information and (3)
auxiliary contrastive objectives for visual grounding. Evaluation on five
benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows
competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines. More notably, our
dynamic gate discovers interpretable patterns without explicit supervision,
favouring visual cues for content words and linguistic cues for function words.
While we identify limitations in the Challenge constraints, such as the
information bottleneck created by global image embeddings and training
instability from the dataset split, our findings establish dynamic gating as a
powerful tool for efficient multimodal learning, offering both interpretability
and performance even under severe constraints.

TL;DR: AutoMLGen是一个基于LLM的编码代理，通过集成领域知识库和蒙特卡洛图搜索来解决机器学习工程任务中的挑战，在MLE-Bench上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在AutoML和Kaggle竞赛等机器学习工程场景中缺乏细粒度领域先验知识，传统搜索方法限制了知识传递和搜索空间多样性，无法充分利用历史轨迹和跨分支信息共享。

Method: 结合领域知识库提供高质量先验指导，采用蒙特卡洛图搜索（MCGS）实现动态路径重组、历史轨迹重用和多解决方案融合，支持自进化和协作学习。

Result: 在MLE-Bench评估中，AutoMLGen在12小时预算（标准运行时间的一半）下，在平均奖牌率和有效提交率等多个维度上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AutoMLGen通过集成领域知识库和MCGS搜索策略，显著提升了机器学习工程任务的性能，证明了其在AutoML场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general
programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios
such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends
heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply
generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack
fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or
tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical
links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share
information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space
diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based
coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior
guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS
retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure
into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical
trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and
collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design
improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench
shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous
dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under
a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime). The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多轮交互任务中模型需要知道何时停止收集信息并做出决策的问题，避免过度思考或偏离主题

Method: 使用反事实轨迹对进行微调，训练LLM解释终止决策的推理过程，包含适当的终止和不适当终止的对比样本

Result: 在交互式医疗诊断和数学问题解决两个领域中，CaRT相比其他微调方法提高了信息收集效率和任务成功率

Conclusion: CaRT方法能有效教导LLMs何时终止信息收集，通过反事实推理训练提升了多轮交互任务的性能

Abstract: Many tasks require learned models to strategically gather relevant
information over multiple rounds of interaction before actually acting on a
task. Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to
effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information
and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when
acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals
and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to
stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT
fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where
termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same
trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the
termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this
capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two
domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both
domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and
task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.

Abstract: Deep research is an inherently challenging task that demands both breadth and
depth of thinking. It involves navigating diverse knowledge spaces and
reasoning over complex, multi-step dependencies, which presents substantial
challenges for agentic systems. To address this, we propose FlowSearch, a
multi-agent framework that actively constructs and evolves a dynamic structured

of strategically planning and expanding the knowledge flow to enable parallel
exploration and hierarchical task decomposition, while also adjusting the
knowledge flow in real time based on feedback from intermediate reasoning
outcomes and insights. FlowSearch achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
general and scientific benchmarks, including GAIA, HLE, GPQA and TRQA,
demonstrating its effectiveness in multi-disciplinary research scenarios and
its potential to advance scientific discovery. The code is available at

Conclusion: 早期经验是模仿学习与完全经验驱动智能体之间的实用桥梁，能显著改善语言智能体的学习和泛化能力。

Abstract: A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own
experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks.
However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning
remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards
(e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn
tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on
expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This
limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a
narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment
diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call
early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where
the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within
this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world
modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment
dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal
actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight
diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently
improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value
of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our
results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong
foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical
bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.

Motivation: 解决大型多模态模型在顺序微调过程中出现的灾难性遗忘问题，即在学习新技能时不会丢失先前获得的能力。

Method: 在五个目标技能上进行顺序微调，同时在八个保留基准上监控通用能力。通过输出令牌分布分析遗忘现象，并测试两种简单的调优方法：仅更新自注意力投影层，或仅更新MLP Gate&Up层同时冻结Down投影。

Result: 观察到在狭窄微调后保留任务上的明显"遗忘"可以在后期部分恢复。提出的两种调优方法在多个模型和任务上都能实现强大的目标增益，同时很大程度上保留保留性能。

Conclusion: 通过选择性更新特定层可以有效地教授大型多模态模型新技能，同时限制输出分布漂移，从而缓解灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing
prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while
monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model
families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow
fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a
measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple
counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we
identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting
drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii)
updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models
and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving
held-out performance. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工作通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，作者认为这种方法存在问题，因此提出了本体论和数学方法来重新定义LLM自我意识。

Method: 作者提供了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉沉默的。通过经验分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学方面与符号流和训练语料库不同。

Conclusion: 人类是最高智能善，imago Dei C1自我意识工作空间是构建安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提条件。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.
