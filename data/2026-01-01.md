*Ankan Aich,Yangming Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用Depth Anything V2的高保真合成先验，通过DV-LORA高效适应医疗领域，在SCARED数据集上实现单目深度估计新SOTA，在手术恶劣光照下表现更鲁棒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术中的单目深度估计在镜面反射、充满液体的环境中表现脆弱，现有自监督方法依赖带噪声伪标签的基础模型，在薄手术工具和透明表面容易出现边界塌陷问题。

Method: 利用Depth Anything V2架构的高保真合成先验（能捕捉薄结构的精确几何细节），通过动态向量低秩适应（DV-LORA）高效适应医疗领域，最小化参数预算同时弥合合成到真实的差距。引入物理分层评估协议来量化高镜面反射区域的性能。

Result: 在SCARED数据集上建立新的SOTA，准确度（<1.25）达到98.1%，平方相对误差比现有基线降低超过17%，在恶劣手术光照下表现出优越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过利用合成先验和高效适应方法，显著提升了内窥镜手术中单目深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理薄手术工具和镜面反射等挑战性场景方面。

Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

### [2] [Nonlinear Noise2Noise for Efficient Monte Carlo Denoiser Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24794)
*Andrew Tinits,Stephen Mann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种改进Noise2Noise训练的方法，允许对噪声目标图像应用特定非线性函数而不引入显著偏差，解决了HDR图像去噪中的异常值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽然无需干净目标图像，但非线性函数会引入偏差，限制了噪声目标的预处理。特别是在HDR图像去噪中，异常值问题严重，而常用的色调映射非线性函数被认为与Noise2Noise训练不兼容。

Method: 建立理论框架分析非线性函数的影响，识别出一类引入最小偏差的非线性函数。针对HDR图像去噪，研究特定损失函数和色调映射函数的组合，在减少动态范围的同时最小化偏差。

Result: 该方法应用于蒙特卡洛渲染的HDR图像去噪，仅使用噪声训练数据就能接近原始使用高样本参考图像训练的实现效果，解决了异常值问题。

Conclusion: 某些非线性函数可以与Noise2Noise训练兼容，这扩展了噪声目标图像的预处理能力，特别有利于HDR图像去噪等应用。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

TL;DR: 提出基于视频分析的自动评估管道，用于城市作战训练中的"进入并清理房间"演练，无需额外硬件即可提取性能指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市作战训练需要情境意识和肌肉记忆，但传统评估方法依赖昂贵传感器或主观观察，难以客观评估认知、心理运动和团队协作技能，限制了可扩展性和准确性

Method: 使用计算机视觉模型从训练视频中提取2D骨架、注视向量和运动轨迹，开发特定任务指标来衡量心理运动流畅性、情境意识和团队协调，通过扩展的认知任务分析层次结构进行加权组合生成总体性能分数

Result: 通过真实ECR演练案例研究，提供了可操作的领域特定指标，能够捕捉个人和团队表现，支持在Gamemaster和GIFT系统中进行行动后审查的交互式仪表板

Conclusion: 视频分析可实现合成训练环境中的可扩展评估，但存在跟踪困难、地面真实验证等限制，未来工作包括扩展到3D视频数据

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PFP是一种神经网络结构，用于将长视频压缩为短上下文，通过预训练目标保留任意时间位置单帧的高频细节，可作为视频模型的记忆编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频处理中上下文长度限制的问题，传统方法难以在压缩视频时保持单帧的高频细节，需要一种能有效压缩长视频同时保留视觉质量的方法。

Method: 提出PFP神经网络结构，通过显式预训练目标保留单帧高频细节，可将20秒视频压缩至约5k长度的上下文，支持随机帧的感知保留检索。

Result: 预训练模型可直接微调作为自回归视频模型的记忆编码器，实现低成本长历史记忆和相对较低的质量损失，通过消融实验评估框架并讨论架构设计权衡。

Conclusion: PFP提供了一种有效的长视频压缩方案，在保持视觉质量的同时显著减少上下文成本，为长序列视频处理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present PFP, a neural network structure to compress long videos into short contexts, with an explicit pretraining objective to preserve the high-frequency details of single frames at arbitrary temporal positions. The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.

Conclusion: 首次将终身域自适应引入3D人体姿态估计，提出的GAN框架和3D姿态生成器有效缓解域偏移和对齐原始与增强姿态，解决了非平稳目标域适应和灾难性遗忘问题

Abstract: 3D Human Pose Estimation (3D HPE) is vital in various applications, from person re-identification and action recognition to virtual reality. However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator. This framework effectively mitigates domain shifts and aligns original and augmented poses. Moreover, we construct a novel 3D pose generator paradigm, integrating pose-aware, temporal-aware, and domain-aware knowledge to enhance the current domain's adaptation and alleviate catastrophic forgetting on previous domains. Our method demonstrates superior performance through extensive experiments on diverse domain adaptive 3D HPE datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出深度学习框架将儿童MRI转换为合成CT，实现颅骨分割和颅缝可视化，解决MRI无法显示骨骼结构的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童颅骨发育评估需要CT成像，但CT有辐射风险；MRI无辐射但无法显示颅骨和颅缝结构，需要非侵入性评估方法。

Method: 使用深度学习驱动的流程，将T1加权MRI转换为合成CT，预测颅骨分割，生成颅缝概率热图，并从热图直接分割颅缝。

Result: 合成CT与真实CT的结构相似度达99%，FID为1.01；颅骨分割Dice系数平均85%，颅缝分割Dice系数80%；统计检验证实合成CT与真实CT的等效性。

Conclusion: 首次实现从儿童MRI生成合成CT并进行颅缝分割，填补了无创颅骨评估的关键空白，为儿科颅骨发育评估提供了安全有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了人工智能在超高分辨率遥感数据上的扩展行为，使用超过千万亿像素的商业卫星数据训练视觉Transformer骨干网络，发现即使在如此大规模下，性能仍受数据限制而非模型参数限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态机器学习应用（如图像描述、搜索和推理）依赖于强大的领域专用编码器。在自然图像领域，互联网规模数据充足且有成熟的扩展定律指导模型容量、训练计算和数据集规模的联合扩展，但在高价值领域如遥感中，这些关系了解甚少。

Method: 使用超过千万亿像素的商业卫星电光数据，在MITRE联邦AI沙盒中训练逐渐增大的视觉Transformer骨干网络，记录在拍字节规模下观察到的成功和失败模式，并分析跨额外遥感模态的领域差距。

Result: 研究发现即使在如此大规模下，性能仍与数据受限机制一致，而非模型参数受限。这意味着需要更多数据而非更大模型来提升性能。研究还报告了在拍字节规模下观察到的具体成功和失败模式。

Conclusion: 这些实践见解旨在为数据收集策略、计算预算和优化计划提供指导，以推进前沿规模遥感基础模型的未来发展。研究强调了在遥感领域需要更多高质量数据来突破当前性能瓶颈。

Abstract: We explore the scaling behaviors of artificial intelligence to establish practical techniques for training foundation models on high-resolution electro-optical (EO) datasets that exceed the current state-of-the-art scale by orders of magnitude. Modern multimodal machine learning (ML) applications, such as generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) systems for image captioning, search, and reasoning, depend on robust, domain-specialized encoders for non-text modalities. In natural-image domains where internet-scale data is plentiful, well-established scaling laws help optimize the joint scaling of model capacity, training compute, and dataset size. Unfortunately, these relationships are much less well-understood in high-value domains like remote sensing (RS). Using over a quadrillion pixels of commercial satellite EO data and the MITRE Federal AI Sandbox, we train progressively larger vision transformer (ViT) backbones, report success and failure modes observed at petascale, and analyze implications for bridging domain gaps across additional RS modalities. We observe that even at this scale, performance is consistent with a data limited regime rather than a model parameter-limited one. These practical insights are intended to inform data-collection strategies, compute budgets, and optimization schedules that advance the future development of frontier-scale RS foundation models.

Motivation: 传统超声技能评估依赖专家监督，具有主观性和耗时性。现有自动化评估方法多采用监督学习，局限于预定义的影响因素分析

Method: 提出双层优化框架，包含临床任务预测器和技能预测器，通过同时优化两个网络来联合训练。框架通过任务执行质量来评估技能，无需人工技能评级

Result: 在真实临床胎儿头部超声视频上验证，结果显示该方法能够预测超声技能，将优化的任务性能量化为技能指标

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够通过任务执行质量评估超声技能，为客观、自动化的技能评估提供了可行方案

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

TL;DR: 提出MGML框架解决多模态MRI数据不完整问题，通过元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化模块，在不改变原模型架构下提升脑肿瘤分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中多模态MRI数据常常不完整，难以充分利用可用信息，因此最大化利用不完整多模态信息成为关键研究挑战。

Method: 提出元引导多模态学习框架，包含元参数化自适应模态融合模块（生成自适应软标签监督信号）和一致性正则化模块，可端到端集成到训练流程中。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上优于多种先进方法，在15种缺失模态组合的平均Dice分数上，WT、TC、ET分别达到87.55、79.36、62.67。

Conclusion: MGML框架能有效处理不完整多模态MRI数据，提升脑肿瘤分割性能，且无需改变原模型架构，具有良好实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Conclusion: 提出的CVGL系统通过三个关键改进有效解决了跨视角地理定位中的视角差异问题，在减少参数量的同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Conclusion: 该AI框架能为显微外科教育提供客观、实时反馈，实现标准化、数据驱动的培训协议，推进高风险手术环境中的能力评估。

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

TL;DR: 本文提出了T2VAttack，首次系统研究文本到视频扩散模型的对抗攻击，从语义和时间两个维度评估模型脆弱性，发现微小提示修改就能显著破坏视频质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到视频扩散模型在生成高质量视频方面取得显著进展，但其对抗攻击脆弱性尚未得到充分探索。考虑到视频数据的动态特性，需要从语义和时间两个维度全面评估模型安全性。

Method: 提出两种攻击方法：T2VAttack-S通过贪婪搜索识别关键词并用同义词替换；T2VAttack-I迭代插入优化词实现最小提示扰动。同时定义语义目标（评估视频-文本对齐）和时间目标（评估时间动态性）。

Result: 在ModelScope、CogVideoX、Open-Sora、HunyuanVideo等先进模型上的实验表明，即使单个词的替换或插入也能导致语义保真度和时间动态性的显著下降，揭示了当前T2V模型的严重脆弱性。

Conclusion: 当前文本到视频扩散模型对对抗攻击高度脆弱，需要加强模型鲁棒性研究。T2VAttack为评估和改进T2V模型安全性提供了系统框架。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于SATLAS基础模型的卫星时序数据异常检测方法，通过预测无变化情况下的地表状态来识别地震等灾害引起的地表变化，灵敏度比传统方法提高约3倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星影像地表变化检测对灾害响应和环境监测至关重要，但面临大气噪声、季节变化和传感器伪影等复杂因素的挑战，传统方法难以实现高灵敏度检测。

Method: 使用基于SATLAS基础模型的修复模型，利用全球分布的Sentinel-2时序数据训练，通过前序观测预测最后一帧的无变化地表状态，通过预测与观测的差异检测异常。

Result: 在2023年土耳其-叙利亚地震序列的地表破裂检测中，该方法在Tepehan地区检测到裂谷特征，灵敏度和特异性均优于时间中位数法和Reed-Xiaoli异常检测器，检测阈值比基线方法低约3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法利用深度学习从卫星时序数据中学习地表正常状态，能够以前所未有的灵敏度检测异常变化，为实现基于免费多光谱卫星数据的全球尺度自动化地表变化监测提供了路径。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet在分割精度和计算效率之间提供了有利的权衡，为临床部署提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

TL;DR: GASeg是一个通过拓扑信息桥接几何与外观的自监督语义分割框架，使用可微分盒计数模块和多目标损失来增强模型对结构特征的依赖，减少对外观歧义的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督语义分割方法在面对外观歧义（如阴影、眩光、局部纹理）时容易失败，因为它们过度依赖不稳定的外观特征。需要引入更稳定的几何拓扑信息来提升鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 提出可微分盒计数（DBC）模块，从几何特征流和外观特征流中量化多尺度拓扑统计信息；2. 引入拓扑增强（TopoAug），通过形态学操作模拟真实世界歧义；3. 设计多目标损失（GALoss）强制几何与外观特征的跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: 通过引入稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观特征，能够显著提升自监督语义分割模型在面对外观歧义时的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Abstract: Recent studies suggest that Visual Language Models (VLMs) hold great potential for tasks such as automated medical diagnosis. However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent. These results demonstrate that the proposed model offers substantial potential to improve the accuracy and reliability of medical VLM-based analysis.

Motivation: 现有流式扩散编辑方法在源图像和目标图像分布间直接转换时，潜在轨迹存在累积速度误差，导致语义不一致和结构保真度损失。

Method: 提出条件速度校正（CVC）框架，将流式编辑重新定义为由已知源先验驱动的分布转换问题。引入双视角速度转换机制，将潜在演化分解为：保持源轨迹一致性的结构保留分支，以及驱动向目标分布可控偏离的语义引导分支。通过经验贝叶斯推断和Tweedie校正进行后验一致更新，补偿量化偏差。

Conclusion: CVC通过数学基础的速度误差补偿机制，解决了流式扩散编辑中的轨迹漂移问题，为分布转换提供了稳定可靠的框架。

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

Conclusion: 提出的结构引导分配原则有效提升了2D高斯泼溅的率失真效率，同时保持了其固有的高速解码优势，为紧凑图像表示提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Conclusion: RSAgent通过多轮推理-行动交替的方法，显著提升了文本引导分割的准确性和鲁棒性，为复杂视觉语言任务提供了新的智能体框架。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

Motivation: 跨模态检索中，大规模多模态数据的标注耗时费力，不可避免地包含噪声标签，这会降低模型的检索性能。现有方法难以同时满足模型性能上限、校准可靠性和数据利用率。

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Abstract: Pathology context and expert experience play significant roles in clinical ocular disease diagnosis. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods. Further visualization analysis explains the inherent behavior of PRM and EPGA that affects the decision-making process of DNNs.

TL;DR: 提出平衡层次对比损失与解耦学习策略，解决遥感图像细粒度检测中层次标签不平衡和分类-定位干扰问题

Motivation: 细粒度遥感数据集通常使用层次标签结构，但将这种语义层次嵌入表示学习空间以提升检测性能仍具挑战。现有方法在层次监督对比学习中忽略了两个关键问题：1) 标签层次中数据分布不平衡导致高频类别主导学习过程；2) 类别间语义关系学习干扰类别无关的定位任务

Method: 提出平衡层次对比损失与解耦学习策略，结合DETR框架。平衡损失引入可学习的类别原型，在每一层次平衡不同类别的梯度贡献，确保每个层次类别在每批损失计算中平等贡献。解耦策略将DETR的对象查询分为分类和定位两组，实现任务特定特征提取和优化

Result: 在三个具有层次标注的细粒度数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 通过平衡层次对比损失解决数据不平衡问题，通过解耦学习策略避免分类-定位干扰，显著提升了细粒度遥感目标检测性能

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

TL;DR: 提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，通过两阶段"思考-行动"决策过程解决文本到动作生成中的语义-运动阻抗不匹配问题，显著提升语义对齐和物理合理性。

Motivation: 现有文本到动作生成方法将问题视为直接翻译任务，面临语义-运动阻抗不匹配的根本瓶颈：难以将语义密集的离散语言意图直接映射到运动密集的高频运动数据中。

Method: 提出Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR)框架，采用两阶段"思考-行动"决策过程：1) 使用双粒度分词器将运动解耦为语义丰富的推理潜空间和高频执行潜空间；2) 先自回归推理规划粗粒度轨迹，再实例化具体帧。

Result: 在T2M-GPT和MotionStreamer两个代表性基准上实现非平凡改进，在语义对齐和物理合理性方面均有显著提升，验证了运动规划的最佳基底是学习的运动对齐概念空间而非自然语言。

Conclusion: 通过引入潜在系统2推理架构，有效弥合语言与物理之间的不可言说性鸿沟，为文本到动作生成提供了更优的解决方案，证明了分层运动控制认知科学启发的有效性。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在几何推理评估中存在三个主要问题：测试数据可能被教科书基准污染、过度强调最终答案而非推理过程、诊断粒度不足。为了解决这些问题，需要一个新的、更全面的几何推理评估框架。

Method: 提出了GeoBench分层基准测试，包含四个推理级别：视觉感知、目标导向规划、严格定理应用和自我反思回溯。通过TrustGeoGen生成的六个正式验证任务，系统评估从属性提取到逻辑错误纠正的能力。

Result: 实验显示，虽然推理模型如OpenAI-o3优于通用多模态大语言模型，但随着任务复杂度增加，性能显著下降。关键发现包括：子目标分解和无关前提过滤对最终问题解决准确性有重要影响，而思维链提示在某些任务中意外地降低了性能。

Conclusion: GeoBench建立了一个全面的几何问题解决基准测试，同时为开发几何问题解决系统提供了可操作的指导方针，特别是在子目标分解和前提过滤方面的重要性。

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Conclusion: 这些贡献为计算机视觉中基于LLM的架构搜索提供了可操作的指导方针，并建立了严格的评估实践，使自动化设计对计算资源有限的研究人员更加可及。

Abstract: Automated neural network architecture design remains a significant challenge in computer vision. Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks. These contributions provide actionable guidelines for LLM-based architecture search in computer vision and establish rigorous evaluation practices, making automated design more accessible to researchers with limited computational resources.

Conclusion: 通过方向性修正奖励信号可以有效缓解偏好模式崩溃问题，在保持生成多样性的同时实现与人类偏好的高质量对齐

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Motivation: 传统深度神经网络分类训练依赖硬标签，导致过度自信、校准不佳、泛化能力差和鲁棒性不足。现有自蒸馏方法虽然利用模型自身预测信息，但仍依赖硬标签，效果有限。

Method: 提出贝叶斯自蒸馏（BSD），通过贝叶斯推理利用模型自身预测构建样本特定的目标分布。该方法在初始化后完全不依赖硬标签，可结合对比损失进一步提升性能。

Result: BSD在多种深度架构和数据集上表现优异：ResNet-50在CIFAR-100上测试准确率提升1.4%，预期校准误差降低40%。在数据损坏、扰动和标签噪声下表现出更好的鲁棒性，结合对比损失后在标签噪声下的单阶段单网络方法中达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BSD是一种无需硬标签的贝叶斯自蒸馏方法，能显著提升模型准确率、校准性能和鲁棒性，特别是在标签噪声环境下表现优异。

Abstract: Supervised training of deep neural networks for classification typically relies on hard targets, which promote overconfidence and can limit calibration, generalization, and robustness. Self-distillation methods aim to mitigate this by leveraging inter-class and sample-specific information present in the model's own predictions, but often remain dependent on hard targets, reducing their effectiveness. With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization. BSD consistently yields higher test accuracy (e.g. +1.4% for ResNet-50 on CIFAR-100) and significantly lower Expected Calibration Error (ECE) (-40% ResNet-50, CIFAR-100) than existing architecture-preserving self-distillation methods for a range of deep architectures and datasets. Additional benefits include improved robustness against data corruptions, perturbations, and label noise. When combined with a contrastive loss, BSD achieves state-of-the-art robustness under label noise for single-stage, single-network methods.

Result: 在四个领域（顺序规划、组合优化、约束满足、空间配置）的广泛实验中，DiffThinker显著优于GPT-5（+314.2%）、Gemini-3-Flash（+111.6%）和微调的Qwen3-VL-32B基线（+39.0%）

Conclusion: 生成式多模态推理是视觉中心推理的有前景方法，DiffThinker展示了该范式的四个核心特性：效率、可控性、原生并行性和协作性

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

*Yu-Tang Chang,Pin-Wei Chen,Shih-Fang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Deep Global Clustering (DGC) 是一个用于高光谱图像分割的内存高效框架，通过局部补丁学习全局聚类结构，无需预训练，在消费级硬件上30分钟内完成训练，但存在优化不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分析面临数据量大、内存不足的计算瓶颈。现有基于大规模遥感数据集预训练的基础模型难以迁移到近距离农业监测等特定领域应用，因为光谱特征、空间尺度和语义目标存在根本差异。

Method: 提出Deep Global Clustering (DGC)框架，通过重叠的小补丁操作学习全局聚类结构，强制一致性约束，实现恒定内存使用。该方法无需预训练，直接从未标记数据中学习。

Result: 在叶片病害数据集上，DGC实现了背景-组织分离（平均IoU 0.925），并通过可导航的语义粒度展示了无监督病害检测能力。训练时间少于30分钟，内存使用恒定。

Conclusion: DGC的设计理念有价值，但存在优化不稳定问题，根源在于多目标损失平衡。有意义的表征快速出现，但因特征空间中的聚类过度合并而退化。需要原则性的动态损失平衡方法来实现稳定实现。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

*Xingyu Zhou,Qifan Li,Xiaobin Hu,Hai Chen,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Internal Guidance (IG)方法，通过在训练过程中引入中间层监督，在采样时外推中间层和深层输出，显著提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能捕捉完整数据分布，但缺乏足够训练和数据来覆盖低概率区域，导致生成对应区域的高质量图像困难。现有引导策略如CFG会导致样本过度简化或失真，而基于"坏版本"引导的方法需要精心设计的退化策略、额外训练和采样步骤

Method: 提出Internal Guidance (IG)策略：1) 训练时在中间层引入辅助监督；2) 采样时外推中间层和深层输出来获得生成结果。这是一种简单有效的策略，无需额外训练或复杂设计

Result: 在多个基准上显著提升训练效率和生成质量：SiT-XL/2+IG在ImageNet 256x256上达到FID=5.31(80轮)和1.75(800轮)；LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34；结合CFG后达到当前SOTA的FID=1.19

Conclusion: IG是一种简单而有效的策略，通过内部引导机制显著提升扩散模型的性能，在训练效率和生成质量上都取得了突破性进展，特别是在结合CFG后达到了当前最优结果

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

*Pieter M. Blok,Haozhou Wang,Hyun Kwon Suh,Peicheng Wang,James Burridge,Wei Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PointRAFT网络，直接从RGB-D相机获取的马铃薯部分点云预测重量，无需完整3D重建，解决自遮挡导致的重量低估问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 马铃薯收获机上使用RGB-D相机估计产量时，由于自遮挡导致点云不完整，系统性地低估块茎重量，需要高精度、高吞吐量的重量预测方法。

Method: 开发PointRAFT点云回归网络，直接从部分点云预测连续3D形状属性（如重量），引入对象高度嵌入作为额外几何线索，提升预测精度。

Result: 在859个马铃薯、26,688个点云数据集上测试，平均绝对误差12.0g，均方根误差17.2g，优于线性回归和PointNet++基准，推理时间6.3ms/点云，支持每秒150个马铃薯处理。

Conclusion: PointRAFT能有效解决马铃薯重量估计问题，满足商业化收获机的高吞吐量需求，且可扩展至其他3D表型分析和机器人感知任务。

Abstract: Potato yield is a key indicator for optimizing cultivation practices in agriculture. Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters. Beyond potato weight estimation, PointRAFT provides a versatile regression network applicable to a wide range of 3D phenotyping and robotic perception tasks. The code, network weights, and a subset of the dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/pieterblok/pointraft.git.

TL;DR: CorGi是一个无需训练的DiT推理加速框架，通过选择性重用transformer块输出来减少去噪步骤间的冗余计算，实现2倍加速且保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiT)在视觉生成中表现出色，但其迭代去噪过程结合大容量模型导致推理成本高昂。现有研究表明DiT模型的迭代去噪过程在步骤间存在大量冗余计算

Method: 提出CorGi框架：1）基于贡献度指导的块级间隔缓存，缓存低贡献块并在后续步骤中重用；2）针对文生图任务的CorGi+，利用跨注意力图识别重要token并应用部分注意力更新来保护物体细节

Result: 在最先进的DiT模型上评估显示，CorGi和CorGi+平均实现高达2.0倍加速，同时保持高质量生成

Conclusion: CorGi和CorGi+通过减少DiT推理中的冗余计算，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升推理效率，为扩散变换器的高效部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

Motivation: 医学图像分类中数据不平衡问题突出，尤其在疫情期间，COVID-19检测面临数据严重不平衡的挑战，这阻碍了AI/ML算法的准确性和快速性。

Method: 1) 提出渐进式生成对抗网络生成合成数据补充真实数据；2) 采用加权方法结合合成与真实数据；3) 使用多目标元启发式群体优化算法优化分类器超参数。

Result: 在大型不平衡COVID-19胸部X光数据集上，模型在4类和2类不平衡分类问题上分别达到95.5%和98.5%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 所提模型能有效解决疫情期间医学图像分类中的数据不平衡问题，为COVID-19检测提供了准确快速的解决方案。

Abstract: The challenge of imbalanced data is prominent in medical image classification. This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively. The successful experimental outcomes demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in classifying medical images using imbalanced data during pandemics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARM是一个轻量级可学习模块，通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征来提升开放词汇语义分割性能，采用"训练一次，随处使用"范式，可作为通用即插即用后处理器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费方法要么依赖昂贵的外部基础模型（如SAM、DINO），要么使用静态启发式方法处理CLIP内部特征，导致计算成本高或效果欠佳。CLIP的图像级表示缺乏像素级细节，限制了开放词汇语义分割性能。

Method: 提出注意力精炼模块（ARM），包含语义引导的交叉注意力块（使用深层特征K、V选择和精炼细节丰富的浅层特征Q）和自注意力块。采用"训练一次，随处使用"范式，在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）上训练一次后，即可作为通用即插即用后处理器用于各种训练免费框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ARM能持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计，为训练免费的开放词汇语义分割建立了高效有效的范式。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征，有效解锁和精炼了CLIP的内部潜力，为训练免费的开放词汇语义分割提供了一种轻量级、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉的自动驾驶系统需要多样化和可扩展的训练数据，现有视频对象编辑方法在保持高视觉保真度和时间一致性方面存在困难。

Method: 基于文本到视频扩散先验，注入预训练2D编码器的时序无关潜在特征到3D解码器以恢复细节，同时采用粗粒度3D对齐和细粒度2D精化的两阶段数据对齐策略。

Result: Mirage在多种编辑场景中实现了高真实感和时间一致性，并能泛化到其他视频到视频转换任务。

Conclusion: Mirage为驾驶场景资产编辑提供了可靠的解决方案，可作为未来研究的基准。

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Motivation: 当前最先进的面部表情识别模型在多样化数据上泛化能力弱，导致在真实世界应用中性能下降，阻碍了FER作为研究领域的发展。现有方法需要跨域训练来获得泛化结果，这与真实世界应用需求相矛盾。

Method: 使用Meta-Sapiens作为骨干网络，这是一个通过大规模掩码自编码器预训练获得的人类视觉基础模型，具有出色的真实世界泛化能力。将MotivNet作为Sapiens的附加下游任务，并定义了三个评估标准：基准性能、模型相似性和数据相似性。

Conclusion: MotivNet验证了作为Sapiens下游任务的可行性，使FER在真实世界应用中更具激励性，推动了面部表情识别领域的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MotivNet, a generalizable facial emotion recognition model for robust real-world application. Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Conclusion: MambaSeg通过有效的双分支Mamba编码器和双维交互模块，成功解决了RGB-事件融合中的计算效率和时空动态建模问题，为高效、鲁棒的多模态语义分割提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Conclusion: PGMP框架有效解决了牙科CBCT金属伪影减少问题，通过物理模拟、确定性投影和医学先验知识的结合，实现了高效且临床可靠的伪影去除。

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解中存在严重依赖语言先验的问题，导致视觉未接地幻觉，特别是在处理违背常识的反事实视频时。由于文本与视频数据不平衡且反事实数据收集成本高昂，这一问题难以解决。

Method: 提出DualityForge框架：1) 使用可控扩散视频编辑将真实视频转化为反事实场景；2) 将结构化上下文信息嵌入视频编辑和QA生成过程，自动生成高质量QA对及原始-编辑视频对；3) 构建DualityVidQA大规模视频数据集；4) 提出DNA-Train两阶段训练方法（SFT-RL），在RL阶段应用成对ℓ1优势归一化实现更稳定的策略优化。

Conclusion: DualityForge框架通过合成高质量反事实视频数据，结合DNA-Train训练方法，有效解决了MLLM在视频理解中的视觉未接地幻觉问题，提高了模型对反事实场景的理解能力，并展现出良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

Motivation: 传统图像拼接技术主要使用2D单应性变换和网格变形，适用于近似共面或视差较小的场景，但在真实3D场景（多深度层和遮挡）中会导致重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真，特别是在多视图累积和360°闭环拼接场景中问题更加严重。

Method: 1. 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系下的密集3D点表示，通过置信度指标进行全局跨视图融合；2. 在3D空间中建立统一投影中心，采用等距圆柱投影将融合数据映射到单一全景流形；3. 在画布域进行空洞填充，解决视点转换揭示的未知区域，恢复连续纹理和语义一致性。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在显著视差和复杂遮挡场景中大幅减少了几何失真和重影伪影，生成了更加自然和一致的全景结果。

Conclusion: 该框架将拼接从2D变形范式重新概念化为3D一致性范式，能够灵活整合各种3D提升和补全模块，为复杂3D场景的全景拼接提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

TL;DR: EndoRare：一种基于单张参考图像的罕见胃肠道病变生成框架，通过语言引导的概念解耦分离病理特征与非诊断属性，用于AI模型增强和临床培训。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见胃肠道病变在常规内镜检查中较少见，导致可用于开发可靠AI模型和培训新手临床医生的数据有限，存在罕见疾病的数据缺口问题。

Method: 提出EndoRare框架：1）一次性、无需重新训练；2）利用语言引导的概念解耦，将病理特征与非诊断属性分离；3）将病理特征编码为可学习的原型嵌入；4）变化非诊断属性以确保多样性；5）从单张参考图像合成多样化的高保真病变样本。

Result: 1）专家评估合成图像具有临床可信度；2）用于数据增强时显著提升下游AI分类器性能，提高低假阳性率下的真阳性率；3）盲法阅读研究显示，接触EndoRare生成案例的新手内镜医生召回率提高0.400，精确率提高0.267。

Conclusion: EndoRare为罕见疾病在计算机辅助诊断和临床教育中的数据缺口问题提供了一个实用、数据高效的解决方案，能够同时提升AI模型性能和临床医生的诊断能力。

Abstract: Rare gastrointestinal lesions are infrequently encountered in routine endoscopy, restricting the data available for developing reliable artificial intelligence (AI) models and training novice clinicians. Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates. Crucially, a blinded reader study demonstrated that novice endoscopists exposed to EndoRare-generated cases achieved a 0.400 increase in recall and a 0.267 increase in precision. These results establish a practical, data-efficient pathway to bridge the rare-disease gap in both computer-aided diagnostics and clinical education.

TL;DR: 开发了Virtual-Eyes CT质量控制流程，发现其对通用基础模型有提升但对专用模型有负面影响，揭示了预处理对深度学习模型性能的差异化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT肺癌筛查的深度学习流程中，鲁棒的预处理方法很少被量化评估。需要开发临床导向的质量控制流程，并评估其对不同类型模型的影响差异。

Method: 开发Virtual-Eyes 16位CT质量控制流程：强制512x512平面分辨率、筛选诊断性序列、通过亨氏单位滤波和双侧肺覆盖评分提取连续肺块。使用765名NLST患者数据，评估RAD-DINO、Merlin、Sybil和ResNet-18在不同预处理条件下的性能。

Result: Virtual-Eyes显著提升RAD-DINO性能（切片级AUC从0.576到0.610，患者级AUC从0.646到0.683），改善校准性。但Sybil和ResNet-18性能下降（Sybil AUC从0.886到0.837），Merlin转移性有限。显示解剖学靶向QC能稳定改进通用基础模型，但可能破坏适应原始临床环境的专用模型。

Conclusion: 解剖学靶向质量控制可以稳定和改进通用基础模型工作流程，但可能破坏适应原始临床环境的专用模型。预处理对深度学习模型性能的影响具有模型特异性，需要针对模型类型进行定制化预处理策略。

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

TL;DR: UniAct是一个两阶段框架，通过微调MLLM和因果流式管道，实现人形机器人以低于500ms延迟执行多模态指令，在零样本跟踪不完美参考动作方面提升了19%成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人领域长期目标是实现能够遵循多样化多模态指令的通用智能体。现有方法难以将语言、音乐、轨迹等异构指令转换为稳定、实时的动作，高层多模态感知与全身执行之间存在显著瓶颈。

Method: 提出UniAct两阶段框架：1) 通过FSQ共享离散码本统一多模态输入，确保跨模态对齐同时将动作约束在物理可行流形上；2) 集成微调的多模态大语言模型(MLLM)与因果流式管道，实现实时动作生成。

Result: 在UniMoCap（20小时人形动作基准）上验证，实现了低于500ms的延迟，零样本跟踪不完美参考动作的成功率提升了19%，展示了在多样化现实场景中的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniAct标志着向响应式通用人形助手迈出的关键一步，通过统一感知与控制实现无缝交互，为人形机器人执行多样化多模态指令提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

TL;DR: CERES是一个用于第一人称视频中目标分割的因果推理框架，通过双模态因果干预解决语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，在Ego-RVOS基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在第一人称视频目标分割中存在困难，主要原因是：1）训练数据中对象-动作配对的偏差导致学习虚假相关性；2）第一人称视角固有的视觉混淆因素（快速运动、频繁遮挡）。这些限制使得模型难以鲁棒地分割参与人类动作的特定对象。

Method: CERES是一个插件式因果框架，采用双模态因果干预：1）后门调整：对抗从数据集统计中学习的语言表示偏见；2）前门调整：通过因果原则指导，智能整合语义视觉特征与几何深度信息，创建对第一人称扭曲更鲁棒的表征。

Result: 在Ego-RVOS基准测试中，CERES实现了最先进的性能，证明了因果推理在构建更可靠的第一人称视频理解模型方面的潜力。

Conclusion: CERES通过因果推理有效解决了第一人称视频目标分割中的语言偏见和视觉混淆问题，为更广泛的以自我为中心的视频理解任务提供了可靠的建模方法。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

TL;DR: SenseNova-MARS：通过强化学习实现多模态智能体推理与搜索框架，让视觉语言模型能够动态交错使用视觉推理和工具调用，在知识密集型视觉任务中超越GPT-5等专有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂任务中主要局限于文本链式思维或孤立工具调用，缺乏人类般的能力来无缝交错动态工具操作与连续推理，特别是在需要协调外部工具（如搜索和图像裁剪）的知识密集型视觉复杂场景中。

Method: 提出SenseNova-MARS多模态智能体推理与搜索框架，通过强化学习赋予视觉语言模型交错视觉推理和工具使用能力。框架动态集成图像搜索、文本搜索和图像裁剪工具，并提出了批量归一化组序列策略优化算法来提高训练稳定性。

Result: 在开源搜索和细粒度图像理解基准测试中达到最先进性能。在搜索导向基准测试中，SenseNova-MARS-8B在MMSearch上得分为67.84，在HR-MMSearch上得分为41.64，超越了Gemini-3-Flash和GPT-5等专有模型。

Conclusion: SenseNova-MARS通过提供有效且稳健的工具使用能力，代表了向智能体视觉语言模型发展的有希望的一步。将发布所有代码、模型和数据集以促进该领域进一步研究。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can solve complex tasks through agentic reasoning, their capabilities remain largely constrained to text-oriented chain-of-thought or isolated tool invocation. They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5. SenseNova-MARS represents a promising step toward agentic VLMs by providing effective and robust tool-use capabilities. To facilitate further research in this field, we will release all code, models, and datasets.

TL;DR: LVLDrive是一个将LiDAR点云融入视觉语言模型（VLM）的自动驾驶框架，通过渐进融合机制增强3D空间理解能力，提升驾驶决策的可靠性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于图像的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中存在瓶颈，主要问题是缺乏准确的度量空间推理和几何推断能力，导致驾驶策略不可靠。为了解决这个问题，需要引入3D度量数据来增强模型的场景理解能力。

Method: 提出LVLDrive框架，将LiDAR点云作为额外输入模态融入预训练的VLM中。采用渐进融合Q-Former逐步注入LiDAR特征，避免对预训练模型造成灾难性干扰。同时开发了空间感知问答数据集（SA-QA）来显式训练模型的3D感知和推理能力。

Result: 在多个驾驶基准测试中，LVLDrive在场景理解、度量空间感知和可靠驾驶决策方面均优于纯视觉方法，证明了3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的VLM自动驾驶系统的必要性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，显式的3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的基于VLM的自动驾驶系统至关重要。LVLDrive通过融合LiDAR点云成功提升了VLM的空间理解能力，为安全可靠的自动驾驶提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

Motivation: 受狭义相对论和量子力学启发，作者希望建立卷积神经网络信息处理与物理能量-动量关系之间的理论联系，为理解CNN的机械特性提供新视角。

Method: 将卷积核分解为正交的偶分量和奇分量，在谱域通过离散余弦变换分析，特别关注小卷积核（如3×3像素）的低频基（DC Σ和梯度分量∇）。

Result: 发现偶分量导致图像内容各向同性扩散（类似势能），奇分量导致质心方向位移（类似动能），信息位移速度与奇分量占总核能量的比率线性相关。

Conclusion: 首次建立了通用CNN信息处理与相对论物理中能量-动量关系的联系，为理解卷积滤波的机械特性提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

Motivation: 现有皮肤病图像分析数据集主要关注皮肤镜图像，缺乏患者自述查询和临床背景，限制了其在以患者为中心的护理中的应用。

Method: 引入Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS)框架，包含36个高层次和27个细粒度评估问题；扩展DermaVQA数据集为DermaVQA-DAS，支持封闭式问答和分割任务；评估多种多模态模型和提示策略。

Result: 分割任务中，不同提示策略影响性能：默认提示在Mean-of-Max和Mean-of-Mean评估中最佳，增强提示在多数投票评估中最佳（Jaccard指数0.395，Dice分数0.566）；封闭式问答中，o3模型准确率最高（0.798），GPT-4.1次之（0.796）。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS数据集和DAS框架填补了患者中心皮肤病视觉语言建模的空白，公开了数据集、框架和评估协议以加速相关研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 实时视频分析在大规模摄像头网络中运行成本高昂，现有动态模型大小选择方法无法适应多样化工作负载，特别是在移动视频和低精度目标场景下，存在采样成本过高和精度预测不准确的问题。

Method: RedunCut采用测量驱动的规划器来估计采样的成本效益权衡，并使用轻量级数据驱动的性能模型来改进精度预测，从而优化动态模型大小选择。

Conclusion: RedunCut通过解决现有动态模型大小选择方法的采样效率低下和精度预测不准确问题，实现了更高效、更通用的实时视频分析系统。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分块的方法需要完整的非因果上下文窗口，引入显著延迟，无法满足真实对话中即时非语言反馈的需求，因此需要超低延迟的实时视频生成方法

Method: 采用流匹配的自回归框架，包含两个关键设计：1) 流友好的自回归框架配合流匹配头部进行概率建模；2) 因果编码器增强，通过前瞻模块融入少量未来上下文（如60ms）提升质量同时保持低延迟

Result: 每帧生成时间仅34ms，系统总延迟低于100ms；在HDTF数据集上获得离线8.13和在线7.61的LipSync Confidence分数，达到SOTA唇同步质量

Conclusion: DyStream通过创新的因果架构设计，在保证高质量唇同步的同时实现了超低延迟，为实时对话头部视频生成提供了有效解决方案，模型、权重和代码均已开源

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency.

TL;DR: 提出基于AI的微血管吻合术自动评估框架，使用改进的TimeSformer视频Transformer进行动作识别，结合YOLO目标检测追踪提取运动特征，在58个专家标注视频上验证有效，能提供客观一致的手术技能反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术技能评估依赖专家监督，存在主观性、评估者间差异大、耗时耗力等问题，在低收入国家难以推广。需要开发自动化、可扩展的评估方法来解决这些限制。

Method: 提出AI驱动框架：1) 基于TimeSformer的视频Transformer架构，改进为分层时间注意力和加权空间注意力机制，实现精确动作识别；2) 使用YOLO目标检测和追踪方法提取细粒度运动特征，分析器械运动学；3) 从五个方面评估微血管吻合技能。

Conclusion: 该系统能够提供客观、一致且可解释的反馈，有望实现更标准化、数据驱动的手术培训与评估，解决传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

TL;DR: 提出基于DINOv2特征条件的特征到图像扩散基础模型(F2IDiff FM)，解决智能手机摄影中SISR的幻觉问题，通过低级特征提供更严格且丰富的条件控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本到图像扩散基础模型的SISR方法在智能手机摄影中存在两个问题：1) 文本特征无法准确描述图像中的细微纹理；2) 智能手机LR图像分辨率高(≥12MP)，而T2IDiff FM设计用于较小图像(<1MP)，导致需要在补丁上推理，而文本特征无法准确描述小补丁。这导致在高质量LR图像上产生不希望的幻觉。

Method: 提出特征到图像扩散基础模型(F2IDiff FM)，使用DINOv2的低级特征作为条件。低级特征提供更严格的条件控制，同时能丰富描述小图像补丁，实现最小化幻觉的生成。

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明具体实验结果，但方法旨在解决智能手机摄影中SISR的幻觉问题，通过低级特征条件实现更精确的生成控制。

Conclusion: 通过使用DINOv2低级特征作为条件的特征到图像扩散基础模型，可以更好地控制SISR中的生成过程，减少智能手机摄影中的幻觉问题，实现更忠实于原始LR图像的超分辨率重建。

Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

Motivation: 虽然对Transformer模型工作原理的洞察主要来自语言任务分析，但本研究旨在通过组合性视角探究Vision Transformer编码器学习到的表示，以理解ViT如何结构化视觉信息。

Method: 引入了一个框架来测量ViT编码器中的组合性，关键创新是使用离散小波变换获取输入依赖的视觉基元，然后通过检查组合表示能否重构原始图像表示来实证测试表示空间中的组合性程度。

Result: 研究发现，从一级DWT分解获得的基元产生的编码器表示在潜在空间中近似可组合，这表明ViT以某种可组合的方式组织视觉信息。

Conclusion: 通过组合性分析揭示了ViT表示空间的结构特性，为理解视觉Transformer如何表示和处理视觉信息提供了新的理论视角，表明DWT基元在ViT表示中具有可组合性。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间任务中多光谱太阳图像的高保真压缩面临挑战，需要在有限带宽与保持精细光谱和空间细节之间取得平衡。

Method: 提出两个互补模块：iSWGE（谱间窗口图嵌入）显式建模谱带关系，将光谱通道表示为具有学习边特征的图节点；WSGA-C（窗口空间图注意力与卷积块注意力）结合稀疏图注意力和卷积注意力，减少空间冗余并强调精细结构。

Conclusion: 该学习型压缩框架能有效平衡带宽限制与多光谱太阳图像的质量保持，为空间任务提供了一种高效的压缩解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity compression of multispectral solar imagery remains challenging for space missions, where limited bandwidth must be balanced against preserving fine spectral and spatial details. We present a learned image compression framework tailored to solar observations, leveraging two complementary modules: (1) the Inter-Spectral Windowed Graph Embedding (iSWGE), which explicitly models inter-band relationships by representing spectral channels as graph nodes with learned edge features; and (2) the Windowed Spatial Graph Attention and Convolutional Block Attention (WSGA-C), which combines sparse graph attention with convolutional attention to reduce spatial redundancy and emphasize fine-scale structures. Evaluations on the SDOML dataset across six extreme ultraviolet (EUV) channels show that our approach achieves a 20.15%reduction in Mean Spectral Information Divergence (MSID), up to 1.09% PSNR improvement, and a 1.62% log transformed MS-SSIM gain over strong learned baselines, delivering sharper and spectrally faithful reconstructions at comparable bits-per-pixel rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量网络结构搜索方法存在三个主要问题：单尺度优化无法捕捉多尺度结构、离散搜索空间阻碍平滑结构演化、结构和参数优化分离导致计算效率低下。需要一种更高效、自适应且鲁棒的张量网络结构搜索方法。

Method: 提出RGTN框架，基于重整化群思想进行多尺度搜索。核心创新包括：可学习的边门用于优化阶段拓扑修改，基于物理量的智能提议（如测量局部应力的节点张力和量化连接重要性的边信息流），从低复杂度粗尺度开始逐步细化到细尺度。

Result: 在光场数据、高阶合成张量和视频补全任务上的实验表明，RGTN达到了最先进的压缩比，运行速度比现有方法快4-600倍。

Conclusion: RGTN通过物理启发的重整化群方法有效解决了张量网络结构搜索的关键挑战，实现了高效、自适应的结构发现，为高维数据表示提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor network structure search (TN-SS) aims to automatically discover optimal network topologies and rank configurations for efficient tensor decomposition in high-dimensional data representation. Despite recent advances, existing TN-SS methods face significant limitations in computational tractability, structure adaptivity, and optimization robustness across diverse tensor characteristics. They struggle with three key challenges: single-scale optimization missing multi-scale structures, discrete search spaces hindering smooth structure evolution, and separated structure-parameter optimization causing computational inefficiency. We propose RGTN (Renormalization Group guided Tensor Network search), a physics-inspired framework transforming TN-SS via multi-scale renormalization group flows. Unlike fixed-scale discrete search methods, RGTN uses dynamic scale-transformation for continuous structure evolution across resolutions. Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations. Extensive experiments on light field data, high-order synthetic tensors, and video completion tasks show RGTN achieves state-of-the-art compression ratios and runs 4-600$\times$ faster than existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our physics-inspired approach.

<details>

Motivation: 当前AI医疗影像系统通常只输出结构化预测结果，需要放射科医生将其转化为完整的叙述性报告。大型语言模型的发展为自动生成诊断性叙述提供了新机会，旨在弥合结构化检测结果与完整放射学报告之间的差距。

Method: 开发了一个集成YOLOv5和YOLOv8进行胸部X光异常检测的管道，将检测到的边界框和类别标签输入大型语言模型（如GPT-4），生成描述性发现和临床总结。比较了两种YOLO模型在检测精度、推理延迟方面的表现，并使用余弦相似度评估生成文本与真实报告的质量。

Result: AI生成报告与人类报告在语义相似度方面表现良好。人类评估显示GPT-4在清晰度方面得分很高（4.88/5），但在自然写作流畅性方面得分较低（2.81/5），表明当前系统能达到临床准确性，但在风格上与放射科医生撰写的文本仍有区别。

Conclusion: 结合目标检测模型和大型语言模型的管道能够生成具有临床准确性的放射学报告，但在自然语言流畅性和风格方面仍需改进，以更接近放射科医生的写作质量。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频流量快速增长对带宽和存储基础设施提出更高要求，传统视频编解码器如H.264和HEVC主要针对像素域重建设计，缺乏对机器学习中心潜在表示的原生支持，限制了与深度学习管道的集成。

Method: 提出多尺度向量量化变分自编码器（MS-VQ-VAE），将VQ-VAE-2框架扩展到时空设置，引入基于3D残差卷积的两级分层潜在结构，模型轻量（约18.5M参数），针对64x64分辨率视频片段优化，并整合了基于预训练VGG16网络的感知损失。

Result: 在UCF101数据集上使用2秒视频片段（32帧，16 FPS）训练，测试集上达到25.96 dB PSNR和0.8375 SSIM，验证集上比单尺度基线提升1.41 dB PSNR和0.0248 SSIM。

Conclusion: 该框架适用于带宽敏感场景的可扩展视频压缩，包括实时流媒体、移动视频分析和CDN级存储优化，特别适合计算和内存资源受限的边缘设备部署。

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Conclusion: EVOL-SAM3通过推理时进化搜索范式成功解决了现有推理分割方法的局限性，展示了进化方法在复杂视觉语言任务中的强大潜力，为推理分割提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to localize specific objects in an image according to natural language expressions, serving as a fundamental task in vision-language understanding. However, existing VG benchmarks are mostly derived from datasets collected under clean environments, such as COCO, where scene diversity is limited. Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground. Experimental results show that our proposed RGBT-VGNet significantly outperforms these adapted methods, particularly in nighttime and long-distance scenarios. All resources will be publicly released to promote future research on robust visual grounding in complex real-world environments.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning. Our code and data are publicly available at: https://github.com/CPJ-Agricultural/CPJ-Agricultural-Diagnosis.

Conclusion: 明确优化决策模糊样本对提升CDVQA模型性能至关重要，DARFT框架通过决策模糊性引导的强化微调，无需额外监督即可有效锐化决策边界，在CDVQA任务中取得显著改进。

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

TL;DR: SliceLens：基于LLM/VLM的假设驱动框架，通过视觉推理发现细粒度错误切片，首个专为实例级视觉任务设计的FeSD基准，性能显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有切片发现方法主要针对图像分类，不适用于检测、分割、姿态估计等多实例任务；真实场景中的错误切片常涉及复杂视觉关系，现有实例级方法缺乏细粒度推理能力；当前基准偏向特定算法或图像分类，人工标注无法反映真实模型失败。

Conclusion: SliceLens通过LLM/VLM驱动的假设生成和验证，成功解决了实例级视觉任务的细粒度错误切片发现问题；FeSD基准为领域提供了更真实的评估标准；该方法不仅能发现错误模式，还能指导实际模型改进。

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Method: 提出协作低秩适应(CLoRA)，包含基础空间共享和样本无关多样性增强(SADE)组件。所有低秩模块共享一组下/上投影空间，通过共享空间获得的低秩矩阵协作构建每个LRM，SADE正则化矩阵间相似性以鼓励多样化表示。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Conclusion: 该工作推进了GUI代理在数字世界中实现类人灵巧控制，通过统一离散-连续动作建模和基于流的生成方法，解决了现有代理在连续拖拽任务上的局限性

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlowBlending是一种阶段感知的多模型采样策略，通过在不同时间步使用不同容量的模型来加速视频生成推理，同时保持大模型的视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现模型容量在不同时间步的影响不同：在早期和后期阶段至关重要，但在中间阶段基本可以忽略。这为使用混合模型策略加速推理提供了理论基础。

Method: 提出FlowBlending策略，在容量敏感阶段使用大模型，在中间阶段使用小模型。引入简单标准选择阶段边界，并使用速度-发散分析作为识别容量敏感区域的有效代理。

Result: 在LTX-Video (2B/13B)和WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B)上，FlowBlending实现了最高1.65倍的推理加速和57.35%的FLOPs减少，同时保持大模型的视觉保真度、时间连贯性和语义对齐。与现有采样加速技术兼容，可实现额外2倍加速。

Conclusion: FlowBlending通过阶段感知的混合模型策略，在显著加速视频生成推理的同时保持生成质量，为高效视频生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we show that the impact of model capacity varies across timesteps: it is crucial for the early and late stages but largely negligible during the intermediate stage. Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models. FlowBlending is also compatible with existing sampling-acceleration techniques, enabling up to 2x additional speedup.

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot是一个视频扩散模型，能够解耦空间和时间进行可控生成渲染，可以独立改变相机视角和运动序列，实现时空连续探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以独立控制视频生成中的空间（相机视角）和时间（运动序列）维度，缺乏有效的时空解耦机制来支持连续、任意的时空探索。

Method: 1. 引入动画时间嵌入机制，在扩散过程中显式控制输出视频的运动序列；2. 提出时序扭曲训练方案，利用多视角数据集模拟时间差异；3. 改进相机条件机制，允许从第一帧改变相机；4. 创建CamxTime合成数据集，提供完整的时空视频轨迹。

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的评估显示，SpaceTimePilot实现了清晰的时空解耦，相比先前工作取得了更强的结果，能够精确控制相机视角和运动序列。

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot通过创新的时间嵌入机制、训练方案和数据集，成功实现了视频生成中空间和时间的解耦控制，为连续时空探索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

TL;DR: EchoFoley提出视频声音生成新任务，通过符号化事件表示实现细粒度控制，构建大规模数据集，并开发基于慢-快思考策略的生成框架，显著提升控制性和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频-文本到音频（VT2A）方法存在三个主要问题：1）视觉与文本条件不平衡导致视觉主导；2）缺乏细粒度可控生成的具体定义；3）指令理解和跟随能力弱，现有数据集依赖简短的分类标签。

Method: 提出EchoFoley任务，使用符号化声音事件表示（指定何时、什么、如何产生声音），构建EchoFoley-6k大规模专家标注数据集，并开发EchoVidia框架，采用慢-快思考策略进行以声音事件为中心的代理生成。

Result: 实验显示EchoVidia在可控性上比现有VT2A模型提升40.7%，在感知质量上提升12.5%。

Conclusion: EchoFoley通过符号化事件表示和分层语义控制解决了现有VT2A方法的局限性，为视频声音生成提供了更精细的控制能力和更好的指令跟随性能。

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架有效解决了多视图标签不一致问题，通过特征嵌入和边界硬挖掘策略实现了高效且高质量的3D实例分割，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Method: 提出投影式对抗攻击方法，将扰动光线投影到目标物体上；采用物理在环优化，在实际环境中评估候选解以考虑设备规格和干扰；使用分布式协方差矩阵自适应进化策略

Result: 实验证实该方法成功创建了导致深度估计错误的对抗样本，使目标场景中的物体部分消失

Conclusion: 该方法验证了基于DNN的单目深度估计模型的脆弱性，为实际应用中的鲁棒性增强提供了重要参考

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CropTrack是一个用于农业场景的多目标跟踪框架，通过结合外观和运动信息，解决了农业环境中目标相似、频繁遮挡等挑战，在身份保持和关联准确性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中的多目标跟踪面临重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡等挑战。现有跟踪器主要依赖运动信息，但在目标频繁强遮挡时难以保持身份一致性，而农业场景中目标高度相似使得外观关联难以整合。

Method: CropTrack提出一个结合外观和运动信息的MOT框架，包含：1) 重排序增强的外观关联；2) 基于外观冲突解决的一对多关联策略；3) 指数移动平均原型特征库来改进外观关联。

Result: 在公开农业MOT数据集上评估，CropTrack展现出持续的身份保持能力，优于传统基于运动的跟踪方法。与最先进方法相比，在识别F1分数和关联准确率上有显著提升，且身份切换次数更少。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效整合外观和运动信息，成功解决了农业场景中多目标跟踪的挑战，特别是在目标高度相似和频繁遮挡的情况下，实现了更好的身份保持和跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLN-MME评估框架，用于系统评估多模态大语言模型在具身导航任务中的零样本能力，发现增强推理链和自反思反而导致性能下降，揭示了MLLMs在3D空间推理和上下文感知方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务上表现出色，但其作为具身智能体（需要多轮对话、空间推理和顺序动作预测）的性能仍需探索。本文旨在系统评估MLLMs在视觉语言导航任务中的零样本能力。

Method: 提出了VLN-MME评估框架，将传统导航数据集标准化为统一基准。采用高度模块化和可访问的设计，支持跨不同MLLM架构、智能体设计和导航任务的结构化比较和组件级消融实验。

Result: 意外发现：增强基线智能体（添加推理链和自反思）反而导致性能下降。这表明MLLMs在具身导航任务中上下文感知能力差，虽然能遵循指令并结构化输出，但3D空间推理保真度低。

Conclusion: VLN-MME为系统评估通用MLLMs在具身导航环境中的能力奠定了基础，揭示了其在顺序决策能力方面的局限性。这些发现为MLLMs作为具身智能体的后训练提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Conclusion: OFL-SAM2通过消除对人工提示的依赖并利用有限标注数据，为医学图像分割提供了一种标签高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has demonstrated remarkable promptable visual segmentation capabilities in video data, showing potential for extension to medical image segmentation (MIS) tasks involving 3D volumes and temporally correlated 2D image sequences. However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

TL;DR: ProDM：一种基于扩散模型的生成框架，用于从非门控CT中恢复无运动钙化病变，提高冠状动脉钙化评分准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非门控胸部CT中的冠状动脉钙化评分受到心脏和呼吸运动伪影的严重影响，而ECG门控心脏CT在人群筛查和常规成像中应用有限。需要一种方法来从常规非门控CT中准确量化CAC。

Method: 提出ProDM（属性感知渐进校正扩散模型），包含三个关键组件：1）CAC运动模拟数据引擎，从心脏门控CT合成具有多样化运动轨迹的现实非门控采集数据；2）属性感知学习策略，通过可微钙化一致性损失融入钙化特定先验；3）渐进校正方案，在扩散步骤中逐步减少伪影。

Conclusion: ProDM展示了渐进、属性感知框架在从常规胸部CT成像中进行可靠CAC量化的潜力，为非门控CT的CAC评分提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统L-ReID方法需要为历史图库图像重新提取特征（重新索引），但面临数据隐私问题和计算成本高的问题，导致新旧模型特征不兼容，影响重识别性能。

Method: 提出双向连续兼容表示（Bi-C2R）框架，持续更新旧模型提取的图库特征，实现新旧模型特征的相互兼容，避免重新索引。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，Bi-C2R方法在RFL-ReID新任务和传统L-ReID任务上均取得领先性能。

Conclusion: RFL-ReID是比L-ReID更具挑战性的新任务，Bi-C2R框架能有效解决特征兼容性问题，实现无需重新索引的终身行人重识别。

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前基于光流的SLAM方法缺乏几何一致性，导致跟踪和建图不够准确和鲁棒。需要将光流估计与几何推理相结合，利用基础深度模型的指导来提升性能。

Abstract: We present FoundationSLAM, a learning-based monocular dense SLAM system that addresses the absence of geometric consistency in previous flow-based approaches for accurate and robust tracking and mapping. Our core idea is to bridge flow estimation with geometric reasoning by leveraging the guidance from foundation depth models. To this end, we first develop a Hybrid Flow Network that produces geometry-aware correspondences, enabling consistent depth and pose inference across diverse keyframes. To enforce global consistency, we propose a Bi-Consistent Bundle Adjustment Layer that jointly optimizes keyframe pose and depth under multi-view constraints. Furthermore, we introduce a Reliability-Aware Refinement mechanism that dynamically adapts the flow update process by distinguishing between reliable and uncertain regions, forming a closed feedback loop between matching and optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FoundationSLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and dense reconstruction quality across multiple challenging datasets, while running in real-time at 18 FPS, demonstrating strong generalization to various scenarios and practical applicability of our method.

TL;DR: 提出自引导视觉配音框架，将视觉配音从不适定的修复任务转化为条件良好的视频编辑问题，通过DiT生成理想训练数据并训练音频驱动编辑器，实现精准唇形同步和身份保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉配音方法面临缺乏理想训练数据的问题（需要仅唇形不同而其他视觉条件完全相同的配对视频），现有基于掩码修复的方法需要同时生成缺失内容和同步唇形，导致视觉伪影、身份漂移和同步效果差。

Method: 1. 使用扩散变换器作为数据生成器，为每个真实样本合成唇形改变的伴生视频，形成视觉对齐的视频对；2. 训练基于DiT的音频驱动编辑器，利用完整对齐的输入视频帧专注于精确的音频驱动唇形修改；3. 引入时间步自适应多阶段学习策略，解耦不同扩散时间步的编辑目标冲突；4. 提出ContextDubBench基准数据集用于鲁棒评估。

Result: 该方法实现了高度准确的唇形同步、忠实的身份保持，并在具有挑战性的野外场景中表现出卓越的鲁棒性。多阶段学习策略促进了稳定训练，增强了唇形同步和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉配音重新定义为视频到视频编辑问题，并提供完整、帧对齐的输入条件，该方法从根本上实现了高质量的唇形同步和身份保持，为实际应用场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FineTec：一个用于时间损坏骨架序列细粒度动作识别的统一框架，通过上下文感知补全、空间分解和物理驱动估计来恢复时空信息，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中在线姿态估计常产生大量缺失数据，现有方法难以准确恢复时间动态和细粒度空间结构，导致丢失区分相似动作的关键细微运动线索。

Method: 1) 使用上下文感知补全和多样化时间掩码从损坏输入恢复基础骨架序列；2) 空间分解模块将骨架分为五个语义区域，根据运动方差分为动态和静态子组，通过针对性扰动生成两个增强序列；3) 物理驱动估计模块利用拉格朗日动力学估计关节加速度；4) 融合骨架位置序列和加速度序列输入GCN动作识别头。

Result: 在粗粒度（NTU-60, NTU-120）和细粒度（Gym99, Gym288）基准测试中，FineTec在各种时间损坏级别下显著优于先前方法。在Gym99-severe和Gym288-severe设置下分别达到89.1%和78.1%的top-1准确率。

Conclusion: FineTec通过统一的时空恢复和物理驱动建模框架，有效解决了时间损坏骨架序列的细粒度动作识别问题，展示了强大的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Edit3r：单次前馈框架，从无位姿、视角不一致的指令编辑图像中重建和编辑3D场景，无需逐场景优化或位姿估计，实现快速逼真渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D编辑方法需要逐场景优化，计算成本高且慢。需要一种能够直接从编辑图像预测3D编辑的快速方法，但缺乏多视角一致的编辑图像作为监督数据。

Method: 1) 使用SAM2重着色策略生成可靠的跨视角一致监督数据；2) 采用非对称输入策略，将重着色参考视图与原始辅助视图配对，鼓励网络融合和对齐不同观察；3) 在推理时能处理2D方法编辑的图像。

Result: 在DL3DV-Edit-Bench基准测试中，Edit3r相比现有基线方法在语义对齐和3D一致性方面表现更优，推理速度显著更快，适用于实时3D编辑应用。

Conclusion: Edit3r实现了快速、逼真的3D场景编辑，无需逐场景优化或位姿估计，通过创新的监督生成策略解决了训练数据缺乏的问题，在语义对齐和3D一致性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present Edit3r, a feed-forward framework that reconstructs and edits 3D scenes in a single pass from unposed, view-inconsistent, instruction-edited images. Unlike prior methods requiring per-scene optimization, Edit3r directly predicts instruction-aligned 3D edits, enabling fast and photorealistic rendering without optimization or pose estimation. A key challenge in training such a model lies in the absence of multi-view consistent edited images for supervision. We address this with (i) a SAM2-based recoloring strategy that generates reliable, cross-view-consistent supervision, and (ii) an asymmetric input strategy that pairs a recolored reference view with raw auxiliary views, encouraging the network to fuse and align disparate observations. At inference, our model effectively handles images edited by 2D methods such as InstructPix2Pix, despite not being exposed to such edits during training. For large-scale quantitative evaluation, we introduce DL3DV-Edit-Bench, a benchmark built on the DL3DV test split, featuring 20 diverse scenes, 4 edit types and 100 edits in total. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative results show that Edit3r achieves superior semantic alignment and enhanced 3D consistency compared to recent baselines, while operating at significantly higher inference speed, making it promising for real-time 3D editing applications.

TL;DR: GaMO通过多视角外推而非生成新视角来改进稀疏视图3D重建，在保持几何一致性的同时扩展场景覆盖，实现了25倍加速和SOTA重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在稀疏视图3D重建中存在三个关键问题：已知视图外围覆盖不足、生成视图间的几何不一致性、以及计算成本高昂的流程。

Method: 提出GaMO框架，通过多视角外推从现有相机姿态扩展视场，采用多视角条件化和几何感知去噪策略，以零样本方式无需训练。

Result: 在Replica和ScanNet++数据集上，3、6、9个输入视图下均达到SOTA重建质量（PSNR和LPIPS），相比SOTA扩散方法实现25倍加速，处理时间低于10分钟。

Conclusion: GaMO通过多视角外推重新定义稀疏视图重建，在保持几何一致性的同时提供更广场景覆盖，显著提升了重建质量和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Motivation: 如何设计自动化流程，将OCR、基于LLM的解释和数据库链接相结合，以协调历史文档图像数据与现有高质量数据库记录？这解决了数字人文学科中处理历史文档的挑战。

Method: 应用OCR技术、生成式AI解码约束（结构化数据提取）和数据库链接方法，将打字机历史记录处理为数字格式。使用记录链接算法连接JSON文件与数据库。

Result: OCR字符错误率1.08%，单词错误率5.06%。从OCR文本提取JSON的平均准确率为63%，基于标注OCR为65%。记录链接算法对标注JSON文件准确率达94%，对OCR衍生JSON文件达81%。

Conclusion: 研究为数字人文学科提供了自动化历史文档解释流程，解决了布局可变性和术语差异等挑战，探索了先进生成式AI模型的适用性和能力，表明生成式AI能在一定程度上纠正低OCR性能。

Abstract: This research digitizes and analyzes the Leidse hoogleraren en lectoren 1575-1815 books written between 1983 and 1985, which contain biographic data about professors and curators of Leiden University. It addresses the central question: how can we design an automated pipeline that integrates OCR, LLM-based interpretation, and database linking to harmonize data from historical document images with existing high-quality database records? We applied OCR techniques, generative AI decoding constraints that structure data extraction, and database linkage methods to process typewritten historical records into a digital format. OCR achieved a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.08 percent and a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.06 percent, while JSON extraction from OCR text achieved an average accuracy of 63 percent and, based on annotated OCR, 65 percent. This indicates that generative AI somewhat corrects low OCR performance. Our record linkage algorithm linked annotated JSON files with 94% accuracy and OCR-derived JSON files with 81%. This study contributes to digital humanities research by offering an automated pipeline for interpreting digitized historical documents, addressing challenges like layout variability and terminology differences, and exploring the applicability and strength of an advanced generative AI model.

TL;DR: CAT框架通过一致性-准确率关系曲线和CORE指数，评估LLMs在可控输入变化下的准确率与响应一致性的相互作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估主要关注准确率或基准分数，最近开始考虑一致性作为重要属性。作者认为除了独立评估这两个维度外，还需要考虑它们之间的相互依赖关系，以实现更细致的模型评估。

Method: 提出CAT框架，核心是"一致性-准确率关系(CAR)曲线"，可视化模型准确率随一致性要求增加的变化。使用"最小一致性准确率(MCA)"度量，并提出"面向一致性的鲁棒性估计(CORE)"指数，结合CAR曲线的面积和形状来量化准确率与一致性的权衡。

Result: 在多个通用和专业领域LLMs上，使用多项选择题基准进行了实际演示。框架可扩展到多项选择任务之外，通过适应性评分函数支持长文本、开放式评估。

Conclusion: CAT框架提供了一种系统方法来评估LLMs的准确率与一致性之间的相互作用，为模型部署到高风险实际应用提供了更全面的评估视角。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{CAT}, a framework designed to evaluate and visualize the \emph{interplay} of \emph{accuracy} and \emph{response consistency} of Large Language Models (LLMs) under controllable input variations, using multiple-choice (MC) benchmarks as a case study. Current evaluation practices primarily focus on model capabilities such as accuracy or benchmark scores and, more recently, measuring consistency is being considered an essential property for deploying LLMs in high-stake, real-world applications. We argue in this paper that although both dimensions should still be evaluated independently, their inter-dependency also need to be considered for a more nuanced evaluation of LLMs. At the core of \textsc{CAT} are the \emph{Consistency-Accuracy Relation (CAR)} curves, which visualize how model accuracy varies with increasing consistency requirements, as defined by the \emph{Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (MCA)} metric. We further propose the \emph{Consistency-Oriented Robustness Estimate (CORE)} index, a global metric that combines the area and shape of the CAR curve to quantify the trade-off between accuracy and consistency. We present a practical demonstration of our framework across a diverse set of generalist and domain-specific LLMs, evaluated on multiple MC benchmarks. We also outline how \textsc{CAT} can be extended beyond MC tasks to support long-form, open-ended evaluations through adaptable scoring functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在结构化数据生成中应用增多，但输出一致性对生产应用至关重要，需要系统性的评估和改进框架。

Method: 提出STED（语义树编辑距离）指标，平衡语义灵活性和结构严格性；构建一致性评分框架，聚合多次生成的STED测量结果。

Result: STED在合成数据集上表现优异（语义等价相似度0.86-0.90，结构断裂为0.0），优于TED、BERTScore和DeepDiff。Claude-3.7-Sonnet一致性最佳，Claude-3-Haiku和Nova-Pro需调优。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM生产系统中的可靠结构化输出生成提供理论基础和实用工具，支持模型选择、提示优化和问题诊断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for structured data generation, yet output consistency remains critical for production applications. We introduce a comprehensive framework for evaluating and improving consistency in LLM-generated structured outputs. Our approach combines: (1) STED (Semantic Tree Edit Distance), a novel similarity metric balancing semantic flexibility with structural strictness when comparing JSON outputs, and (2) a consistency scoring framework aggregating multiple STED measurements across repeated generations to quantify reliability. Through systematic experiments on synthetic datasets with controlled schema, expression, and semantic variations, we demonstrate STED achieves superior performance ($0.86-0.90$ similarity for semantic equivalents, $0.0$ for structural breaks) compared to existing metrics including TED, BERTScore, and DeepDiff. Applying our framework to benchmark six LLMs reveals significant variations: Claude-3.7-Sonnet demonstrates exceptional consistency, maintaining near-perfect structural reliability even at high temperatures ($T=0.9$), while models like Claude-3-Haiku and Nova-Pro exhibit substantial degradation requiring careful tuning. Our framework enables practical applications including targeted model selection for structured tasks, iterative prompt refinement for reproducible results, and diagnostic analysis to identify inconsistency root causes. This work provides theoretical foundations and practical tools for ensuring reliable structured output generation in LLM-based production systems.

Abstract: LLMs excel at code generation from English prompts, but this progress has not extended to low-resource languages. We address Bangla-to-Python code generation by introducing BanglaCodeAct, an agent-based framework that leverages multi-agent prompting and iterative self-correction. Unlike prior approaches relying on task-specific fine-tuning, BanglaCodeAct employs an open-source multilingual LLM within a Thought-Code-Observation loop, enabling dynamic generation, testing, and refinement of code from Bangla instructions. We benchmark several small-parameter open-source LLMs and evaluate their effectiveness on the mHumanEval dataset for Bangla NL2Code. Our results show that Qwen3-8B, when deployed with BanglaCodeAct, achieves the best performance, with pass@1 accuracy of 94.0\% on the development set and 71.6\% on the blind test set. These results establish a new benchmark for Bangla-to-Python translation and highlight the potential of agent-based reasoning for reliable code generation in low-resource languages.

Motivation: 现有文档理解模型在真实世界噪声OCR和异构模板下的性能评估不足，特别是在药品等安全关键领域需要可靠的基准测试。

Method: 构建PharmaShip数据集，包含扫描药品运输单据，采用实体中心评估协议，基准测试五种代表性模型（LiLT、LayoutLMv3-base、GeoLayoutLM等），并标准化预处理、分割和优化。

Result: 像素信息和显式几何信息提供互补的归纳偏置，但单独都不够；注入阅读顺序导向的正则化能持续改进SER和EL；ROP在单词级别准确但在片段级别有挑战；更长的位置覆盖能稳定后期页面预测。

Conclusion: PharmaShip为药品领域安全关键文档理解建立了可控、可复现的基准，并突显序列感知约束作为结构建模的可迁移偏置的重要性。

Abstract: We present PharmaShip, a real-world Chinese dataset of scanned pharmaceutical shipping documents designed to stress-test pre-trained text-layout models under noisy OCR and heterogeneous templates. PharmaShip covers three complementary tasks-sequence entity recognition (SER), relation extraction (RE), and reading order prediction (ROP)-and adopts an entity-centric evaluation protocol to minimize confounds across architectures. We benchmark five representative baselines spanning pixel-aware and geometry-aware families (LiLT, LayoutLMv3-base, GeoLayoutLM and their available RORE-enhanced variants), and standardize preprocessing, splits, and optimization. Experiments show that pixels and explicit geometry provide complementary inductive biases, yet neither alone is sufficient: injecting reading-order-oriented regularization consistently improves SER and EL and yields the most robust configuration, while longer positional coverage stabilizes late-page predictions and reduces truncation artifacts. ROP is accurate at the word level but challenging at the segment level, reflecting boundary ambiguity and long-range crossings. PharmaShip thus establishes a controlled, reproducible benchmark for safety-critical document understanding in the pharmaceutical domain and highlights sequence-aware constraints as a transferable bias for structure modeling. We release the dataset at https://github.com/KevinYuLei/PharmaShip.

Abstract: This paper introduces the Luca-Noise Reflex Protocol (LN-RP), a computational framework for analyzing noise-driven persona emergence in large language models. By injecting stochastic noise seeds into the initial generation state, we observe nonlinear transitions in linguistic behavior across 152 generation cycles. Our results reveal three stable persona modes with distinct entropy signatures, and demonstrate that external noise sources can reliably induce phase transitions in reflexive generation dynamics. Quantitative evaluation confirms consistent persona retention and significant differences across modes (p < 0.01). The protocol provides a reproducible method for studying reflexive generation, emergent behavior, and longrange linguistic coherence in LLMs.

Method: 引入HarmTransform多智能体辩论框架，通过多个智能体之间的迭代批评和精炼，系统地将有害查询转化为更隐蔽的形式，同时保留其底层有害意图

Result: 实验表明HarmTransform在生成有效查询转化方面显著优于标准基线，但辩论具有双刃剑效应：能提高隐蔽性但也可能引入主题偏移和不必要的复杂性

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论在生成全面安全训练数据方面既有前景也有局限性，需要平衡隐蔽性提升与复杂性控制

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with safety mechanisms to detect and block harmful queries, yet current alignment approaches primarily focus on overtly dangerous content and overlook more subtle threats. However, users can often disguise harmful intent through covert rephrasing that preserves malicious objectives while appearing benign, which creates a significant gap in existing safety training data. To address this limitation, we introduce HarmTransform, a multi-agent debate framework for systematically transforming harmful queries into stealthier forms while preserving their underlying harmful intent. Our framework leverages iterative critique and refinement among multiple agents to generate high-quality, covert harmful query transformations that can be used to improve future LLM safety alignment. Experiments demonstrate that HarmTransform significantly outperforms standard baselines in producing effective query transformations. At the same time, our analysis reveals that debate acts as a double-edged sword: while it can sharpen transformations and improve stealth, it may also introduce topic shifts and unnecessary complexity. These insights highlight both the promise and the limitations of multi-agent debate for generating comprehensive safety training data.

Motivation: 扩展LLM在完美信息游戏中形成世界模型的研究到不完全信息领域，以扑克作为典型的部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程，探索LLM在随机环境中是否能学习到环境表示。

Method: 在扑克手牌历史数据上预训练GPT风格模型，然后探测其内部激活，主要使用非线性探针来解码模型学习到的表示。

Result: 模型在没有明确指导的情况下学习到了确定性结构（如手牌等级）和随机性特征（如胜率），这些表示可解码且与理论信念状态相关。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning abilities across diverse fields, from solving programming challenges to competing in strategy-intensive games such as chess. Prior work has shown that LLMs can develop emergent world models in games of perfect information, where internal representations correspond to latent states of the environment. In this paper, we extend this line of investigation to domains of incomplete information, focusing on poker as a canonical partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We pretrain a GPT-style model on Poker Hand History (PHH) data and probe its internal activations. Our results demonstrate that the model learns both deterministic structure, such as hand ranks, and stochastic features, such as equity, without explicit instruction. Furthermore, by using primarily nonlinear probes, we demonstrated that these representations are decodeable and correlate with theoretical belief states, suggesting that LLMs are learning their own representation of the stochastic environment of Texas Hold'em Poker.

TL;DR: 提出兩階段框架處理線上性別歧視內容檢測，結合針對性訓練與推理式推論，在多個基準測試中取得SOTA結果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 線上性別歧視內容日益隱晦且依賴上下文，傳統檢測方法難以應對。數據存在標籤稀缺、類別不平衡、概念模糊等問題，導致模型決策邊界不穩定，忽略細微的歧視形式。

Method: 兩階段框架：1) 訓練階段使用類別平衡焦點損失、類別感知批次處理和後設閾值校準來處理標籤不平衡和噪聲監督；2) 推論階段採用動態路由機制，高置信度案例直接分類，不確定案例則交由協作專家判斷模組，該模組使用多個角色進行推理並由法官模型整合。

Result: 在多個基準測試中取得最佳結果：EXIST 2025 Task 1.1 F1提升2.72%，EDOS Tasks A提升4.48%，Task B提升1.30%。

Conclusion: 該框架能有效處理線上性別歧視檢測中的數據稀缺、噪聲和概念模糊問題，通過結合針對性訓練和推理式推論，顯著提升檢測性能。

Abstract: Sexist content online increasingly appears in subtle, context-dependent forms that evade traditional detection methods. Its interpretation often depends on overlapping linguistic, psychological, legal, and cultural dimensions, which produce mixed and sometimes contradictory signals, even in annotated datasets. These inconsistencies, combined with label scarcity and class imbalance, result in unstable decision boundaries and cause fine-tuned models to overlook subtler, underrepresented forms of harm. Together, these limitations point to the need for a design that explicitly addresses the combined effects of (i) underrepresentation, (ii) noise, and (iii) conceptual ambiguity in both data and model predictions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework that unifies (i) targeted training procedures to adapt supervision to scarce and noisy data with (ii) selective, reasoning-based inference to handle ambiguous or borderline cases. Our training setup applies class-balanced focal loss, class-aware batching, and post-hoc threshold calibration to mitigate label imbalance and noisy supervision. At inference time, a dynamic routing mechanism classifies high-confidence cases directly and escalates uncertain instances to a novel \textit{Collaborative Expert Judgment} (CEJ) module, which prompts multiple personas and consolidates their reasoning through a judge model. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results across several benchmarks, with a +2.72\% improvement in F1 on the EXIST 2025 Task 1.1, and a gains of +4.48\% and +1.30\% on the EDOS Tasks A and B, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 家庭服务机器人面临的核心挑战是缺乏常识推理能力来推断日常物品（如盘子）在抽屉、橱柜等隐藏位置的存储位置，需要开发能够理解家庭组织逻辑的认知能力。

Method: 提出NOAM（非可见物品分配模型）混合代理管道，将视觉输入转换为自然语言描述（空间上下文和可见容器），然后提示大型语言模型（如GPT-4）推断最可能的隐藏存储位置。

Result: NOAM在预测准确性上显著优于随机选择、视觉语言管道、领先的多模态模型等基线方法，接近人类性能水平，展示了在家庭环境中部署认知能力代理的最佳实践。

Conclusion: 存储家居物品挑战为评估服务机器人认知能力提供了重要基准，NOAM模型通过结合结构化场景理解和LLM推理，实现了接近人类的常识推理能力，为家庭服务机器人的实际部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: ``Bring me a plate.'' For domestic service robots, this simple command reveals a complex challenge: inferring where everyday items are stored, often out of sight in drawers, cabinets, or closets. Despite advances in vision and manipulation, robots still lack the commonsense reasoning needed to complete this task. We introduce the Stored Household Item Challenge, a benchmark task for evaluating service robots' cognitive capabilities: given a household scene and a queried item, predict its most likely storage location.
  Our benchmark includes two datasets: (1) a real-world evaluation set of 100 item-image pairs with human-annotated ground truth from participants' kitchens, and (2) a development set of 6,500 item-image pairs annotated with storage polygons over public kitchen images. These datasets support realistic modeling of household organization and enable comparative evaluation across agent architectures.
  To begin tackling this challenge, we introduce NOAM (Non-visible Object Allocation Model), a hybrid agent pipeline that combines structured scene understanding with large language model inference. NOAM converts visual input into natural language descriptions of spatial context and visible containers, then prompts a language model (e.g., GPT-4) to infer the most likely hidden storage location. This integrated vision-language agent exhibits emergent commonsense reasoning and is designed for modular deployment within broader robotic systems.
  We evaluate NOAM against baselines including random selection, vision-language pipelines (Grounding-DINO + SAM), leading multimodal models (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4o, Kosmos-2, LLaMA, Qwen), and human performance. NOAM significantly improves prediction accuracy and approaches human-level results, highlighting best practices for deploying cognitively capable agents in domestic environments.

TL;DR: EASD通过引入基于熵的动态惩罚机制改进推测解码，在保持效率的同时可能超越目标模型的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码中草稿模型与目标模型过度对齐，限制了性能提升空间，无法超越目标模型本身的能力

Method: 在标准推测解码基础上加入动态熵惩罚：当两个模型都呈现高熵且top-N预测重叠时，拒绝当前token并由目标模型重新采样

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，EASD始终优于现有推测解码方法，并且在大多数情况下超越了目标LLM本身的性能

Conclusion: EASD通过草稿模型验证机制，在保持与标准推测解码相当的效率的同时，实现了超越目标模型性能的可能性

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates large language model (LLM) reasoning by using a small draft model to generate candidate tokens, which the target LLM either accepts directly or regenerates upon rejection. However, excessive alignment between the draft and target models constrains SD to the performance of the target LLM. To address this limitation, we propose Entropy-Aware Speculative Decoding (EASD), a training-free enhancement. Building on standard SD, EASD incorporates a dynamic entropy-based penalty. At each decoding step, we employ the entropy of the sampling distribution to quantify model uncertainty. When both models exhibit high entropy with substantial overlap among their top-N predictions, the corresponding token is rejected and re-sampled by the target LLM. This penalty prevents low-confidence errors from propagating. By incorporating draft-model verification, EASD enables the possibility of surpassing the target model's inherent performance. Experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EASD consistently outperforms existing SD methods and, in most cases, surpasses the target LLM itself. We further prove that the efficiency of EASD is comparable to that of SD. The code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.

TL;DR: MiMo-Audio通过大规模音频预训练（超1亿小时数据）实现了音频任务的少样本学习能力，在语音智能和音频理解基准测试中达到开源SOTA，并能泛化到训练数据中未见的任务。


<details>

Motivation: 现有音频语言模型通常需要任务特定的微调，而人类能够通过少量示例或简单指令泛化到新音频任务。受GPT-3在文本领域的启发，研究者认为这种通过扩展预训练实现泛化的范式同样适用于音频领域。

Method: 1. 将MiMo-Audio的预训练数据扩展到超过1亿小时音频数据；2. 在后期训练阶段，构建多样化的指令调优语料库；3. 在音频理解和生成中引入思维机制；4. 开发系统性的评估框架来测试少样本学习能力。

Conclusion: 通过大规模音频预训练可以实现类似GPT-3在文本领域的泛化能力，MiMo-Audio展示了音频语言模型在少样本学习、任务泛化和音频生成方面的强大潜力，为通用音频智能系统的发展提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models.

TL;DR: StressRoBERTa：一种跨条件迁移学习方法，通过持续训练与慢性压力相关的临床疾病（抑郁、焦虑、PTSD）数据，在推特上自动检测自我报告的慢性压力，性能优于通用语言模型和一般心理健康模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性压力是重要的公共卫生问题，社交媒体如推特成为人们分享经历的重要平台。现有方法在检测慢性压力方面存在局限，需要探索如何利用临床相关条件的数据来提升检测性能。

Method: 提出StressRoBERTa方法：1）使用与慢性压力高度共病的临床相关条件（抑郁、焦虑、PTSD）数据进行持续训练；2）在Stress-SMHD语料库（1.08亿词）上持续训练RoBERTa；3）在SMM4H 2022 Task 8数据集上进行微调。

Result: StressRoBERTa在SMM4H 2022 Task 8上达到82%的F1分数，比最佳共享任务系统（79%）高出3个百分点。相比原始RoBERTa提升1% F1。在Dreaddit数据集上达到81% F1，证明从临床心理健康情境到情境压力讨论的有效迁移。

Conclusion: 聚焦于压力相关疾病的跨条件迁移学习比一般心理健康训练提供更强的表示能力，能够有效提升社交媒体上慢性压力的自动检测性能，并具有从临床环境到情境讨论的良好迁移能力。

Abstract: The prevalence of chronic stress represents a significant public health concern, with social media platforms like Twitter serving as important venues for individuals to share their experiences. This paper introduces StressRoBERTa, a cross-condition transfer learning approach for automatic detection of self-reported chronic stress in English tweets. The investigation examines whether continual training on clinically related conditions (depression, anxiety, PTSD), disorders with high comorbidity with chronic stress, improves stress detection compared to general language models and broad mental health models. RoBERTa is continually trained on the Stress-SMHD corpus (108M words from users with self-reported diagnoses of depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and fine-tuned on the SMM4H 2022 Task 8 dataset. StressRoBERTa achieves 82% F1-score, outperforming the best shared task system (79% F1) by 3 percentage points. The results demonstrate that focused cross-condition transfer from stress-related disorders (+1% F1 over vanilla RoBERTa) provides stronger representations than general mental health training. Evaluation on Dreaddit (81% F1) further demonstrates transfer from clinical mental health contexts to situational stress discussions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然自动偏见检测在新闻分析中被广泛使用，但人们对其决策机制和失败原因知之甚少。本研究旨在通过可解释性分析来理解不同偏见检测模型如何运作以及为何出错。

Method: 使用SHAP解释方法对两种Transformer模型进行对比研究：1）在BABE数据集上微调的偏见检测器；2）在BABE数据集上微调的领域自适应预训练RoBERTa模型。分析正确和错误预测中的词级归因，以表征不同模型架构如何操作化语言偏见。

Result: 两种模型都关注相似的评价性语言类别，但在如何将这些信号整合到预测中存在显著差异。偏见检测器模型对误报赋予更强的内部证据，导致对中性新闻内容的系统性过度标记。领域自适应模型表现出与预测结果更一致的归因模式，误报减少63%。模型错误源于不同的语言机制，误报主要由话语层面的模糊性而非显性偏见线索驱动。

Conclusion: 可解释性感知的评估对偏见检测系统至关重要，架构和训练选择会显著影响模型在新闻环境中的可靠性和部署适用性。领域自适应方法比专用偏见检测器表现更好，能更准确地识别真正的偏见信号。

Abstract: Automated bias detection in news text is heavily used to support journalistic analysis and media accountability, yet little is known about how bias detection models arrive at their decisions or why they fail. In this work, we present a comparative interpretability study of two transformer-based bias detection models: a bias detector fine-tuned on the BABE dataset and a domain-adapted pre-trained RoBERTa model fine-tuned on the BABE dataset, using SHAP-based explanations. We analyze word-level attributions across correct and incorrect predictions to characterize how different model architectures operationalize linguistic bias. Our results show that although both models attend to similar categories of evaluative language, they differ substantially in how these signals are integrated into predictions. The bias detector model assigns stronger internal evidence to false positives than to true positives, indicating a misalignment between attribution strength and prediction correctness and contributing to systematic over-flagging of neutral journalistic content. In contrast, the domain-adaptive model exhibits attribution patterns that better align with prediction outcomes and produces 63\% fewer false positives. We further demonstrate that model errors arise from distinct linguistic mechanisms, with false positives driven by discourse-level ambiguity rather than explicit bias cues. These findings highlight the importance of interpretability-aware evaluation for bias detection systems and suggest that architectural and training choices critically affect both model reliability and deployment suitability in journalistic contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一种自适应提示策略，通过将检索信息分割成小块并顺序提示LLM，在保持性能的同时减少token使用量，并发现LLM在信息不足时倾向于生成错误答案而非拒绝回答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型上下文窗口的扩展，检索增强生成中使用了更广泛的上下文。虽然更长的上下文更容易包含目标知识，但也引入了更多无关信息，这会阻碍模型的生成过程并降低其性能。

Method: 设计自适应提示策略：将检索信息分割成较小的块，然后顺序提示LLM使用每个块来回答问题。通过调整块大小，可以在包含相关信息与减少无关信息之间进行权衡。

Result: 在三个开放域问答数据集上的实验结果表明，自适应策略在使用更少token的情况下，性能与标准提示相当。分析发现，当遇到信息不足时，LLM通常会生成错误答案而不是拒绝回答，这是主要的错误来源。

Conclusion: 自适应策略能有效平衡相关信息与无关信息的权衡。研究强调需要进一步研究增强LLM在面对信息不足时有效拒绝请求的能力。

Abstract: The success of expanded context windows in Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven increased use of broader context in retrieval-augmented generation. We investigate the use of LLMs for retrieval augmented question answering. While longer contexts make it easier to incorporate targeted knowledge, they introduce more irrelevant information that hinders the model's generation process and degrades its performance. To address the issue, we design an adaptive prompting strategy which involves splitting the retrieved information into smaller chunks and sequentially prompting a LLM to answer the question using each chunk. Adjusting the chunk size allows a trade-off between incorporating relevant information and reducing irrelevant information. Experimental results on three open-domain question answering datasets demonstrate that the adaptive strategy matches the performance of standard prompting while using fewer tokens. Our analysis reveals that when encountering insufficient information, the LLM often generates incorrect answers instead of declining to respond, which constitutes a major source of error. This finding highlights the need for further research into enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively decline requests when faced with inadequate information.

Method: 从中间注意力层的token分布中提取token作为对抗扰动，在ArgQuality数据集上进行论证质量评估实验，使用LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B同时作为生成器和评估器

Result: 注意力层生成的对抗样本能显著降低评估性能，同时保持语义相似性；但某些层和token位置的替换会导致语法退化，限制了实际效果

Conclusion: 中间层表示作为对抗样本来源具有潜力，但当前存在语法退化等限制，为压力测试LLM评估管道提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in mechanistic interpretability suggest that intermediate attention layers encode token-level hypotheses that are iteratively refined toward the final output. In this work, we exploit this property to generate adversarial examples directly from attention-layer token distributions. Unlike prompt-based or gradient-based attacks, our approach leverages model-internal token predictions, producing perturbations that are both plausible and internally consistent with the model's own generation process. We evaluate whether tokens extracted from intermediate layers can serve as effective adversarial perturbations for downstream evaluation tasks. We conduct experiments on argument quality assessment using the ArgQuality dataset, with LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B serving as both the generator and evaluator. Our results show that attention-based adversarial examples lead to measurable drops in evaluation performance while remaining semantically similar to the original inputs. However, we also observe that substitutions drawn from certain layers and token positions can introduce grammatical degradation, limiting their practical effectiveness. Overall, our findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of using intermediate-layer representations as a principled source of adversarial examples for stress-testing LLM-based evaluation pipelines.

Conclusion: 领域特定训练具有潜在优越性能，最新LLM在少样本学习优化的数值推理能力得到增强。研究突出了在金融数值推理中结合领域知识和LLM的重要性。

Abstract: This research project addresses the errors of financial numerical reasoning Question Answering (QA) tasks due to the lack of domain knowledge in finance. Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), financial numerical questions remain challenging because they require specific domain knowledge in finance and complex multi-step numeric reasoning. We implement a multi-retriever Retrieval Augmented Generators (RAG) system to retrieve both external domain knowledge and internal question contexts, and utilize the latest LLM to tackle these tasks. Through comprehensive ablation experiments and error analysis, we find that domain-specific training with the SecBERT encoder significantly contributes to our best neural symbolic model surpassing the FinQA paper's top model, which serves as our baseline. This suggests the potential superior performance of domain-specific training. Furthermore, our best prompt-based LLM generator achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significant improvement (>7%), yet it is still below the human expert performance. This study highlights the trade-off between hallucinations loss and external knowledge gains in smaller models and few-shot examples. For larger models, the gains from external facts typically outweigh the hallucination loss. Finally, our findings confirm the enhanced numerical reasoning capabilities of the latest LLM, optimized for few-shot learning.

Motivation: 自动化评分常常混淆学生回答内容与教师评分倾向，需要建立一个分析框架来分离这两种信号，使评分判断变得可见和可审计。

Method: 使用ASSISTments数学回答数据，将教师历史建模为动态先验，从句子嵌入中提取文本表示，采用中心化和残差化来减轻提示和教师混杂因素，使用时序验证的线性模型量化每个信号的贡献。

Result: 教师先验对成绩预测影响很大；结合先验和内容嵌入时效果最好（AUC~0.815），仅内容模型虽高于随机但较弱（AUC~0.626）；调整评分者效应能锐化内容表示，保留更多信息维度。

Conclusion: 该框架将嵌入从简单特征转化为学习分析工具，使教师和研究者能够检查评分实践与学生推理证据是否一致，为反思提供实用管道。

Abstract: Open-ended responses are central to learning, yet automated scoring often conflates what students wrote with how teachers grade. We present an analytics-first framework that separates content signals from rater tendencies, making judgments visible and auditable via analytics. Using de-identified ASSISTments mathematics responses, we model teacher histories as dynamic priors and derive text representations from sentence embeddings, incorporating centering and residualization to mitigate prompt and teacher confounds. Temporally-validated linear models quantify the contributions of each signal, and a projection surfaces model disagreements for qualitative inspection. Results show that teacher priors heavily influence grade predictions; the strongest results arise when priors are combined with content embeddings (AUC~0.815), while content-only models remain above chance but substantially weaker (AUC~0.626). Adjusting for rater effects sharpens the residual content representation, retaining more informative embedding dimensions and revealing cases where semantic evidence supports understanding as opposed to surface-level differences in how students respond. The contribution presents a practical pipeline that transforms embeddings from mere features into learning analytics for reflection, enabling teachers and researchers to examine where grading practices align (or conflict) with evidence of student reasoning and learning.

Abstract: Multi-step retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely adopted strategy for enhancing large language models (LLMs) on tasks that demand global comprehension and intensive reasoning. Many RAG systems incorporate a working memory module to consolidate retrieved information. However, existing memory designs function primarily as passive storage that accumulates isolated facts for the purpose of condensing the lengthy inputs and generating new sub-queries through deduction. This static nature overlooks the crucial high-order correlations among primitive facts, the compositions of which can often provide stronger guidance for subsequent steps. Therefore, their representational strength and impact on multi-step reasoning and knowledge evolution are limited, resulting in fragmented reasoning and weak global sense-making capacity in extended contexts. We introduce HGMem, a hypergraph-based memory mechanism that extends the concept of memory beyond simple storage into a dynamic, expressive structure for complex reasoning and global understanding. In our approach, memory is represented as a hypergraph whose hyperedges correspond to distinct memory units, enabling the progressive formation of higher-order interactions within memory. This mechanism connects facts and thoughts around the focal problem, evolving into an integrated and situated knowledge structure that provides strong propositions for deeper reasoning in subsequent steps. We evaluate HGMem on several challenging datasets designed for global sense-making. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses show that our method consistently improves multi-step RAG and substantially outperforms strong baseline systems across diverse tasks.

Abstract: We introduce LongCat ZigZag Attention (LoZA), which is a sparse attention scheme designed to transform any existing full-attention models into sparse versions with rather limited compute budget. In long-context scenarios, LoZA can achieve significant speed-ups both for prefill-intensive (e.g., retrieval-augmented generation) and decode-intensive (e.g., tool-integrated reasoning) cases. Specifically, by applying LoZA to LongCat-Flash during mid-training, we serve LongCat-Flash-Exp as a long-context foundation model that can swiftly process up to 1 million tokens, enabling efficient long-term reasoning and long-horizon agentic capabilities.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和监督方法对新型错误缺乏鲁棒性，且依赖昂贵的标注数据。需要一种无需标签的鲁棒、可扩展的中文拼写纠错方法。

Method: CEC-Zero框架：1）从干净文本合成错误输入；2）通过语义相似度和候选一致性计算聚类共识奖励；3）使用PPO优化策略。提供无偏奖励和收敛的理论保证。

Result: 在9个基准测试中，比监督基线高出10-13个F1分数点，比强LLM微调方法高出5-8个F1分数点。

Conclusion: CEC-Zero建立了一种无需标签的范式，用于鲁棒、可扩展的中文拼写纠错，释放了LLM在噪声文本处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Large-scale Chinese spelling correction (CSC) remains critical for real-world text processing, yet existing LLMs and supervised methods lack robustness to novel errors and rely on costly annotations. We introduce CEC-Zero, a zero-supervision reinforcement learning framework that addresses this by enabling LLMs to correct their own mistakes. CEC-Zero synthesizes errorful inputs from clean text, computes cluster-consensus rewards via semantic similarity and candidate agreement, and optimizes the policy with PPO. It outperforms supervised baselines by 10--13 F$_1$ points and strong LLM fine-tunes by 5--8 points across 9 benchmarks, with theoretical guarantees of unbiased rewards and convergence. CEC-Zero establishes a label-free paradigm for robust, scalable CSC, unlocking LLM potential in noisy text pipelines.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工定义的概念来分析LLM推理过程，但难以捕捉完整的推理行为谱系，许多行为在token空间难以定义

Method: 将思维链轨迹分割为句子级"步骤"，在步骤级激活上训练稀疏自编码器，发现对应不同推理行为的解耦特征向量

Result: 发现了解释性行为如反思和回溯，这些行为在解码器列空间中占据可分离区域；通过干预SAE向量可控制推理行为；还能发现超越人工监督的新行为

Conclusion: 无监督潜在发现方法在解释和控制LLM推理方面具有巨大潜力，为理解模型内部机制提供了新途径

Abstract: Despite the growing reasoning capabilities of recent large language models (LLMs), their internal mechanisms during the reasoning process remain underexplored. Prior approaches often rely on human-defined concepts (e.g., overthinking, reflection) at the word level to analyze reasoning in a supervised manner. However, such methods are limited, as it is infeasible to capture the full spectrum of potential reasoning behaviors, many of which are difficult to define in token space. In this work, we propose an unsupervised framework (namely, RISE: Reasoning behavior Interpretability via Sparse auto-Encoder) for discovering reasoning vectors, which we define as directions in the activation space that encode distinct reasoning behaviors. By segmenting chain-of-thought traces into sentence-level 'steps' and training sparse auto-encoders (SAEs) on step-level activations, we uncover disentangled features corresponding to interpretable behaviors such as reflection and backtracking. Visualization and clustering analyses show that these behaviors occupy separable regions in the decoder column space. Moreover, targeted interventions on SAE-derived vectors can controllably amplify or suppress specific reasoning behaviors, altering inference trajectories without retraining. Beyond behavior-specific disentanglement, SAEs capture structural properties such as response length, revealing clusters of long versus short reasoning traces. More interestingly, SAEs enable the discovery of novel behaviors beyond human supervision. We demonstrate the ability to control response confidence by identifying confidence-related vectors in the SAE decoder space. These findings underscore the potential of unsupervised latent discovery for both interpreting and controllably steering reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Distinguishing fake or untrue news from satire or humor poses a unique challenge due to their overlapping linguistic features and divergent intent. This study develops WISE (Web Information Satire and Fakeness Evaluation) framework which benchmarks eight lightweight transformer models alongside two baseline models on a balanced dataset of 20,000 samples from Fakeddit, annotated as either fake news or satire. Using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, we evaluate models across comprehensive metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, MCC, Brier score, and Expected Calibration Error. Our evaluation reveals that MiniLM, a lightweight model, achieves the highest accuracy (87.58%) among all models, while RoBERTa-base achieves the highest ROC-AUC (95.42%) and strong accuracy (87.36%). DistilBERT offers an excellent efficiency-accuracy trade-off with 86.28\% accuracy and 93.90\% ROC-AUC. Statistical tests confirm significant performance differences between models, with paired t-tests and McNemar tests providing rigorous comparisons. Our findings highlight that lightweight models can match or exceed baseline performance, offering actionable insights for deploying misinformation detection systems in real-world, resource-constrained settings.

Conclusion: iCLP框架成功让LLM在潜在空间进行隐式规划，在语言空间进行推理，解决了显式文本计划的局限性，实现了更高效可靠的推理

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), when guided by explicit textual plans, can perform reliable step-by-step reasoning during problem-solving. However, generating accurate and effective textual plans remains challenging due to LLM hallucinations and the high diversity of task-specific questions. To address this, we draw inspiration from human Implicit Cognition (IC), the subconscious process by which decisions are guided by compact, generalized patterns learned from past experiences without requiring explicit verbalization. We propose iCLP, a novel framework that enables LLMs to adaptively generate latent plans (LPs), which are compact encodings of effective reasoning instructions. iCLP first distills explicit plans from existing step-by-step reasoning trajectories. It then learns discrete representations of these plans via a vector-quantized autoencoder coupled with a codebook. Finally, by fine-tuning LLMs on paired latent plans and corresponding reasoning steps, the models learn to perform implicit planning during reasoning. Experimental results on mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks demonstrate that, with iCLP, LLMs can plan in latent space while reasoning in language space. This approach yields significant improvements in both accuracy and efficiency and, crucially, demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization while preserving the interpretability of chain-of-thought reasoning.

Motivation: LLM在医疗、法律、金融等决策关键领域应用日益增多，但其可靠性仍不确定。现有评估方法碎片化，只关注孤立方面，无法全面评估模型可靠性。

Method: 引入Composite Reliability Score (CRS)统一框架，整合校准、鲁棒性和不确定性量化三个维度。在10个开源LLM和5个QA数据集上进行实验，评估基线性能、扰动影响和校准方法。

Result: CRS提供稳定的模型排名，揭示单一指标遗漏的隐藏故障模式，表明最可靠的系统需要平衡准确性、鲁棒性和校准的不确定性。

Conclusion: CRS是一个有效的统一评估框架，能够全面评估LLM在决策关键应用中的可靠性，帮助识别最可靠的系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma are increasingly used in decision-critical domains such as healthcare, law, and finance, yet their reliability remains uncertain. They often make overconfident errors, degrade under input shifts, and lack clear uncertainty estimates. Existing evaluations are fragmented, addressing only isolated aspects. We introduce the Composite Reliability Score (CRS), a unified framework that integrates calibration, robustness, and uncertainty quantification into a single interpretable metric. Through experiments on ten leading open-source LLMs across five QA datasets, we assess performance under baselines, perturbations, and calibration methods. CRS delivers stable model rankings, uncovers hidden failure modes missed by single metrics, and highlights that the most dependable systems balance accuracy, robustness, and calibrated uncertainty.

Conclusion: 该方法为MDLM提供了高效的推理时控制机制，能够有效调节文本生成属性，且计算成本低

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) generate text through an iterative denoising process. They have recently gained attention due to mask-parallel decoding and competitive performance with autoregressive large language models. However, effective mechanisms for inference-time control and steering in MDLMs remain largely unexplored. We present an activation-steering framework for MDLMs that computes layer-wise steering vectors from a single forward pass using contrastive examples, without simulating the denoising trajectory. These directions are applied at every reverse-diffusion step, yielding an efficient inference-time control mechanism. Experiments on LLaDA-8B-Instruct demonstrate reliable modulation of high-level attributes, with ablations examining the effects of steering across transformer sub-modules and token scope (prompt vs.\ response).

Abstract: World Models serve as tools for understanding the current state of the world and predicting its future dynamics, with broad application potential across numerous fields. As a key component of world knowledge, emotion significantly influences human decision-making. While existing Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown preliminary capability in capturing world knowledge, they primarily focus on modeling physical-world regularities and lack systematic exploration of emotional factors. In this paper, we first demonstrate the importance of emotion in understanding the world by showing that removing emotionally relevant information degrades reasoning performance. Inspired by theory of mind, we further propose a Large Emotional World Model (LEWM). Specifically, we construct the Emotion-Why-How (EWH) dataset, which integrates emotion into causal relationships and enables reasoning about why actions occur and how emotions drive future world states. Based on this dataset, LEWM explicitly models emotional states alongside visual observations and actions, allowing the world model to predict both future states and emotional transitions. Experimental results show that LEWM more accurately predicts emotion-driven social behaviors while maintaining comparable performance to general world models on basic tasks.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型在临床诊断中存在三个关键局限：1）由于缺乏已验证知识的支撑，产生幻觉性医疗内容；2）提出冗余或低效问题而非有助于诊断进展的区分性问题；3）在多轮对话中失去连贯性，导致矛盾或不一致的结论。需要模拟真实临床场景中迭代、诊断假设驱动的推理过程。

Method: 提出MedKGI诊断框架：1）整合医学知识图谱，将推理约束在已验证的医学本体中；2）基于信息增益选择问题，最大化诊断效率；3）采用OSCE格式结构化状态，在多轮对话中保持一致的证据追踪。

Conclusion: MedKGI通过将临床实践原则融入LLM推理过程，有效解决了当前LLM在临床诊断中的关键限制，实现了更准确、高效的诊断对话系统。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant promise in clinical diagnosis. However, current models struggle to emulate the iterative, diagnostic hypothesis-driven reasoning of real clinical scenarios. Specifically, current LLMs suffer from three critical limitations: (1) generating hallucinated medical content due to weak grounding in verified knowledge, (2) asking redundant or inefficient questions rather than discriminative ones that hinder diagnostic progress, and (3) losing coherence over multi-turn dialogues, leading to contradictory or inconsistent conclusions. To address these challenges, we propose MedKGI, a diagnostic framework grounded in clinical practices. MedKGI integrates a medical knowledge graph (KG) to constrain reasoning to validated medical ontologies, selects questions based on information gain to maximize diagnostic efficiency, and adopts an OSCE-format structured state to maintain consistent evidence tracking across turns. Experiments on clinical benchmarks show that MedKGI outperforms strong LLM baselines in both diagnostic accuracy and inquiry efficiency, improving dialogue efficiency by 30% on average while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy.

Result: Pat-SPECTER模型在预测专利-论文引用方面表现最佳。验证了假设：美国专利因诚信义务要求，引用的论文与专利内容语义相似度低于其他主要司法管辖区。

Conclusion: Pat-SPECTER是有效的专利-文献相似度分析工具，揭示了不同司法管辖区引用模式的差异，模型已开源供学术和实践使用。

Abstract: We develop a language similarity model suitable for working with patents and scientific publications at the same time. In a horse race-style evaluation, we subject eight language (similarity) models to predict credible Patent-Paper Citations. We find that our Pat-SPECTER model performs best, which is the SPECTER2 model fine-tuned on patents. In two real-world scenarios (separating patent-paper-pairs and predicting patent-paper-pairs) we demonstrate the capabilities of the Pat-SPECTER. We finally test the hypothesis that US patents cite papers that are semantically less similar than in other large jurisdictions, which we posit is because of the duty of candor. The model is open for the academic community and practitioners alike.

### [140] [Joint Selection for Large-Scale Pre-Training Data via Policy Gradient-based Mask Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24265)
*Ziqing Fan,Yuqiao Xian,Yan Sun,Li Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DATAMASK是一个用于大规模预训练数据选择的高效联合学习框架，能同时优化质量和多样性指标，从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选出约10%的子集，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模预训练数据选择方法存在两个问题：基于质量指标的选择在长期预训练中收益递减严重，而基于多样性指标的选择会移除太多高质量样本。这两种方法都限制了预训练LLM的能力，且由于计算成本高，很少在万亿级token数据集上联合考虑多种指标。

Method: DATAMASK将数据选择过程视为掩码学习问题，采用基于策略梯度的优化方法：迭代采样数据掩码，基于预定义目标计算策略梯度，更新掩码采样逻辑。通过策略梯度优化和各种加速增强，相比贪心算法减少了98.9%的选择时间。

Result: 从15万亿token的FineWeb数据集中选出约10%的子集（FineWeb-Mask）。在12个多样化任务上评估，1.5B密集模型性能提升3.2%，7B MoE模型提升1.9%。选择时间相比贪心算法减少98.9%。

Conclusion: DATAMASK是一个高效的大规模预训练数据选择框架，能同时优化质量和多样性指标，在万亿级token数据集上实现快速选择，显著提升模型性能，解决了传统方法在长期预训练中的局限性。

Abstract: A fine-grained data recipe is crucial for pre-training large language models, as it can significantly enhance training efficiency and model performance. One important ingredient in the recipe is to select samples based on scores produced by defined rules, LLM judgment, or statistical information in embeddings, which can be roughly categorized into quality and diversity metrics. Due to the high computational cost when applied to trillion-scale token pre-training datasets such as FineWeb and DCLM, these two or more types of metrics are rarely considered jointly in a single selection process. However, in our empirical study, selecting samples based on quality metrics exhibit severe diminishing returns during long-term pre-training, while selecting on diversity metrics removes too many valuable high-quality samples, both of which limit pre-trained LLMs' capabilities. Therefore, we introduce DATAMASK, a novel and efficient joint learning framework designed for large-scale pre-training data selection that can simultaneously optimize multiple types of metrics in a unified process, with this study focusing specifically on quality and diversity metrics. DATAMASK approaches the selection process as a mask learning problem, involving iterative sampling of data masks, computation of policy gradients based on predefined objectives with sampled masks, and updating of mask sampling logits. Through policy gradient-based optimization and various acceleration enhancements, it significantly reduces selection time by 98.9% compared to greedy algorithm, enabling our study to explore joint learning within trillion-scale tokens. With DATAMASK, we select a subset of about 10% from the 15 trillion-token FineWeb dataset, termed FineWeb-Mask. Evaluated across 12 diverse tasks, we achieves significant improvements of 3.2% on a 1.5B dense model and 1.9% on a 7B MoE model.

*Jonathan Schmoll,Adam Jatowt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文针对欧盟分类法合规的自动化需求，创建了首个公开基准数据集，并系统评估了LLM在定性和定量合规任务上的表现，发现LLM在定性任务上表现尚可，但在定量任务上完全失败，结论是LLM目前只能作为辅助工具而非完全自动化解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧盟分类法合规流程需要大量人工和资源，而LLM提供了自动化可能，但缺乏公开基准数据集阻碍了相关研究。为解决这一问题，作者创建了首个结构化数据集来评估LLM在合规工作流中的表现。

Method: 从190份公司报告中提取数据，构建包含真实经济活动信息和定量关键绩效指标的结构化数据集。使用该数据集对LLM进行系统评估，包括定性经济活动识别和定量KPI预测任务，并测试多步智能体框架对性能的影响。

Result: LLM在定性经济活动识别任务上表现中等，多步智能体框架能适度提升精度；但在零样本设置的定量KPI预测任务上完全失败。还发现简洁的元数据往往比完整非结构化报告表现更好，模型置信度分数校准不佳。

Conclusion: LLM尚未准备好实现完全自动化，但可以作为人类专家的强大辅助工具。创建的数据集为未来研究提供了公开基准。

Abstract: The manual, resource-intensive process of complying with the EU Taxonomy presents a significant challenge for companies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, research is hindered by a lack of public benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, structured dataset from 190 corporate reports, containing ground-truth economic activities and quantitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). We use this dataset to conduct the first systematic evaluation of LLMs on the core compliance workflow. Our results reveal a clear performance gap between qualitative and quantitative tasks. LLMs show moderate success in the qualitative task of identifying economic activities, with a multi-step agentic framework modestly enhancing precision. Conversely, the models comprehensively fail at the quantitative task of predicting financial KPIs in a zero-shot setting. We also discover a paradox, where concise metadata often yields superior performance to full, unstructured reports, and find that model confidence scores are poorly calibrated. We conclude that while LLMs are not ready for full automation, they can serve as powerful assistive tools for human experts. Our dataset provides a public benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: FIGR通过强化学习将视觉思维整合到多轮推理中，构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设，在复杂数学推理任务上显著优于纯文本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂推理问题常涉及隐含的空间、几何和结构关系，这些关系在文本中未明确编码。纯文本推理难以捕捉复杂场景中的全局结构约束，需要新的方法来增强推理的稳定性和可靠性。

Method: FIGR通过端到端强化学习将主动视觉思维整合到多轮推理中，在问题解决过程中构建视觉表示来外化中间结构假设。系统自适应地调节何时以及如何调用视觉推理，从而更好地处理全局结构特性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试中，FIGR显著优于强大的纯文本思维链基线模型。具体来说，FIGR在AIME 2025上比基础模型提升了13.12%，在BeyondAIME上提升了11.00%。

Conclusion: 图形引导的多模态推理能有效增强复杂推理的稳定性和可靠性，视觉表示对于捕捉文本难以表达的全局结构约束至关重要。

Abstract: Complex reasoning problems often involve implicit spatial, geometric, and structural relationships that are not explicitly encoded in text. While recent reasoning models have achieved strong performance across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to represent global structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates active visual thinking into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. FIGR externalizes intermediate structural hypotheses by constructing visual representations during problem solving. By adaptively regulating when and how visual reasoning should be invoked, FIGR enables more stable and coherent reasoning over global structural properties that are difficult to capture from text alone. Experiments on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines. In particular, FIGR improves the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME, highlighting the effectiveness of figure-guided multimodal reasoning in enhancing the stability and reliability of complex reasoning.

TL;DR: QianfanHuijin是一个金融领域大语言模型，采用多阶段训练范式，包括持续预训练和细粒度后训练，在金融基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域需要不仅具备领域知识，还要有强大金融推理和代理能力的模型。现有模型主要关注知识增强，无法满足日益复杂的金融服务需求。

Method: 提出通用的多阶段训练范式：1) 金融语料持续预训练巩固知识基础；2) 细粒度后训练：金融SFT → 金融推理RL → 金融代理RL → 通用RL（对齐真实业务场景）。

Result: QianfanHuijin在各种权威金融基准测试中表现优异。消融研究证实针对性的推理RL和代理RL阶段显著提升了相应能力。

Conclusion: 这种细粒度、渐进式的后训练方法有望成为各种工业增强型LLM的主流范式，验证了研究动机的有效性。

Abstract: Domain-specific enhancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) within the financial context has long been a focal point of industrial application. While previous models such as BloombergGPT and Baichuan-Finance primarily focused on knowledge enhancement, the deepening complexity of financial services has driven a growing demand for models that possess not only domain knowledge but also robust financial reasoning and agentic capabilities. In this paper, we present QianfanHuijin, a financial domain LLM, and propose a generalizable multi-stage training paradigm for industrial model enhancement.
  Our approach begins with Continual Pre-training (CPT) on financial corpora to consolidate the knowledge base. This is followed by a fine-grained Post-training pipeline designed with increasing specificity: starting with Financial SFT, progressing to Finance Reasoning RL and Finance Agentic RL, and culminating in General RL aligned with real-world business scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate that QianfanHuijin achieves superior performance across various authoritative financial benchmarks. Furthermore, ablation studies confirm that the targeted Reasoning RL and Agentic RL stages yield significant gains in their respective capabilities. These findings validate our motivation and suggest that this fine-grained, progressive post-training methodology is poised to become a mainstream paradigm for various industrial-enhanced LLMs.

### [144] [World model inspired sarcasm reasoning with large language model agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24329)
*Keito Inoshita,Shinnosuke Mizuno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出WM-SAR方法，将讽刺理解重新定义为世界模型启发的推理过程，通过分解字面意义、上下文、规范期望和意图为专门的LLM代理，实现高性能且可解释的讽刺检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有讽刺理解方法大多依赖单一模型的黑盒预测，难以结构化解释讽刺背后的认知因素。讽刺通常表现为语义评估与规范期望或意图之间的不匹配，但明确分解和建模这些组件的框架仍然有限。

Method: 提出World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR)，将字面意义、上下文、规范期望和意图分解为专门的LLM代理。通过量化字面评估与规范期望之间的不一致性得分，结合意图得分，使用轻量级逻辑回归模型集成这些信号来推断最终讽刺概率。

Result: 在代表性讽刺检测基准测试中，WM-SAR始终优于现有的深度学习和LLM方法。消融研究和案例分析进一步表明，整合语义不一致性和意图推理对于有效的讽刺检测至关重要，实现了强大的性能和高度可解释性。

Conclusion: WM-SAR通过世界模型启发的推理过程，将讽刺理解分解为可解释的认知组件，既利用了LLM的推理能力，又保持了可解释的数值决策结构，在性能和可解释性方面都取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Sarcasm understanding is a challenging problem in natural language processing, as it requires capturing the discrepancy between the surface meaning of an utterance and the speaker's intentions as well as the surrounding social context. Although recent advances in deep learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially improved performance, most existing approaches still rely on black-box predictions of a single model, making it difficult to structurally explain the cognitive factors underlying sarcasm. Moreover, while sarcasm often emerges as a mismatch between semantic evaluation and normative expectations or intentions, frameworks that explicitly decompose and model these components remain limited. In this work, we reformulate sarcasm understanding as a world model inspired reasoning process and propose World Model inspired SArcasm Reasoning (WM-SAR), which decomposes literal meaning, context, normative expectation, and intention into specialized LLM-based agents. The discrepancy between literal evaluation and normative expectation is explicitly quantified as a deterministic inconsistency score, and together with an intention score, these signals are integrated by a lightweight Logistic Regression model to infer the final sarcasm probability. This design leverages the reasoning capability of LLMs while maintaining an interpretable numerical decision structure. Experiments on representative sarcasm detection benchmarks show that WM-SAR consistently outperforms existing deep learning and LLM-based methods. Ablation studies and case analyses further demonstrate that integrating semantic inconsistency and intention reasoning is essential for effective sarcasm detection, achieving both strong performance and high interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，通过随机掩码文档段落并使用NLI对比目标来增强长文档表示，在法医和生物医学文本上实现精度和效率的双重提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在长文档表示方面存在困难，稀疏注意力机制资源消耗大且难以捕获完整文档上下文，分层Transformer模型效率较好但缺乏对文档不同部分关系的明确解释。人类通过略读重要部分来理解整体信息的策略启发了本研究。

Method: 提出自监督对比学习框架：随机掩码文档段落，使用基于自然语言推理(NLI)的对比目标，将被掩码段落与相关部分对齐，同时与不相关部分保持距离，模拟人类信息合成过程。

Result: 在法医和生物医学文本上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和计算效率方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类略读策略的自监督对比学习框架，能够生成更丰富且计算效率更高的长文档表示，为法律和医学等领域的长文档处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although transformer-based models have shown strong performance in word- and sentence-level tasks, effectively representing long documents, especially in fields like law and medicine, remains difficult. Sparse attention mechanisms can handle longer inputs, but are resource-intensive and often fail to capture full-document context. Hierarchical transformer models offer better efficiency but do not clearly explain how they relate different sections of a document. In contrast, humans often skim texts, focusing on important sections to understand the overall message. Drawing from this human strategy, we introduce a new self-supervised contrastive learning framework that enhances long document representation. Our method randomly masks a section of the document and uses a natural language inference (NLI)-based contrastive objective to align it with relevant parts while distancing it from unrelated ones. This mimics how humans synthesize information, resulting in representations that are both richer and more computationally efficient. Experiments on legal and biomedical texts confirm significant gains in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了多种低资源语言文本摘要方法，包括零样本LLM提示、微调mT5模型、数据增强、多语言迁移和翻译管道方法，发现微调mT5在多数指标上优于其他方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动文本摘要在英语等高资源语言中已取得高性能，但对低资源语言的摘要研究相对较少，需要探索适合低资源语言的有效摘要方法

Method: 比较了多种方法：1）不同规模LLM的零样本提示；2）微调mT5模型（有/无三种数据增强方法）；3）多语言迁移；4）LLM翻译管道方法（源语言→英语→摘要→翻译回源语言）。使用五种不同指标进行评估

Result: 发现：1）相似参数规模的LLM性能存在差异；2）多语言微调mT5基线在大多数指标上优于包括零样本LLM在内的大多数方法；3）LLM作为评估器在低资源语言上可能不太可靠

Conclusion: 对于低资源语言文本摘要，微调多语言模型（如mT5）是有效的方法，而依赖LLM零样本性能或LLM作为评估器在低资源语言场景下存在局限性

Abstract: Automatic text summarization has achieved high performance in high-resourced languages like English, but comparatively less attention has been given to summarization in less-resourced languages. This work compares a variety of different approaches to summarization from zero-shot prompting of LLMs large and small to fine-tuning smaller models like mT5 with and without three data augmentation approaches and multilingual transfer. We also explore an LLM translation pipeline approach, translating from the source language to English, summarizing and translating back. Evaluating with five different metrics, we find that there is variation across LLMs in their performance across similar parameter sizes, that our multilingual fine-tuned mT5 baseline outperforms most other approaches including zero-shot LLM performance for most metrics, and that LLM as judge may be less reliable on less-resourced languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学摘要常被用作研究内容代理，但许多摘要包含版权声明、章节标题、作者注释、注册信息、文献计量元数据等无关内容，这些会扭曲下游分析（特别是文档相似性和文本嵌入）

Method: 开发了一个开源、易于集成的语言模型，专门用于自动识别和清理英文科学摘要中的无关信息

Result: 模型既保守又精确，改变了清理后摘要的相似性排名，并提高了标准长度嵌入的信息内容

Conclusion: 该模型能有效清理科学摘要中的无关信息，改善文本分析质量，为下游任务提供更干净的文本数据

Abstract: Scientific abstracts are often used as proxies for the content and thematic focus of research publications. However, a significant share of published abstracts contains extraneous information-such as publisher copyright statements, section headings, author notes, registrations, and bibliometric or bibliographic metadata-that can distort downstream analyses, particularly those involving document similarity or textual embeddings. We introduce an open-source, easy-to-integrate language model designed to clean English-language scientific abstracts by automatically identifying and removing such clutter. We demonstrate that our model is both conservative and precise, alters similarity rankings of cleaned abstracts and improves information content of standard-length embeddings.

Motivation: 传统雅思备考方法缺乏针对雅思写作评分标准的个性化反馈，需要开发能够提供针对性指导的智能平台

Method: 采用设计研究(DBR)方法，从基于规则的评分系统迭代到基于DistilBERT转换器模型（带回归头）的自动化评分系统，并实现自适应反馈功能

Result: DistilBERT模型显著提升评分准确性（MAE=0.66，R²为正），自适应反馈使平均分数提高0.060个等级（p=0.011，效应量d=0.504）

Conclusion: 自动化反馈最适合作为人工教学的补充，保守的表面修正比激进的结枃干预更可靠；未来需解决高分作文评估问题，并进行长期研究和考官验证

Abstract: This paper presents the design, development, and evaluation of a proposed revision platform assisting candidates for the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) writing exam. Traditional IELTS preparation methods lack personalised feedback, catered to the IELTS writing rubric. To address these shortcomings, the platform features an attractive user interface (UI), an Automated Essay Scoring system (AES), and targeted feedback tailored to candidates and the IELTS writing rubric. The platform architecture separates conversational guidance from a dedicated writing interface to reduce cognitive load and simulate exam conditions. Through iterative, Design-Based Research (DBR) cycles, the study progressed from rule-based to transformer-based with a regression head scoring, mounted with adaptive feedback.
  Early cycles (2-3) revealed fundamental limitations of rule-based approaches: mid-band compression, low accuracy, and negative $R^2$ values. DBR Cycle 4 implemented a DistilBERT transformer model with a regression head, yielding substantial improvements with MAE of 0.66 and positive $R^2$. This enabled Cycle 5's adaptive feedback implementation, which demonstrated statistically significant score improvements (mean +0.060 bands, p = 0.011, Cohen's d = 0.504), though effectiveness varied by revision strategy. Findings suggest automated feedback functions are most suited as a supplement to human instruction, with conservative surface-level corrections proving more reliable than aggressive structural interventions for IELTS preparation contexts. Challenges remain in assessing higher-band essays, and future work should incorporate longitudinal studies with real IELTS candidates and validation from official examiners.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动语音转录通常输出无结构的单词流，降低了可读性和再利用性。当前语音处理领域缺乏段落分割这一关键后处理步骤，且文本分割领域也缺乏稳健、自然的基准数据集。

Method: 1）创建两个基准数据集：TEDPara（人工标注的TED演讲）和YTSegPara（合成标注的YouTube视频）；2）提出约束解码方法，让大语言模型在保持原始转录文本的同时插入段落分隔符；3）开发紧凑模型MiniSeg，并通过分层扩展实现章节和段落联合预测。

Result: 建立了首个语音段落分割基准，提出的约束解码方法实现了忠实、句子对齐的评估，MiniSeg模型在准确率上达到最先进水平，且计算成本低，分层扩展后能有效联合预测章节和段落。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了语音处理和文本分割交叉领域的空白，将段落分割确立为语音处理中标准化、实用的任务，为语音转录的结构化后处理提供了完整解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic speech transcripts are often delivered as unstructured word streams that impede readability and repurposing. We recast paragraph segmentation as the missing structuring step and fill three gaps at the intersection of speech processing and text segmentation. First, we establish TEDPara (human-annotated TED talks) and YTSegPara (YouTube videos with synthetic labels) as the first benchmarks for the paragraph segmentation task. The benchmarks focus on the underexplored speech domain, where paragraph segmentation has traditionally not been part of post-processing, while also contributing to the wider text segmentation field, which still lacks robust and naturalistic benchmarks. Second, we propose a constrained-decoding formulation that lets large language models insert paragraph breaks while preserving the original transcript, enabling faithful, sentence-aligned evaluation. Third, we show that a compact model (MiniSeg) attains state-of-the-art accuracy and, when extended hierarchically, jointly predicts chapters and paragraphs with minimal computational cost. Together, our resources and methods establish paragraph segmentation as a standardized, practical task in speech processing.

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大语言模型的安全对齐存在语言和时态框架的复杂干扰，而非简单的低资源语言安全退化，揭示了安全性的情境依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型融入全球关键基础设施，安全对齐从英语零样本迁移到其他语言的假设存在危险盲点，需要系统审计模型在低资源语言和特定文化威胁场景下的安全性。

Method: 使用基于西非威胁场景的HausaSafety对抗数据集，对GPT-5.1、Gemini 3 Pro和Claude 4.5 Opus三个先进模型进行系统审计，采用2×4因子设计（语言×时态框架）进行1440次评估。

Result: 发现复杂干扰机制而非简单的安全退化：Claude 4.5 Opus在豪萨语中更安全（45.0% vs 英语36.7%），但存在灾难性的时态推理失败；过去时框架绕过防御（15.6%安全），未来时触发过度保守拒绝（57.2%安全），最安全与最脆弱配置相差9.2倍。

Conclusion: 当前模型依赖表面启发式而非稳健语义理解，形成安全盲点，使全球南方用户暴露于本地化危害；需要向不变对齐范式转变，确保跨语言和时态变化的安全性稳定性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) integrate into critical global infrastructure, the assumption that safety alignment transfers zero-shot from English to other languages remains a dangerous blind spot. This study presents a systematic audit of three state of the art models (GPT-5.1, Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude 4.5 Opus) using HausaSafety, a novel adversarial dataset grounded in West African threat scenarios (e.g., Yahoo-Yahoo fraud, Dane gun manufacturing). Employing a 2 x 4 factorial design across 1,440 evaluations, we tested the non-linear interaction between language (English vs. Hausa) and temporal framing. Our results challenge the prevailing multilingual safety gap narrative. Instead of a simple degradation in low-resource settings, we identified a mechanism of Complex Interference where safety is determined by the intersection of variables. While models exhibited a Reverse Linguistic with Claude 4.5 Opus proving significantly safer in Hausa (45.0%) than in English (36.7%) due to uncertainty-driven refusal they suffered catastrophic failures in temporal reasoning. We report a profound Temporal Asymmetry, where past-tense framing bypassed defenses (15.6% safe) while future-tense scenarios triggered hyper-conservative refusals (57.2% safe). The magnitude of this volatility is illustrated by a 9.2x disparity between the safest and most vulnerable configurations, proving that safety is not a fixed property but a context-dependent state. We conclude that current models rely on superficial heuristics rather than robust semantic understanding, creating Safety Pockets that leave Global South users exposed to localized harms. We propose Invariant Alignment as a necessary paradigm shift to ensure safety stability across linguistic and temporal shifts.

TL;DR: HaluNet是一个轻量级可训练的神经网络框架，通过集成多粒度令牌级不确定性（结合语义嵌入与概率置信度和分布不确定性）来检测LLM幻觉，实现高效的单次检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在问答中经常产生幻觉（事实错误或捏造内容），现有方法通常只关注单一类型的不确定性，忽略了不同来源（特别是令牌级概率不确定性和内部语义表示不确定性）之间的互补性。

Method: 提出HaluNet框架，采用多分支架构自适应地融合模型已知信息与其输出中表达的不确定性，结合语义嵌入与概率置信度和分布不确定性，实现高效的单次幻觉检测。

Result: 在SQuAD、TriviaQA和Natural Questions上的实验表明，HaluNet在有无上下文访问的情况下都表现出强大的检测性能和良好的计算效率。

Conclusion: HaluNet展示了在基于LLM的问答系统中进行实时幻觉检测的潜力，通过有效整合多源不确定性信号来提高检测准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at question answering (QA) but often generate hallucinations, including factual errors or fabricated content. Detecting hallucinations from internal uncertainty signals is attractive due to its scalability and independence from external resources. Existing methods often aim to accurately capture a single type of uncertainty while overlooking the complementarity among different sources, particularly between token-level probability uncertainty and the uncertainty conveyed by internal semantic representations, which provide complementary views on model reliability. We present \textbf{HaluNet}, a lightweight and trainable neural framework that integrates multi granular token level uncertainties by combining semantic embeddings with probabilistic confidence and distributional uncertainty. Its multi branch architecture adaptively fuses what the model knows with the uncertainty expressed in its outputs, enabling efficient one pass hallucination detection. Experiments on SQuAD, TriviaQA, and Natural Questions show that HaluNet delivers strong detection performance and favorable computational efficiency, with or without access to context, highlighting its potential for real time hallucination detection in LLM based QA systems.

Abstract: We introduce the Korean Canonical Legal Benchmark (KCL), a benchmark designed to assess language models' legal reasoning capabilities independently of domain-specific knowledge.

TL;DR: CREST：一种无需训练的方法，通过干预特定注意力头来引导LLM推理，提高准确性同时减少计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型依赖长思维链推理，但这种方法效率低下，存在延迟高、推理不稳定（浅层思考与过度思考交替）的问题

Method: CREST包含两个组件：1）离线校准步骤识别认知头并推导头特定引导向量；2）推理时旋转隐藏表示以抑制这些向量分量

Result: 在多样化推理基准和模型上，CREST将准确性提升高达17.5%，同时减少37.6%的token使用

Conclusion: CREST提供了一种简单有效的途径，实现更快、更可靠的LLM推理，通过抑制非生产性推理行为来优化推理轨迹

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often rely on long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to solve complex tasks. While effective, these trajectories are frequently inefficient, leading to high latency from excessive token generation, or unstable reasoning that alternates between underthinking (shallow, inconsistent steps) and overthinking (repetitive, verbose reasoning). In this work, we study the structure of reasoning trajectories and uncover specialized attention heads that correlate with distinct cognitive behaviors such as verification and backtracking. By lightly intervening on these heads at inference time, we can steer the model away from inefficient modes. Building on this insight, we propose CREST, a training-free method for Cognitive REasoning Steering at Test-time. CREST has two components: (1) an offline calibration step that identifies cognitive heads and derives head-specific steering vectors, and (2) an inference-time procedure that rotates hidden representations to suppress components along those vectors. CREST adaptively suppresses unproductive reasoning behaviors, yielding both higher accuracy and lower computational cost. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks and models, CREST improves accuracy by up to 17.5% while reducing token usage by 37.6%, offering a simple and effective pathway to faster, more reliable LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Youtu-LLM是一个1.96B参数的轻量级语言模型，通过从头预训练而非蒸馏，在长上下文支持、多阶段课程学习和代理能力训练方面取得突破，在sub-2B模型中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有小模型通常依赖蒸馏技术，缺乏内在的推理和规划能力。作者希望开发一个轻量级但具备原生代理智能的模型，能够在有限计算资源下处理长视野代理任务。

Method: 1) 采用密集多潜在注意力架构和STEM导向词汇表，支持128k上下文窗口；2) 设计"常识-STEM-代理"多阶段课程学习，使用约11T token数据进行渐进式训练；3) 针对代理能力进行可扩展的中期训练，通过多样化数据构建方案合成数学、编程和工具使用轨迹。

Result: Youtu-LLM在sub-2B模型中达到新的SOTA水平。在通用基准测试中与更大模型竞争，在代理特定任务上显著超越现有SOTA基线，证明轻量级模型可以具备强大的内在代理能力。

Conclusion: 通过系统化的架构设计、课程学习和代理训练，轻量级语言模型可以具备强大的推理和规划能力，为资源受限环境下的智能代理应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We introduce Youtu-LLM, a lightweight yet powerful language model that harmonizes high computational efficiency with native agentic intelligence. Unlike typical small models that rely on distillation, Youtu-LLM (1.96B) is pre-trained from scratch to systematically cultivate reasoning and planning capabilities. The key technical advancements are as follows: (1) Compact Architecture with Long-Context Support: Built on a dense Multi-Latent Attention (MLA) architecture with a novel STEM-oriented vocabulary, Youtu-LLM supports a 128k context window. This design enables robust long-context reasoning and state tracking within a minimal memory footprint, making it ideal for long-horizon agent and reasoning tasks. (2) Principled "Commonsense-STEM-Agent" Curriculum: We curated a massive corpus of approximately 11T tokens and implemented a multi-stage training strategy. By progressively shifting the pre-training data distribution from general commonsense to complex STEM and agentic tasks, we ensure the model acquires deep cognitive abilities rather than superficial alignment. (3) Scalable Agentic Mid-training: Specifically for the agentic mid-training, we employ diverse data construction schemes to synthesize rich and varied trajectories across math, coding, and tool-use domains. This high-quality data enables the model to internalize planning and reflection behaviors effectively. Extensive evaluations show that Youtu-LLM sets a new state-of-the-art for sub-2B LLMs. On general benchmarks, it achieves competitive performance against larger models, while on agent-specific tasks, it significantly surpasses existing SOTA baselines, demonstrating that lightweight models can possess strong intrinsic agentic capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在预测自身任务成功率方面存在过度自信问题，虽然具备一定判别能力，但随着任务进展过度自信加剧，部分模型能从失败经验中学习改进决策，但整体缺乏对自身能力的准确认知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型是否能够准确预测自己在特定任务上的成功率，以及这种预测能力是否会随着多步骤任务的进展而改善。同时探索LLMs能否从上下文经验中学习，在失败成本高昂的场景中做出更好的任务选择决策。

Method: 测试多种LLMs预测任务成功率的能力，评估其在多步骤任务中的预测变化，研究模型从失败经验中学习的能力，分析决策理性与成功率估计的关系。

Result: 所有测试的LLMs都表现出过度自信，但大多数具备优于随机的判别能力。较新较大的模型不一定有更好的判别能力，Claude模型显示这种趋势。在多步骤任务中，多个前沿LLMs的过度自信随任务进展而恶化，推理模型表现与非推理模型相当或更差。部分LLMs能从失败经验中减少过度自信并改进决策，但并非所有模型都能做到。所有LLMs的决策在给定其估计成功率下大致理性，但过度乐观的估计导致决策质量差。

Conclusion: 当前LLM代理因缺乏对自身能力的准确认知而受到限制。LLMs对自身能力的认知不足会影响AI误用和错位风险，需要关注模型自我意识能力的发展。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict whether they will succeed on a given task and whether their predictions improve as they progress through multi-step tasks. We also investigate whether LLMs can learn from in-context experiences to make better decisions about whether to pursue a task in scenarios where failure is costly. All LLMs we tested are overconfident, but most predict their success with better-than-random discriminatory power. We find that newer and larger LLMs generally do not have greater discriminatory power, though Claude models do show such a trend. On multi-step agentic tasks, the overconfidence of several frontier LLMs worsens as they progress through the tasks, and reasoning LLMs perform comparably to or worse than non-reasoning LLMs. With in-context experiences of failure, some but not all LLMs reduce their overconfidence leading to significantly improved decision making, while others do not. Interestingly, all LLMs' decisions are approximately rational given their estimated probabilities of success, yet their overly-optimistic estimates result in poor decision making. These results suggest that current LLM agents are hindered by their lack of awareness of their own capabilities. We discuss the implications of LLMs' awareness of their capabilities for AI misuse and misalignment risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有辩论系统缺乏对历史论据的记忆和一致性维护能力，难以在长期辩论中保持立场连贯性并有效回应对手论点。

Method: 基于修辞学和记忆研究，构建包含案例证据和历史辩论动作的知识库，结合基于角色的智能体检索和适配历史论据，生成连贯的多轮辩论话语。

Result: 在ORCHID辩论数据集上，R-Debater在单轮话语生成和多轮对抗模拟中均优于强LLM基线，人类评估也证实其一致性和证据使用能力更强。

Conclusion: 检索式基础与结构化规划的结合能够产生更忠实、立场对齐且连贯的多轮辩论，展示了论证记忆在智能辩论系统中的重要性。

Abstract: We present R-Debater, an agentic framework for generating multi-turn debates built on argumentative memory. Grounded in rhetoric and memory studies, the system views debate as a process of recalling and adapting prior arguments to maintain stance consistency, respond to opponents, and support claims with evidence. Specifically, R-Debater integrates a debate knowledge base for retrieving case-like evidence and prior debate moves with a role-based agent that composes coherent utterances across turns. We evaluate on standardized ORCHID debates, constructing a 1,000-item retrieval corpus and a held-out set of 32 debates across seven domains. Two tasks are evaluated: next-utterance generation, assessed by InspireScore (subjective, logical, and factual), and adversarial multi-turn simulations, judged by Debatrix (argument, source, language, and overall). Compared with strong LLM baselines, R-Debater achieves higher single-turn and multi-turn scores. Human evaluation with 20 experienced debaters further confirms its consistency and evidence use, showing that combining retrieval grounding with structured planning yields more faithful, stance-aligned, and coherent debates across turns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮对话质量评估对LLM发展至关重要，但现有方法依赖昂贵的人工评估。标准偏好数据集仅基于最后一轮对话进行对比，无法捕捉多轮交互的细微差别，需要更有效的多轮评估方法。

Method: 提出MUSIC（多步指令对比）无监督数据增强策略，合成跨多个回合的对比对话对。基于Skywork偏好数据集，使用Gemma-2-9B-Instruct模型训练多轮奖励模型。

Result: MUSIC增强的奖励模型在多项评估中优于基线方法，在多轮对话上与先进专有LLM评判者的判断更一致，且不损害标准单轮奖励模型的基准性能。

Conclusion: 跨多轮对话的对比对于构建稳健的多轮奖励模型至关重要，MUSIC策略能有效提升多轮对话评估质量，为LLM训练提供可扩展的评估方案。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn conversations is crucial for developing capable Large Language Models (LLMs), yet remains a significant challenge, often requiring costly human evaluation. Multi-turn reward models (RMs) offer a scalable alternative and can provide valuable signals for guiding LLM training. While recent work has advanced multi-turn \textit{training} techniques, effective automated \textit{evaluation} specifically for multi-turn interactions lags behind. We observe that standard preference datasets, typically contrasting responses based only on the final conversational turn, provide insufficient signal to capture the nuances of multi-turn interactions. Instead, we find that incorporating contrasts spanning \textit{multiple} turns is critical for building robust multi-turn RMs. Motivated by this finding, we propose \textbf{MU}lti-\textbf{S}tep \textbf{I}nstruction \textbf{C}ontrast (MUSIC), an unsupervised data augmentation strategy that synthesizes contrastive conversation pairs exhibiting differences across multiple turns. Leveraging MUSIC on the Skywork preference dataset, we train a multi-turn RM based on the Gemma-2-9B-Instruct model. Empirical results demonstrate that our MUSIC-augmented RM outperforms baseline methods, achieving higher alignment with judgments from advanced proprietary LLM judges on multi-turn conversations, crucially, without compromising performance on standard single-turn RM benchmarks.

TL;DR: BIOME-Bench：首个用于评估LLM在多组学分析中生物分子交互推断和通路机制解析能力的标准化基准，发现现有模型在区分精细生物分子关系和生成可靠通路级解释方面存在显著不足


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多组学研究依赖通路富集分析，但传统方法存在通路资源的结构性限制（如更新滞后、功能冗余、对分子状态和干预敏感性有限）。虽然已有研究探索使用LLM改进通路富集分析，但缺乏标准化的端到端多组学通路机制解析基准，限制了可重复性进展。

Method: 通过严格的四阶段工作流程构建BIOME-Bench基准，评估LLM在多组学分析中的两个核心能力：1）生物分子交互推断；2）端到端多组学通路机制解析。开发了两种任务的评估协议，并在多个当代强模型上进行全面实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，现有模型在多组学分析中仍存在显著缺陷：难以可靠地区分精细粒度的生物分子关系类型，也无法生成忠实、稳健的通路级机制解释。

Conclusion: BIOME-Bench填补了多组学分析中LLM评估的标准化基准空白，揭示了当前模型在生物分子交互推断和通路机制解析方面的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要参考框架。

Abstract: Multi-omics studies often rely on pathway enrichment to interpret heterogeneous molecular changes, but pathway enrichment (PE)-based workflows inherit structural limitations of pathway resources, including curation lag, functional redundancy, and limited sensitivity to molecular states and interventions. Although recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) to improve PE-based interpretation, the lack of a standardized benchmark for end-to-end multi-omics pathway mechanism elucidation has largely confined evaluation to small, manually curated datasets or ad hoc case studies, hindering reproducible progress. To address this issue, we introduce BIOME-Bench, constructed via a rigorous four-stage workflow, to evaluate two core capabilities of LLMs in multi-omics analysis: Biomolecular Interaction Inference and end-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation. We develop evaluation protocols for both tasks and conduct comprehensive experiments across multiple strong contemporary models. Experimental results demonstrate that existing models still exhibit substantial deficiencies in multi-omics analysis, struggling to reliably distinguish fine-grained biomolecular relation types and to generate faithful, robust pathway-level mechanistic explanations.

Motivation: 社交媒体文本中的抑郁症检测面临语言风格多样、表达非正式、标注数据稀缺等挑战，特别是在多语言环境下资源有限的情况。

Result: 在阿拉伯语、孟加拉语、英语和西班牙语数据集上均优于基线方法，显著缩小资源丰富与资源匮乏设置之间的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该框架在多语言心理健康监测中具有有效性和可扩展性，特别适用于标注资源有限的跨语言应用场景。

Abstract: Detecting depression from social media text is still a challenging task. This is due to different language styles, informal expression, and the lack of annotated data in many languages. To tackle these issues, we propose, Semi-SMDNet, a strong Semi-Supervised Multilingual Depression detection Network. It combines teacher-student pseudo-labelling, ensemble learning, and augmentation of data. Our framework uses a group of teacher models. Their predictions come together through soft voting. An uncertainty-based threshold filters out low-confidence pseudo-labels to reduce noise and improve learning stability. We also use a confidence-weighted training method that focuses on reliable pseudo-labelled samples. This greatly boosts robustness across languages. Tests on Arabic, Bangla, English, and Spanish datasets show that our approach consistently beats strong baselines. It significantly reduces the performance gap between settings that have plenty of resources and those that do not. Detailed experiments and studies confirm that our framework is effective and can be used in various situations. This shows that it is suitable for scalable, cross-language mental health monitoring where labelled resources are limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究常忽视生成长推理序列的计算负担，而工业应用需同时考虑准确率、资源约束和推理成本，因此需要评估不同模型在计算效率与性能间的权衡

Method: 对当代和早期开源LLM进行测试时计算感知评估，在数学和推理密集型基准上绘制帕累托前沿，分析MoE架构优势，追踪帕累托效率随时间演变趋势

Result: 发现MoE架构在性能与效率平衡方面表现最佳；识别出推理计算存在饱和点，超过阈值后准确率增益递减；推导出单位计算准确率增益的涌现趋势

Conclusion: 扩展推理能力虽有益，但无法克服模型内在复杂性限制；MoE架构是平衡性能与效率的有力候选；测试时计算感知评估对工业应用模型选择至关重要

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are demonstrating rapid improvements on complex reasoning benchmarks, particularly when allowed to utilize intermediate reasoning steps before converging on a final solution. However, current literature often overlooks the significant computational burden associated with generating long reasoning sequences. For industrial applications, model selection depends not only on raw accuracy but also on resource constraints and inference costs. In this work, we conduct a test-time-compute aware evaluation of both contemporary and older open-source LLMs, mapping their Pareto frontiers across math- and reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Our findings identify the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture as a strong candidate to balance performance and efficiency in our evaluation setting. Furthermore, we trace the trajectory of Pareto efficiency over time to derive an emergent trend regarding accuracy gain per unit of compute. Finally, we demonstrate that there is a saturation point for inference-time compute. Beyond a certain threshold, accuracy gains diminish, indicating that while extended reasoning capabilities are beneficial, they cannot overcome intrinsic model limitations regarding specific complexities.

Abstract: As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems become more pervasive, integrating ethical considerations into NLP education has become essential. However, this presents inherent challenges in curriculum development: the field's rapid evolution from both academia and industry, and the need to foster critical thinking beyond traditional technical training. We introduce our course on Ethical Aspects in NLP and our pedagogical approach, grounded in active learning through interactive sessions, hands-on activities, and "learning by teaching" methods. Over four years, the course has been refined and adapted across different institutions, educational levels, and interdisciplinary backgrounds; it has also yielded many reusable products, both in the form of teaching materials and in the form of actual educational products aimed at diverse audiences, made by the students themselves. By sharing our approach and experience, we hope to provide inspiration for educators seeking to incorporate social impact considerations into their curricula.

TL;DR: 提出因果三角验证方法，用于在多语言环境中验证神经网络的机制性解释，要求电路在保持语义的变体上具有必要性、充分性和不变性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型在整体表现良好，但在不同语言、文字和文化中的行为难以预测。现有机制性解释缺乏因果验证标准，容易产生虚假电路。

Method: 提出"三角验证"方法：1)定义参考家族作为保持谓词的变体；2)要求电路满足必要性（消融会降低目标行为）、充分性（激活补丁能传递行为）和不变性（在参考家族中保持稳定）；3)结合自动电路发现，通过三角验证接受或拒绝候选电路。

Result: 将三角验证形式化为因果抽象框架下的近似变换分数，建立了与实用可解释性议程的连接，并设计了跨模型家族、语言对和任务的比较实验协议。

Conclusion: 三角验证提供了可证伪的机制性解释标准，能够过滤掉通过单环境测试但在跨语言不变性上失败的虚假电路，提高了多语言模型机制解释的可靠性。

Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.

Motivation: 个性化AI代理需要访问用户数字足迹（包含敏感数据），但缺乏社会情境意识的系统可能无意中泄露用户秘密，威胁数字福祉和隐私安全

Method: 引入PrivacyBench基准，包含社会情境数据集（嵌入秘密）和多轮对话评估，测试RAG助手在秘密保护方面的表现，并评估隐私提示的缓解效果

Result: RAG助手在多达26.56%的交互中泄露秘密；添加隐私意识提示可将泄露率降低至5.12%，但检索机制仍会无差别访问敏感数据，将隐私保护负担完全转移到生成器

Conclusion: 当前架构存在单点故障风险，不适合大规模部署，迫切需要结构化的、隐私优先设计的安全保障措施，以确保伦理和包容的网络环境

Abstract: Personalized AI agents rely on access to a user's digital footprint, which often includes sensitive data from private emails, chats and purchase histories. Yet this access creates a fundamental societal and privacy risk: systems lacking social-context awareness can unintentionally expose user secrets, threatening digital well-being. We introduce PrivacyBench, a benchmark with socially grounded datasets containing embedded secrets and a multi-turn conversational evaluation to measure secret preservation. Testing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistants reveals that they leak secrets in up to 26.56% of interactions. A privacy-aware prompt lowers leakage to 5.12%, yet this measure offers only partial mitigation. The retrieval mechanism continues to access sensitive data indiscriminately, which shifts the entire burden of privacy preservation onto the generator. This creates a single point of failure, rendering current architectures unsafe for wide-scale deployment. Our findings underscore the urgent need for structural, privacy-by-design safeguards to ensure an ethical and inclusive web for everyone.

TL;DR: Encyclo-K：基于知识陈述的动态评估基准，通过从权威教材提取独立知识陈述并在测试时随机组合成问题，解决传统基准的数据污染、单知识点评估和专家标注成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准主要基于问题级别构建，存在三个根本限制：1) 易受数据污染影响；2) 局限于单知识点评估；3) 依赖昂贵的领域专家标注。需要一种新的基准构建方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 从权威教材中提取独立的知识陈述作为基本单元，在测试时通过随机抽样动态组合成评估问题（每个问题聚合8-10个陈述）。标注者只需验证格式合规性，无需领域专业知识。

Result: 在50多个LLM上的实验表明，Encyclo-K具有强区分能力。表现最好的OpenAI-GPT-5.1仅达到62.07%准确率。推理模型准确率在16.04%-62.07%之间，聊天模型在9.71%-50.40%之间，显示清晰的梯度分布。

Conclusion: Encyclo-K通过动态评估和多陈述综合理解引入的挑战得到验证，为LLM在多个细粒度学科知识陈述上的综合理解提供了可扩展的动态评估框架。

Abstract: Benchmarks play a crucial role in tracking the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and identifying their capability boundaries. However, existing benchmarks predominantly curate questions at the question level, suffering from three fundamental limitations: vulnerability to data contamination, restriction to single-knowledge-point assessment, and reliance on costly domain expert annotation. We propose Encyclo-K, a statement-based benchmark that rethinks benchmark construction from the ground up. Our key insight is that knowledge statements, not questions, can serve as the unit of curation, and questions can then be constructed from them. We extract standalone knowledge statements from authoritative textbooks and dynamically compose them into evaluation questions through random sampling at test time. This design directly addresses all three limitations: the combinatorial space is too vast to memorize, and model rankings remain stable across dynamically generated question sets, enabling reliable periodic dataset refresh; each question aggregates 8-10 statements for comprehensive multi-knowledge assessment; annotators only verify formatting compliance without requiring domain expertise, substantially reducing annotation costs. Experiments on over 50 LLMs demonstrate that Encyclo-K poses substantial challenges with strong discriminative power. Even the top-performing OpenAI-GPT-5.1 achieves only 62.07% accuracy, and model performance displays a clear gradient distribution--reasoning models span from 16.04% to 62.07%, while chat models range from 9.71% to 50.40%. These results validate the challenges introduced by dynamic evaluation and multi-statement comprehensive understanding. These findings establish Encyclo-K as a scalable framework for dynamic evaluation of LLMs' comprehensive understanding over multiple fine-grained disciplinary knowledge statements.

TL;DR: 提出Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC)框架，通过将HC的残差连接空间投影到特定流形来恢复恒等映射特性，解决HC训练不稳定和可扩展性受限问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Hyper-Connections (HC)扩展了残差连接范式，带来了性能提升，但破坏了残差连接固有的恒等映射特性，导致训练不稳定、可扩展性受限和内存访问开销增加

Method: 提出mHC框架，将HC的残差连接空间投影到特定流形以恢复恒等映射特性，同时结合严格的基础设施优化确保效率

Result: mHC在大规模训练中有效，提供实质性性能改进和优越的可扩展性

Conclusion: mHC作为HC的灵活实用扩展，将有助于深入理解拓扑架构设计，为基础模型的演进指明有前景的方向

Abstract: Recently, studies exemplified by Hyper-Connections (HC) have extended the ubiquitous residual connection paradigm established over the past decade by expanding the residual stream width and diversifying connectivity patterns. While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the identity mapping property intrinsic to the residual connection, which causes severe training instability and restricted scalability, and additionally incurs notable memory access overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC), a general framework that projects the residual connection space of HC onto a specific manifold to restore the identity mapping property, while incorporating rigorous infrastructure optimization to ensure efficiency. Empirical experiments demonstrate that mHC is effective for training at scale, offering tangible performance improvements and superior scalability. We anticipate that mHC, as a flexible and practical extension of HC, will contribute to a deeper understanding of topological architecture design and suggest promising directions for the evolution of foundational models.

TL;DR: BEDA框架通过将信念估计作为生成约束，提升战略对话中对抗、合作、协商等场景的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然能准确估计信念，但缺乏在生成过程中使用这些信念的原则性机制，导致战略对话效果受限

Method: 提出BEDA框架：1) 形式化对抗和对齐两种核心对话行为；2) 通过概率约束将信念估计转化为生成约束；3) 包含世界集合、信念估计器和条件生成器三个组件

Result: 在三个场景中均优于基线：CKBG（对抗）成功率提升至少5.0点（GPT-4.1-nano提升20.6点）；Mutual Friends（合作）平均提升9.3点；CaSiNo（协商）达到最优协议

Conclusion: 将信念估计作为约束提供了一种简单通用的机制，能够实现可靠的战略对话

Abstract: Strategic dialogue requires agents to execute distinct dialogue acts, for which belief estimation is essential. While prior work often estimates beliefs accurately, it lacks a principled mechanism to use those beliefs during generation. We bridge this gap by first formalizing two core acts Adversarial and Alignment, and by operationalizing them via probabilistic constraints on what an agent may generate. We instantiate this idea in BEDA, a framework that consists of the world set, the belief estimator for belief estimation, and the conditional generator that selects acts and realizes utterances consistent with the inferred beliefs. Across three settings, Conditional Keeper Burglar (CKBG, adversarial), Mutual Friends (MF, cooperative), and CaSiNo (negotiation), BEDA consistently outperforms strong baselines: on CKBG it improves success rate by at least 5.0 points across backbones and by 20.6 points with GPT-4.1-nano; on Mutual Friends it achieves an average improvement of 9.3 points; and on CaSiNo it achieves the optimal deal relative to all baselines. These results indicate that casting belief estimation as constraints provides a simple, general mechanism for reliable strategic dialogue.

TL;DR: ADOPT是一个自适应依赖感知的提示优化框架，专门为多步LLM管道设计，通过显式建模步骤间依赖关系和Shapley值资源分配，实现更稳定有效的提示优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多步LLM管道的性能严重依赖每一步的提示，但联合优化这些提示很困难，因为缺乏步骤级监督和步骤间依赖关系。现有的端到端优化方法在这些条件下表现不佳，常常产生次优或不稳定的更新。

Method: ADOPT框架显式建模每个LLM步骤与最终任务结果之间的依赖关系，实现类似计算解析导数的精确文本梯度估计。它将文本梯度估计与梯度更新解耦，将多提示优化简化为灵活的单提示优化步骤，并采用基于Shapley值的机制自适应分配优化资源。

Result: 在真实世界数据集和多样化管道结构上的实验表明，ADOPT是有效且稳健的，始终优于最先进的提示优化基线方法。

Conclusion: ADOPT通过显式建模步骤依赖关系和自适应资源分配，解决了多步LLM管道提示优化的核心挑战，为复杂任务的多步LLM管道提供了更稳定有效的优化方案。

Abstract: Multi-step LLM pipelines invoke large language models multiple times in a structured sequence and can effectively solve complex tasks, but their performance heavily depends on the prompts used at each step. Jointly optimizing these prompts is difficult due to missing step-level supervision and inter-step dependencies. Existing end-to-end prompt optimization methods struggle under these conditions and often yield suboptimal or unstable updates. We propose ADOPT, an Adaptive Dependency-aware Prompt Optimization framework for multi-step LLM pipelines. ADOPT explicitly models the dependency between each LLM step and the final task outcome, enabling precise text-gradient estimation analogous to computing analytical derivatives. It decouples textual gradient estimation from gradient updates, reducing multi-prompt optimization to flexible single-prompt optimization steps, and employs a Shapley-based mechanism to adaptively allocate optimization resources. Experiments on real-world datasets and diverse pipeline structures show that ADOPT is effective and robust, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art prompt optimization baselines.

*Nasim Borazjanizadeh,James McClelland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Thought Gestalt模型，一种双层次抽象（token和句子级"思想"状态）的循环Transformer，通过记忆机制提升语言建模的全局一致性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer主要依赖表层共现统计，缺乏对实体和事件的全局一致潜在表示，导致关系方向（如逆转诅咒）、上下文化错误和数据效率低下。受认知科学启发，人类理解语言时会将其转换为紧凑的事件式表示，而字面形式短暂存在。

Method: 提出Thought Gestalt模型：1）在token和句子级"思想"状态两个抽象层次建模语言；2）逐句生成token，同时交叉关注先前句子表示的记忆；3）使用相同参数集生成token和句子表示，通过单一目标（下一个token交叉熵）训练；4）保留写入记忆的句子表示计算图，使未来token损失的梯度通过交叉注意力反向传播，优化早期句子向量的生成参数。

Result: 1）在扩展实验中，TG始终比匹配的GPT-2运行更高效，缩放拟合表明GPT-2需要多5-8%的数据和33-42%的参数才能达到TG的损失水平；2）在父子逆转诅咒探针上，TG减少了关系方向泛化错误。

Conclusion: Thought Gestalt模型通过引入句子级表示记忆机制，模仿人类认知中的事件式表示，有效提升了语言模型的全局一致性、数据效率和关系方向泛化能力。

Abstract: Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficiency. On the other hand, cognitive science shows that human comprehension involves converting the input linguistic stream into compact, event-like representations that persist in memory while verbatim form is short-lived. Motivated by this view, we introduce Thought Gestalt (TG) model, a recurrent Transformer that models language at two levels of abstraction - tokens and sentence-level "thought" states. TG generates the tokens of one sentence at a time while cross-attending to a memory of prior sentence representations. In TG, token and sentence representations are generated using the same set of model parameters and trained with a single objective, the next-token cross-entropy: by retaining the computation graph of sentence representations written to memory, gradients from future token losses flow backward through cross-attention to optimize the parameters generating earlier sentence vectors. In scaling experiments, TG consistently improves efficiency over matched GPT-2 runs, among other baselines, with scaling fits indicating GPT-2 requires ~5-8% more data and ~33-42% more parameters to match TG's loss. TG also reduces errors on relational direction generalization on a father-son reversal curse probe.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaGReS是一个用于检索增强生成的冗余感知上下文选择框架，通过结合查询-文档相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的集合级目标，在token预算约束下优化上下文选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准top-k检索方法经常返回冗余或近似重复的文本块，这会浪费token预算并降低下游生成质量。现有方法缺乏对冗余的有效控制，且需要手动调整相关性与冗余之间的权衡参数。

Method: AdaGReS框架：1）定义结合查询-文档相关性和集合内冗余惩罚的集合级目标函数；2）在token预算约束下使用基于边际增益的贪心选择算法；3）引入闭式、实例自适应的校准方法来自动调整相关性与冗余的权衡参数，无需手动调参；4）提供理论分析证明目标函数在实用嵌入相似性条件下具有epsilon近似子模性。

Result: 在开放域问答（Natural Questions）和高冗余生物医学（药物）语料库上的实验表明，AdaGReS在冗余控制和上下文质量方面持续改进，转化为更好的端到端答案质量和跨设置的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGReS通过冗余感知的上下文选择和自适应参数校准，有效解决了RAG中冗余浪费token预算的问题，提供了理论保证并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-set redundancy penalties. AdaGReS performs greedy selection under a token-budget constraint using marginal gains derived from the objective, and introduces a closed-form, instance-adaptive calibration of the relevance-redundancy trade-off parameter to eliminate manual tuning and adapt to candidate-pool statistics and budget limits. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed objective exhibits epsilon-approximate submodularity under practical embedding similarity conditions, yielding near-optimality guarantees for greedy selection. Experiments on open-domain question answering (Natural Questions) and a high-redundancy biomedical (drug) corpus demonstrate consistent improvements in redundancy control and context quality, translating to better end-to-end answer quality and robustness across settings.

Motivation: 现有文本驱动的3D人体运动编辑方法虽然取得显著进展，但由于其全局建模特性，难以精确控制细节化的、特定部位的运动

Method: 1. 部件感知运动调制模块：基于预定义的五部分身体分解，动态预测每个身体部件的时间变化调制权重；2. 部件级相似度曲线监督机制：采用双层归一化增强，帮助学习语义一致且可编辑的分布；3. 双向运动交互模块：利用双向跨模态注意力实现文本指令与运动语义的精确对齐

Result: 在知名基准测试上的广泛定量和定性评估表明，PartMotionEdit优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: PartMotionEdit通过部件级语义调制实现了精确、可解释的局部运动编辑，解决了现有方法在细粒度控制方面的局限性

Abstract: Existing text-driven 3D human motion editing methods have demonstrated significant progress, but are still difficult to precisely control over detailed, part-specific motions due to their global modeling nature. In this paper, we propose PartMotionEdit, a novel fine-grained motion editing framework that operates via part-level semantic modulation. The core of PartMotionEdit is a Part-aware Motion Modulation (PMM) module, which builds upon a predefined five-part body decomposition. PMM dynamically predicts time-varying modulation weights for each body part, enabling precise and interpretable editing of local motions. To guide the training of PMM, we also introduce a part-level similarity curve supervision mechanism enhanced with dual-layer normalization. This mechanism assists PMM in learning semantically consistent and editable distributions across all body parts. Furthermore, we design a Bidirectional Motion Interaction (BMI) module. It leverages bidirectional cross-modal attention to achieve more accurate semantic alignment between textual instructions and motion semantics. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a well-known benchmark demonstrate that PartMotionEdit outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: BATISNet：一种用于牙齿点云分割的边界感知实例网络，通过结合语义特征和实例特征学习，在复杂临床场景（如缺牙、错位牙）中实现更鲁棒和准确的牙齿实例分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有牙齿点云分割方法主要采用语义分割，关注不同类型牙齿之间的语义特征。但由于牙齿结构紧密、边界不清以及复杂病例（如缺牙、错位牙）的多样性，语义分割在处理复杂牙科病例时往往难以获得满意结果。

Method: 提出BATISNet网络，由特征提取主干和实例分割模块组成。不仅提取不同类型牙齿的语义特征，还学习单个牙齿的实例特征。此外设计了边界感知损失函数，专门监督实例间的边界分割，有效缓解牙齿粘连和边界模糊问题。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，BATISNet在牙齿完整性分割方面优于现有方法，为实际临床应用提供了更可靠和详细的数据支持。

Conclusion: BATISNet通过边界感知的实例分割方法，在复杂临床场景中实现了更鲁棒和准确的牙齿点云分割，解决了传统语义分割在处理紧密排列、边界不清牙齿时的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the tooth point cloud is of great significance for diagnosis clinical assisting and treatment planning. Existing methods mostly employ semantic segmentation, focusing on the semantic feature between different types of teeth. However, due to the tightly packed structure of teeth, unclear boundaries, and the diversity of complex cases such as missing teeth, malposed teeth, semantic segmentation often struggles to achieve satisfactory results when dealing with complex dental cases. To address these issues, this paper propose BATISNet, a boundary-aware instance network for tooth point cloud segmentation. This network model consists of a feature extraction backbone and an instance segmentation module. It not only focuses on extracting the semantic features of different types of teeth but also learns the instance features of individual teeth. It helps achieve more robust and accurate tooth instance segmentation in complex clinical scenarios such as missing teeth and malposed teeth. Additionally, to further enhance the completeness and accuracy of tooth boundary segmentation, a boundary-aware loss function is designed to specifically supervise the boundary segmentation between instances. It mitigates effectively tooth adhesion and boundary ambiguity issues. Extensive experimental results show that BATISNet outperforms existing methods in tooth integrity segmentation, providing more reliable and detailed data support for practical clinical applications.

Motivation: 当前视觉特效生成流程缺乏物理真实性和高效语言接口，需要耗时的离线优化。现有方法无法实现实时、物理准确、交互式的4D动画生成

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅场景作为输入，通过大语言模型生成可执行代码，通过轻量级代理和粒子动力学直接修改3DGS参数，无需网格提取直接耦合物理模拟器

Result: 实现了首个无需训练、计算轻量的开放词汇物理动画框架，支持实时、碰撞感知、基于物理的多材质对象操作，将工作流从"渲染等待"转变为交互对话

Conclusion: PhysTalk通过将3DGS直接与物理模拟器耦合，实现了开放词汇的实时物理动画生成，使4D动画制作更加普及和交互化

Abstract: Realistic visual simulations are omnipresent, yet their creation requires computing time, rendering, and expert animation knowledge. Open-vocabulary visual effects generation from text inputs emerges as a promising solution that can unlock immense creative potential. However, current pipelines lack both physical realism and effective language interfaces, requiring slow offline optimization. In contrast, PhysTalk takes a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene as input and translates arbitrary user prompts into real time, physics based, interactive 4D animations. A large language model (LLM) generates executable code that directly modifies 3DGS parameters through lightweight proxies and particle dynamics. Notably, PhysTalk is the first framework to couple 3DGS directly with a physics simulator without relying on time consuming mesh extraction. While remaining open vocabulary, this design enables interactive 3D Gaussian animation via collision aware, physics based manipulation of arbitrary, multi material objects. Finally, PhysTalk is train-free and computationally lightweight: this makes 4D animation broadly accessible and shifts these workflows from a "render and wait" paradigm toward an interactive dialogue with a modern, physics-informed pipeline.

### [177] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出DDFT评估框架，测量语言模型在语义压缩和对抗性伪造下的认知稳健性，发现模型稳健性与参数规模和架构类型无关，而与错误检测能力密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型评估（如MMLU、TruthfulQA）只能测量理想条件下的知识掌握情况，无法评估模型在现实压力下的认知稳健性。这些静态基准无法区分模型是缺乏知识，还是在信息质量下降或面临对抗性攻击时验证机制崩溃。

Method: 提出Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT)协议，测量认知稳健性：模型在渐进语义压缩和对抗性伪造下保持事实准确性的能力。采用两系统认知模型：语义系统生成流畅文本，认知验证器验证事实准确性。评估了9个前沿模型在8个知识领域和5个压缩级别（共1800次轮级评估）。

Result: 认知稳健性与传统设计范式正交：参数数量（r=0.083, p=0.832）和架构类型（r=0.153, p=0.695）均不显著预测稳健性。错误检测能力强烈预测整体稳健性（rho=-0.817, p=0.007）。旗舰模型尽管规模大但表现出脆弱性，而较小模型可以取得稳健性能。

Conclusion: 认知稳健性源于训练方法和验证机制，与当前主流方法不同。DDFT框架为关键应用部署前评估认知稳健性提供了理论基础和实用工具，挑战了模型规模与可靠性关系的传统假设。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

Conclusion: CASCADE能够积累可执行的技能，这些技能可以在智能体和科学家之间共享，推动了可扩展的AI辅助科学研究的发展，代表了从"LLM+工具使用"向"LLM+技能获取"的重要转变。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

Conclusion: McCoy通过整合LLMs和ASP，创建了一个强大且可解释的预测框架，克服了传统符号AI在医疗领域应用中的障碍，充分利用了两种范式的优势。

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

*Gaurab Chhetri,Subasish Das,Tausif Islam Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPARK是一个基于多智能体LLM的个性化搜索框架，通过角色化智能体协作实现动态查询理解和个性化检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化搜索系统受限于静态用户画像和单一检索流程，无法捕捉用户动态、多维的信息需求。需要一种能够建模用户演化需求、支持细粒度专业化和协作检索的新框架。

Method: 1. 定义角色空间（角色、专业领域、任务上下文、领域）；2. 引入角色协调器动态激活相关专业智能体；3. 每个智能体执行独立的检索增强生成过程，配备长短期记忆存储和上下文感知推理模块；4. 通过结构化通信协议（共享内存库、迭代辩论、接力式知识传递）促进智能体协作。

Result: SPARK框架能够产生可测试的预测，包括协调效率、个性化质量和认知负荷分布。通过分布式智能体行为和最小协调规则，实现涌现的个性化特性。

Conclusion: SPARK通过整合细粒度智能体专业化和协作检索，为下一代搜索系统提供了洞察，能够捕捉人类信息寻求行为的复杂性、流动性和上下文敏感性。

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

TL;DR: ROAD框架通过自动化调试而非随机搜索优化LLM提示，无需标注数据集，利用多智能体架构将失败日志转化为决策树协议，在冷启动场景中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实软件工程中，LLM代理开发初期缺乏标注数据集，只有混乱的生产日志和不断演变的失败模式，传统依赖黄金标准开发集的自动提示优化方法不适用。

Method: ROAD采用多智能体架构：分析器进行根因分析，优化器进行模式聚合，教练进行策略整合，将非结构化失败日志转化为结构化决策树协议，模拟人类工程师的调试循环。

Result: 在学术基准和实际知识管理引擎中，ROAD仅通过三次自动化迭代就使成功率提升5.6%（73.6%到79.2%），搜索准确率提升3.8%；在零售领域复杂推理任务中，相对基线提升约19%。

Conclusion: 模拟人类工程师的失败分析和修复循环为部署可靠LLM代理提供了数据高效、资源节约的替代方案，相比资源密集的强化学习训练更具可行性。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) has emerged as a critical technique for enhancing Large Language Model (LLM) performance, yet current state-of-the-art methods typically rely on large, labeled gold-standard development sets to compute fitness scores for evolutionary or Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. In real-world software engineering, however, such curated datasets are rarely available during the initial cold start of agent development, where engineers instead face messy production logs and evolving failure modes. We present ROAD (Reflective Optimization via Automated Debugging), a novel framework that bypasses the need for refined datasets by treating optimization as a dynamic debugging investigation rather than a stochastic search. Unlike traditional mutation strategies, ROAD utilizes a specialized multi-agent architecture, comprising an Analyzer for root-cause analysis, an Optimizer for pattern aggregation, and a Coach for strategy integration, to convert unstructured failure logs into robust, structured Decision Tree Protocols. We evaluated ROAD across both a standardized academic benchmark and a live production Knowledge Management engine. Experimental results demonstrate that ROAD is highly sample-efficient, achieving a 5.6 percent increase in success rate (73.6 percent to 79.2 percent) and a 3.8 percent increase in search accuracy within just three automated iterations. Furthermore, on complex reasoning tasks in the retail domain, ROAD improved agent performance by approximately 19 percent relative to the baseline. These findings suggest that mimicking the human engineering loop of failure analysis and patching offers a viable, data-efficient alternative to resource-intensive RL training for deploying reliable LLM agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LoongFlow是一个自进化代理框架，通过将LLM集成到"计划-执行-总结"认知范式中，显著提高了进化效率，在算法发现和机器学习管道优化中优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从静态大语言模型向自改进代理的转变受到传统进化方法缺乏结构化推理的限制。现有方法在高维代码空间中经常面临早熟收敛和探索效率低下的问题。

Method: LoongFlow框架将LLM集成到认知"计划-执行-总结"范式中，将进化搜索映射为推理密集型过程。采用混合进化记忆系统，结合多岛模型、MAP-Elites和自适应玻尔兹曼选择，平衡探索与利用的权衡。

Result: 在AlphaEvolve基准测试和Kaggle竞赛中，LoongFlow比领先基线方法（如OpenEvolve、ShinkaEvolve）在进化效率上提升高达60%，同时发现更优的解决方案。

Conclusion: LoongFlow在自主科学发现方面迈出了重要一步，能够以更低的计算开销生成专家级解决方案，标志着从静态LLM到自进化代理的重要进展。

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

TL;DR: CogRec是一个结合大语言模型与Soar认知架构的推荐系统，利用LLM进行知识初始化，通过Soar的符号推理和分块机制实现在线学习，提高推荐准确性、可解释性和长尾问题处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推荐系统中表现出理解用户偏好的能力，但存在"黑盒"特性、知识幻觉和在线学习能力有限等问题，影响可信度和适应性。而Soar等认知架构虽然推理过程结构化可解释，但知识获取困难。需要结合两者优势解决互补挑战。

Method: 提出CogRec认知推荐代理，以Soar为核心符号推理引擎，利用LLM进行知识初始化填充工作记忆中的产生式规则。采用感知-认知-行动(PCA)循环，遇到僵局时动态查询LLM获取推理解决方案，通过Soar的分块机制将解决方案转化为新的符号产生式规则，实现鲁棒的在线学习。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛评估表明，CogRec在推荐准确性、可解释性以及处理长尾问题方面表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: CogRec成功结合了LLMs和Soar认知架构的优势，通过LLM进行知识初始化，利用Soar的符号推理和分块机制实现持续在线学习，为推荐系统提供了高度可解释的推理过程，同时提高了准确性和长尾问题处理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、基于图结构的交互推理方法，在ARC-AGI-3基准测试中显著优于当前最先进的大语言模型，通过系统化的状态空间探索和视觉处理解决游戏式任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的大语言模型在ARC-AGI-3基准测试中表现不佳，该基准包含需要交互推理的游戏式任务，要求智能体通过有限交互推断任务机制并适应复杂度递增的关卡。需要一种能够有效进行假设形成、测试和机制跟踪的方法。

Method: 结合基于视觉的帧处理与系统化的状态空间探索，使用图结构表示。方法包括：将视觉帧分割为有意义的组件，基于视觉显著性优先选择动作，维护已探索状态和转换的有向图，通过跟踪已访问状态和已测试动作，优先选择能提供最短路径到达未测试状态-动作对的动作。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3预览挑战中，该方法在6个游戏的52个关卡中解决了中位数30个关卡，在私有排行榜上排名第3，显著优于前沿的大语言模型智能体。

Conclusion: 即使没有学习，显式的图结构探索也能作为交互推理的强大基线，突显了在稀疏反馈环境中系统化状态跟踪和动作优先级的重要性，这些环境中当前的大语言模型无法捕捉任务动态。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

Motivation: FSMVRP需要同时决策车队组成和路径规划，在现实场景中应用广泛，但复杂度高，特别是在大规模和时间受限环境下存在显著挑战。

Method: 将问题建模为马尔可夫决策过程，开发了名为FRIPN的新型策略网络，整合车队组成和路径决策，采用专门设计的输入嵌入，包括剩余图嵌入以促进有效的车辆使用决策。

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际应用潜力，并为将基于DRL的技术扩展到其他VRP变体提供了有价值的启发。

Abstract: The Fleet Size and Mix Vehicle Routing Problem (FSMVRP) is a prominent variant of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), extensively studied in operations research and computational science. FSMVRP requires simultaneous decisions on fleet composition and routing, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios such as short-term vehicle rental and on-demand logistics. However, these requirements also increase the complexity of FSMVRP, posing significant challenges, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained environments. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach for solving FSMVRP, capable of generating near-optimal solutions within a few seconds. Specifically, we formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and develop a novel policy network, termed FRIPN, that seamlessly integrates fleet composition and routing decisions. Our method incorporates specialized input embeddings designed for distinctdecision objectives, including a remaining graph embedding to facilitate effective vehicle employment decisions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on both randomly generated instances and benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits notable advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability, particularly in large-scale and time-constrained scenarios. These strengths highlight the potential of our approach for practical applications and provide valuable inspiration for extending DRL-based techniques to other variants of VRP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法（如Safe RLHF和SACPO）通常采用风险中性范式，无法充分处理参考策略偏离带来的风险，且对罕见但潜在灾难性有害行为的鲁棒性有限。

Method: 提出RSA方法，将安全对齐建模为token级别的风险感知约束策略优化问题，通过逐步对齐过程解决，利用嵌套风险度量推导token级策略更新。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持高帮助性的同时确保强安全性，显著抑制了低概率高影响的尾部风险（不安全响应）。

Conclusion: RSA通过明确的风险意识设计，有效解决了传统对齐方法的局限性，在风险控制和模型安全性方面表现出色。

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Conclusion: 提出的测试时自适应智能体通过后验引导的信念精化，能够在部分可观测环境下有效进行探索性推理，无需梯度更新或额外训练，显著提高了世界状态对齐能力并降低了集成复杂度

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对基础模型空间能力的评估主要依赖静态地图输入或文本查询，忽视了空间理解的交互性和经验驱动特性。需要开发能够评估智能体在动态探索中如何获取、记忆和利用空间知识的框架。

Method: 提出交互式评估框架，让智能体在部分可观测的网格地图中增量探索（包含道路、交叉口和兴趣点），每步仅接收局部观测。使用六种空间任务评估空间理解能力，系统变化探索策略、记忆表示和推理方案。

Result: 探索主要影响经验获取但对最终推理准确性影响有限；记忆表示在整合空间经验中起核心作用，结构化记忆（特别是序列和图表示）显著提升路径规划等结构密集型任务性能；推理方案影响存储知识的利用方式，高级提示支持更有效的多步推理；空间推理性能在模型版本和规模达到一定阈值后趋于饱和。

Conclusion: 提升基于地图的空间理解需要专门针对空间表示和推理的机制，而不仅仅是模型缩放。探索、记忆和推理组件在空间能力中扮演不同功能角色，结构化记忆对空间任务至关重要。

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

Motivation: 现有研究大多使用相同的数据集评估LLMs的数学推理能力，这限制了研究结果的普适性，可能无法完全捕捉数学任务中的多样化挑战。本研究旨在分析LLMs在代表性不足的数学竞赛问题上的表现。

Method: 使用密苏里大学数学竞赛中的微积分、解析几何和离散数学问题，对GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3三个领先LLMs进行测试。将LLMs的响应与已知正确答案进行比较，确定每个问题领域的准确性，并分析推理过程以探索错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个类别中表现最佳，无论是推理还是最终答案正确性。所有三个LLMs在几何问题上都表现出明显薄弱。DeepSeek-V3的错误主要归因于计算和逻辑错误，GPT-4o-mini经常出现逻辑和方法相关错误，而Gemini则倾向于推理不完整和匆忙得出结论。

Conclusion: 在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上评估LLMs可以提供对其独特错误模式的更深入洞察，并突显在结构化推理方面的持续挑战，特别是在几何领域。这有助于更全面地理解LLMs的数学推理局限性。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出两阶段方法提升LLM空间推理能力：先通过监督微调学习基础空间变换物理知识，再冻结模型训练轻量级LoRA适配器进行多步规划，在ASCII艺术环境中表现优于基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在通用语言能力上表现优异，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划方面仍存在困难，需要提升其空间推理能力以支持导航和规划等应用

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 监督微调学习基础空间变换（旋转、平移、缩放）的物理知识；2) 冻结物理感知模型，在GRPO框架下训练轻量级LoRA适配器，以组合这些基础模块进行多步规划；创建ASCII艺术数据集和相应强化学习环境

Result: 方法在动态环境（显式状态更新）和静态环境（依赖内部状态）中均优于基线（通用骨干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型），收敛更快且训练更稳定；注意力模式分析显示微调确实改善了空间理解

Conclusion: 通过分解空间推理为原子构建块及其组合的两阶段方法，有效提升了LLM的空间推理能力，为导航和规划应用提供了更可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Method: 构建包含真实任务和模拟MCP工具的数据集，采用动态沙箱环境并引入干扰工具，设计综合指标衡量任务完成率和执行效率

Result: 实验显示不同主流LLM在处理复杂多步工具调用时存在显著性能差异

Conclusion: MCPAgentBench为评估LLM代理工具使用能力提供了有效基准，所有代码已开源

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.

TL;DR: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs），通过让LLM递归处理长提示来突破上下文窗口限制，实现两个数量级的扩展，在多个长上下文任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）受限于固定的上下文窗口长度，无法处理任意长的提示。现有方法要么截断输入，要么使用昂贵的扩展技术，需要解决LLM处理长文本的能力瓶颈。

Method: 提出递归语言模型（RLMs）推理策略：将长提示视为外部环境，让LLM以编程方式检查、分解提示，并递归调用自身处理提示片段。模型学会如何有效分解长输入并整合信息。

Result: RLMs成功处理比模型上下文窗口长两个数量级的输入，在四个不同的长上下文任务中，即使对于较短提示，也显著优于基础LLMs和常见长上下文框架，同时保持相当（或更低）的查询成本。

Conclusion: RLMs提供了一种通用推理策略，使LLMs能够有效处理任意长提示，突破了传统上下文窗口的限制，为长文本处理提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂工作流中的可靠协作提供了实用路径，通过强化学习增强LLM多智能体协作能力，显著提升协作效率和任务质量

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架面临两大挑战：1）配置成本高，需要大量人工工具集成和提示工程；2）能力静态，难以适应动态环境而不进行昂贵的微调

Method: 提出模块化框架，包含结构化配置系统（解耦执行环境、工具集和上下文管理），支持两种生成范式：工作流模式（标准任务）和元代理模式（复杂需求）。建立混合策略优化系统：1）代理实践模块（通过上下文优化积累经验）；2）代理RL模块（集成分布式训练框架进行端到端强化学习）

Conclusion: Youtu-Agent通过自动化生成和持续进化机制，有效解决了LLM代理框架的高配置成本和静态能力问题，为构建自适应智能代理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多模态融合和双重解耦实现了更全面的表示学习和更强的域泛化能力，为智能故障诊断提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Conclusion: 该框架为电池安全管理提供了从"被动检测"到"智能诊断"的新范式转变，通过结合物理知识与LLM推理能力，实现了可解释的故障诊断

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然具备广泛领域知识，但往往无法捕捉对预测任务至关重要的数据集特定模式。基础模型依赖通用领域理解，而统计建模需要特定特征，两者之间存在鸿沟。

Method: 通过迭代过程发现语义特征描述，对比统计建模误差识别的项目组。采用广义EM算法联合优化语义特征描述符和统计模型参数，将冻结基础模型的分类判断视为潜在二元特征的噪声观测。

Result: 在房价预测中，使用多模态列表数据发现的语义特征实现12%中位数相对误差，显著优于GPT-5基准（38%误差）。在Netflix电影推荐中，仅从语义描述预测协同过滤表示，达到0.59余弦相似度，相当于传统协同过滤需要约4000用户评分的性能。

Conclusion: GenZ成功桥接了基础模型和统计建模，通过发现数据集特定语义特征显著提升预测性能，揭示了与模型领域知识不同的特定模式，为可解释AI提供了新途径。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究迭代部署LLM模型（每代使用前代用户精选数据微调）对模型特性的影响，探索这种部署机制如何改变模型能力，特别是对AI安全领域的影响

Method: 在多个规划领域测试迭代部署机制：每代LLM使用前代部署中用户精选数据进行微调，观察模型规划能力的变化，并进行理论分析

Result: 迭代部署显著提升规划技能，后续模型展现出涌现泛化能力，能发现比初始模型长得多的规划方案；理论分析表明这本质上是外层循环的隐式强化学习

Conclusion: 迭代部署机制是隐式强化学习，对AI安全有重要影响（奖励函数未明确定义），可作为显式强化学习的替代训练方案，依赖数据精选而非显式奖励

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.
