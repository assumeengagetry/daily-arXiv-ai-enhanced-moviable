*Akwasi Asare,Ulas Bagci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PolypSeg-GradCAM框架，结合U-Net和Grad-CAM实现可解释的息肉分割，在Kvasir-SEG数据集上取得优异性能（IoU 0.9257），增强了AI辅助结肠镜检查的透明度和可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌是全球主要癌症死因，胃肠道息肉是关键前兆。早期准确分割对预防癌症进展至关重要，但手动分割劳动密集且易受观察者差异影响。现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性，阻碍临床采用

Method: 开发PolypSeg-GradCAM框架，集成U-Net架构和梯度加权类激活映射（Grad-CAM）进行透明息肉分割。在包含1000张标注内窥镜图像的Kvasir-SEG数据集上训练和评估

Result: 实验结果显示强大的分割性能，测试集平均IoU达0.9257，训练和验证集Dice系数（F-score）均高于0.96。Grad-CAM可视化证实预测基于临床相关区域

Conclusion: 通过结合高分割精度和可解释性，PolypSeg-GradCAM向可靠、可信的AI辅助结肠镜检查和改进的早期结直肠癌预防迈出了重要一步

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

*Sherwin Bahmani,Tianchang Shen,Jiawei Ren,Jiahui Huang,Yifeng Jiang,Haithem Turki,Andrea Tagliasacchi,David B. Lindell,Zan Gojcic,Sanja Fidler,Huan Ling,Jun Gao,Xuanchi Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自蒸馏框架，将视频扩散模型中的隐式3D知识蒸馏到显式的3D高斯泼溅表示中，无需多视图训练数据即可生成静态和动态3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的3D重建方法依赖真实世界的多视图数据，而这些数据并不总是容易获取。视频扩散模型具有强大的想象力，但其2D特性限制了在需要与环境交互的模拟应用中的使用。

Method: 在典型的RGB解码器基础上增加3D高斯泼溅解码器，通过RGB解码器的输出进行监督训练。3DGS解码器可以完全使用视频扩散模型生成的合成数据进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架在静态和动态3D场景生成方面达到了最先进的性能，能够从文本提示或单张图像实时合成3D场景。

Conclusion: 提出的自蒸馏框架成功地将视频扩散模型的2D想象力转化为实用的3D表示，为机器人、自动驾驶等物理AI应用提供了有效的3D环境生成解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

### [4] [Self Identity Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18165)
*Xiuding Cai,Yaoyao Zhu,Linjie Fu,Dong Miao,Yu Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Self Identity Mapping (SIM)的新型正则化框架，通过逆向映射机制重构输入来增强表示学习，减少前向传播中的信息损失并促进梯度流动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的正则化技术通常依赖启发式方法，在不同设置下效果不稳定。需要一种更可靠、有效的数据内在正则化方法来提升深度学习的泛化能力。

Method: 提出SIM框架，通过从变换后的输出重构输入来减少信息损失。为降低计算复杂度，开发了ρSIM版本，采用补丁级特征采样和基于投影的方法重构潜在特征。

Result: 在图像分类、少样本提示学习和领域泛化等任务上，ρSIM相比基线方法均取得一致改进。实验证明该方法与现有正则化方法正交，能进一步提升其效果。

Conclusion: SIM作为一种模型无关、任务无关的正则化器，可即插即用，适用于不同网络架构和任务，在密集到密集任务和非视觉领域都表现出色。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

*Zhanting Zhou,Jinbo Wang,Zeqin Wu,Fengli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIA是一种基于动量的自适应梯度反演攻击方法，能够在单轮平均梯度SAG机制下实现高效的多图像重建，无需标签推断且计算开销小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在单轮平均梯度SAG机制下，由于每个样本线索在批次平均梯度中纠缠，导致传统梯度反演方法在大批次场景中重建效果差的问题。

Method: 1. 基于动量的自适应校正框架，通过探测随机数据子集感知潜在的单图像信号；2. 封闭形式的组合重缩放技术，提供更紧的优化边界；3. 动量混合全批次和子集损失，确保重建鲁棒性。

Result: 在大批次场景下显著优于现有先进方法，实现高保真度的多图像重建，且计算开销与标准求解器相当，无需辅助信息。

Conclusion: MAGIA为梯度反演攻击提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在具有挑战性的SAG机制下，展示了强大的重建能力和实用性。

Abstract: We study gradient inversion in the challenging single round averaged gradient
SAG regime where per sample cues are entangled within a single batch mean
gradient. We introduce MAGIA a momentum based adaptive correction on gradient
inversion attack a novel label inference free framework that senses latent per
image signals by probing random data subsets. MAGIA objective integrates two
core innovations 1 a closed form combinatorial rescaling that creates a
provably tighter optimization bound and 2 a momentum based mixing of whole
batch and subset losses to ensure reconstruction robustness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MAGIA significantly outperforms advanced methods
achieving high fidelity multi image reconstruction in large batch scenarios
where prior works fail. This is all accomplished with a computational footprint
comparable to standard solvers and without requiring any auxiliary information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Baseer，一个专门为阿拉伯文档OCR设计的视觉语言模型，通过在大规模合成和真实数据集上微调预训练的MLLM，显著提升了阿拉伯文档OCR的性能，并创建了高质量的评估基准Misraj-DocOCR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯文档OCR面临挑战，包括草书字体、多样化字体、变音符号和从右到左的书写方向。现有的多模态大语言模型在高资源语言上表现良好，但在阿拉伯语上性能有限。

Method: 采用解码器专用的微调策略，在结合合成和真实文档的大规模数据集上微调预训练的MLLM，同时保留通用视觉特征。

Result: Baseer显著优于现有的开源和商业解决方案，实现了0.25的WER，在阿拉伯文档OCR领域建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 领域特定的通用MLLM适应具有显著优势，为形态丰富的语言（如阿拉伯语）的高精度OCR建立了强大的基线。

Abstract: Arabic document OCR remains a challenging task due to the language's cursive
script, diverse fonts, diacritics, and right-to-left orientation. While modern
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced document understanding
for high-resource languages, their performance on Arabic remains limited. In
this work, we introduce Baseer, a vision-language model fine- tuned
specifically for Arabic document OCR. Leveraging a large-scale dataset
combining synthetic and real-world documents, Baseer is trained using a
decoder-only fine-tuning strategy to adapt a pre-trained MLLM while preserving
general visual features. We also present Misraj-DocOCR, a high-quality,
expert-verified benchmark designed for rigorous evaluation of Arabic OCR
systems. Our experiments show that Baseer significantly outperforms existing
open-source and commercial solutions, achieving a WER of 0.25 and establishing
a new state-of-the-art in the domain of Arabic document OCR. Our results
highlight the benefits of domain-specific adaptation of general-purpose MLLMs
and establish a strong baseline for high-accuracy OCR on morphologically rich
languages like Arabic.

### [7] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18176)
*Wendong Yao,Saeed Azadnejad,Binhua Huang,Shane Donohue,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的深度学习框架，将稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据转换为密集的时空张量，首次实现了先进计算机视觉架构在形变预测问题上的直接应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从稀疏的InSAR时间序列数据预测未来地面形变是一个重大挑战，现有方法难以有效处理这种稀疏数据。

Method: 设计并实现了一个混合CNN-LSTM模型，专门用于从生成的时空张量中同时学习空间模式和时间依赖性。

Result: 与LightGBM和LASSO回归等基线模型相比，所提出的架构提供了更准确和空间一致的预测，为该任务建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: 研究结果证实了时空深度学习在高分辨率形变预测中的有效性和潜力，基线模型往往默认使用简单的持续性模式，凸显了集成时空方法的必要性。

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

### [8] [A Framework for Generating Artificial Datasets to Validate Absolute and Relative Position Concepts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18177)
*George Corrêa de Araújo,Helena de Almeida Maia,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scrapbook框架是一种生成大规模数据集的新方法，用于探究AI模型学习到的概念，重点关注物体识别、位置关系和属性识别等基础概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI模型在理解基础概念方面存在不足，需要系统性的评估方法来验证模型对基本元素的理解，然后再处理更复杂的任务。

Method: 通过生成包含大量关于单个概念的问题和广泛语言变体的数据集，来评估模型对基础概念的理解能力。

Result: 实验显示当代模型在物体识别方面表现良好，但在理解位置信息和处理有额外约束的问题时存在困难。MobileVLM-V2模型显示出显著的答案不一致性，其他模型则表现出对肯定答案的偏见，在几何形状和位置信息问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Scrapbook框架为生成多样化数据集提供了有价值的工具，可用于系统评估和提升AI模型的性能，特别是在基础概念理解方面。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

### [9] [The Describe-Then-Generate Bottleneck: How VLM Descriptions Alter Image Generation Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18179)
*Sai Varun Kodathala,Rakesh Vunnam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过实证分析量化了视觉-语言-视觉管道中描述-生成瓶颈造成的信息损失，发现99.3%的样本存在显著感知退化，91.5%存在结构信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态AI系统在创意工作流中的集成日益增多，理解视觉-语言-视觉管道中的信息损失对于评估系统局限性变得重要，但目前通过文本中介传递视觉内容时的退化程度仍缺乏量化研究。

Method: 生成了150对通过描述-生成管道的图像对，应用现有指标（LPIPS、SSIM和颜色距离）来测量感知、结构和色彩维度上的信息保存情况。

Result: 评估显示99.3%的样本表现出显著的感知退化，91.5%的样本表现出显著的结构信息损失。

Conclusion: 描述-生成瓶颈代表了当代多模态系统中可测量且一致的限制，为系统改进提供了实证依据。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of multimodal AI systems in creative
workflows, understanding information loss in vision-language-vision pipelines
has become important for evaluating system limitations. However, the
degradation that occurs when visual content passes through textual
intermediation remains poorly quantified. In this work, we provide empirical
analysis of the describe-then-generate bottleneck, where natural language
serves as an intermediate representation for visual information. We generated
150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种AI驱动的工作流程，利用高分辨率卫星影像自动推断屋顶属性，以解决小岛屿发展中国家建筑结构信息缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多气候脆弱地区的小岛屿发展中国家缺乏详细的建筑结构信息，这限制了城市韧性规划和灾害风险评估的能力。

Method: 比较了地理空间基础模型结合浅层分类器与微调深度学习模型在屋顶分类中的效果，并评估了整合邻国训练数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在屋顶坡度和屋顶材料分类上分别达到了0.88和0.83的F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合本地能力建设，该研究旨在为小岛屿发展中国家提供利用AI和地球观测数据进行高效、基于证据的城市治理的新能力。

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了VLA-LPAF轻量级模块来解决VLA模型在多视角视觉观察中的视角异构性问题，通过在潜在空间融合多视角观察来提升模型的视角适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在处理来自不同环境和视角的视觉观察时存在视角异构性问题，这限制了模型的通用性。不同视角的视觉特征差异显著影响了模型的性能。

Method: 提出VLA-LPAF轻量级模块，使用单视角图像进行微调，在潜在空间融合多视角观察，有效弥合视角不一致带来的差距。基于RoboFlamingo模型构建了RoboFlamingo-LPAF框架。

Result: 实验显示RoboFlamingo-LPAF在CALVIN数据集上平均提升约8%的任务成功率，在LIBERO上提升15%，在定制仿真基准上提升30%。真实世界任务也验证了其视角自适应特性。

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF能够有效提升VLA模型在多视角环境中的适应性和性能，为解决视角异构性问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

Extensive experiments on the DSEC dataset demonstrate that URNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,
driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video
synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and
semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour
classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing
real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global
landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context
aware intelligent transportation solutions.

TL;DR: HazeFlow是一个基于ODE的新框架，将大气散射模型重新表述为常微分方程，通过单步推理实现真实世界图像去雾，并引入基于马尔可夫链布朗运动的非均匀雾霾生成方法来解决训练数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法缺乏配对的真实世界训练数据，导致泛化能力不足；传统基于大气散射模型的方法难以处理真实世界的复杂雾霾模式。

Method: 将大气散射模型重新表述为ODE，学习从雾霾图像到清晰图像的最优ODE轨迹；使用马尔可夫链布朗运动生成非均匀雾霾数据来增强训练。

Result: 在多个真实世界去雾基准数据集上达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HazeFlow通过ODE框架和创新的雾霾生成方法，有效解决了真实世界图像去雾的挑战。

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学诊断越来越多地使用多模态数据，但现有模型难以有效融合异构信息并处理模态缺失问题，需要开发更鲁棒的多模态学习方法。

Method: 引入可学习的模态token来改进缺失感知的模态融合，将传统的单模态对比目标与融合的多模态表示相结合，使用增强的模态dropout策略。

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens
for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional
unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We
validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection
and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了9种分割架构在肺栓塞分割任务中的表现，发现3D U-Net ResNet是最佳架构，CNN模型优于ViT模型，分类预训练反而有害，远端栓塞分割仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺栓塞分割是临床诊断的重要任务，但缺乏对不同分割架构在统一框架下的系统性评估。本研究旨在填补这一空白，为肺栓塞分割提供性能基准和实用指导。

Method: 使用490个CTPA扫描构建内部数据集，在统一测试框架下评估9种CNN和ViT分割架构，比较预训练和随机初始化的效果。

Result: 最佳模型达到0.7131的Dice分数，在60个测试扫描中检测到181个栓塞，49个假阳性，28个假阴性。3D CNN模型表现优于ViT模型，分类预训练反而降低分割性能。

Conclusion: 3D U-Net ResNet是肺栓塞分割的有效架构，远端栓塞分割仍是挑战，不同模型在相同数据上表现一致，分类和分割任务依赖不同特征。

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

Motivation: 手形在手语中具有基础音系学作用，但计算方法很少显式建模手形，限制了识别准确性和语言分析。

Method: 结合解剖学信息图结构和对比学习的新型图神经网络，分离时间动态和静态手形配置。

Result: 在签名序列中建立了首个结构化手形识别基准，在37个手形类别上达到46%准确率（基线方法为25%）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决手形识别中的关键挑战，包括细微的类间差异和时间变化。

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with
American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes.
However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting
both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph
neural network that separates temporal dynamics from static handshape
configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures
with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition,
including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish
the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences,
achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods
achieving 25%).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了分类任务选择对胎儿超声图像中分布外检测性能的影响，发现最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准类型（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移），且OOD检测性能与弃权预测性能不一定相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注不确定性量化方法，但忽视了分类任务本身对OOD检测的影响。在胎儿超声图像存在异质性和不同临床设置的背景下，可靠的OOD检测对深度学习模型的安全部署至关重要。

Method: 在四个分类任务上实验了八种不确定性量化方法，分析不同任务对OOD检测性能的影响，特别关注图像特征偏移和解剖特征偏移两种ID-OOD标准。

Result: OOD检测性能随任务显著变化，最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准类型。图像特征偏移和解剖特征偏移需要不同的任务选择策略。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，需要根据具体下游应用来协调任务选择和不确定性策略，因为优异的OOD检测性能并不保证最佳的弃权预测效果。

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了OrthoLoC数据集，这是首个大规模无人机图像与正射地理数据配对的基准数据集，用于解决在资源受限环境下的高精度视觉定位问题，并提出了AdHoP改进技术显著提升匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机应用中，许多场景需要在没有互联网或GPS支持的情况下实现高精度定位，但现有方法依赖大型图像数据库或重型3D模型，不适用于资源受限环境。正射地理数据轻量且易得，但缺乏相关研究。

Method: 创建包含16,425张无人机图像的多模态数据集，解决无人机图像与地理数据之间的域偏移问题。数据集采用配对结构，将图像检索与特征匹配解耦，并提出了AdHoP改进技术，可与任何特征匹配器集成。

Result: 通过全面评估分析了域偏移、数据分辨率和共视性对定位精度的影响。AdHoP技术将匹配性能提升高达95%，平移误差降低高达63%。

Conclusion: OrthoLoC数据集为基于正射地理数据的视觉定位提供了公平的基准测试平台，AdHoP技术显著改善了特征匹配性能，为资源受限环境下的高精度定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSDnet的单图像异常定位方法，无需训练数据或参考样本，利用卷积神经网络的归纳偏置进行零样本异常检测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实场景中训练数据不可用、只有测试图像本身可用的零样本异常检测问题

Method: 基于Deep Image Prior思想，设计基于patch的训练框架，通过掩码、patch打乱和小高斯噪声避免恒等映射，使用基于内积相似度的感知损失

Result: 在MVTec-AD上达到0.99 AUROC和0.60 AUPRC，在fabric数据集上达到0.98 AUROC和0.67 AUPRC，优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: SSDnet无需外部训练数据、标签或参考样本，在存在噪声或缺失像素的情况下保持鲁棒性，是有效的零样本异常检测方法

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对低资源孟加拉语的视觉-语言模型，通过三重损失函数（PAL+InfoNCE+OT）改善图像与文本的对齐，显著提升了孟加拉语图像描述任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如孟加拉语）在视觉-语言模型中面临的挑战，包括配对数据稀缺、翻译对齐问题以及英语中心预训练导致的语义忽略。

Method: 使用LaBSE验证的英-孟配对数据和11万张双语提示生成的合成图像训练模型。采用冻结的MaxViT提取视觉特征，孟加拉语原生mBART-50解码，轻量级桥接模块连接模态。核心创新是三重损失函数：PAL对齐真实和合成图像的补丁描述符，InfoNCE强制全局分离，Sinkhorn-based OT确保细粒度补丁对应。

Result: 在Flickr30k-1k和MSCOCO-1k数据集上取得显著提升（BLEU-4分别达12.29和12.00，METEOR分别达27.98和28.14，BERTScore-F1分别达71.20和75.40），优于强基线方法，并将真实-合成图像中心差距缩小41%。

Conclusion: 提出的三重损失函数方法有效改善了低资源语言的视觉-语言对齐问题，为其他低资源语言提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the

Motivation: 解决现有高效摄像头基线模型功能不完整的问题，将大规模多模态感知规划模型的能力迁移到资源受限的实时自动驾驶系统中。

Method: 采用模型无关的多阶段蒸馏策略，结合特征级、输出级和自适应区域感知监督，将高容量多模态知识转移到轻量级BEV表示中。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，检测mAP达到39.0，运动预测minADE为1.08，碰撞率0.32，运行速度提升5倍（11 FPS），仅需摄像头输入。

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的运动模糊球体标注策略，将球标注在模糊条纹中心而非传统的前缘位置，并开发了BlurBall模型联合估计球位置和运动模糊属性，在乒乓球检测中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注方法将球标记在模糊前缘，导致不对称性并忽略了与速度相关的运动线索。运动模糊降低了快速移动物体的清晰度，特别是在球拍运动中，球往往呈现为条纹而非清晰点。

Method: 引入新的标注策略将球置于模糊条纹中心并显式标注模糊属性；开发BlurBall模型，通过注意力机制（如多帧输入的Squeeze-and-Excitation）联合估计球位置和运动模糊属性。

Result: 新的标注方法在各种模型上一致提高了检测性能；BlurBall模型在球检测方面达到了最先进的结果；利用模糊信息不仅提高了检测精度，还实现了更可靠的轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 所提出的标注策略和BlurBall模型有效利用了运动模糊信息，显著提升了球体检测性能，对实时体育分析具有重要价值。

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

Conclusion: 简单的预处理技术可以有效增强现有光照估计模型的颜色准确性，该方法具有通用性且无需重新训练模型，为提升AR应用的真实感提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支票在金融交易中广泛使用但易受欺诈，传统检测方法依赖大量标注数据，而这类数据因隐私和专有性问题难以获取

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和多模态大语言模型(MLLM)，开发免训练框架进行支票字段的零样本检测，包括签名、MICR线、金额等关键字段

Result: 在包含110张不同格式支票的手工数据集上评估，表现出强大的性能和泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架不仅能实现零样本支票字段检测，还可作为生成高质量标注数据的引导机制，为开发定制化的实时目标检测模型奠定基础

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型在图表理解中的表现，发现模型在面对噪声、遮挡等失真情况时性能显著下降，并出现幻觉现象。作者提出了CHART NOISe数据集来测试模型在失真条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图表理解基准假设图表是干净的且查询是基于事实的，但现实世界中的图表往往包含失真，需要超越简单匹配的推理能力。当前模型在这些挑战性场景下的表现尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 作者评估了ChatGPT 4o、Claude Sonnet 4和Gemini 2.5 Pro等先进视觉语言模型，并引入了CHART NOISe数据集，该数据集结合了图表失真、遮挡和基于韩国CSAT英语部分的多选题。关键创新是提示反向不一致性测试。

Result: 研究发现模型在失真或遮挡条件下性能急剧下降，幻觉现象（如数值捏造、趋势误解和实体混淆）更加频繁。模型在退化设置中仍然过度自信，生成看似合理但缺乏支持的解释。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图表理解的鲁棒性和可靠性建立了严格的测试基准，揭示了视觉语言模型在图表推理中的系统性脆弱性，并提出了质量过滤和遮挡检测等基线缓解策略。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统4D-MRI重建方法（如相位分箱）存在无法捕捉时间变异性、工作流程复杂、计算负载重等问题，需要一种更高效准确的方法来捕捉呼吸运动。

Method: 使用两个协同网络：空间解剖网络（SAN）编码连续3D解剖表示，时序运动网络（TMN）基于Transformer生成的呼吸信号产生时间一致的变形场。

Result: 在19名志愿者的自由呼吸数据集上验证，该方法能准确捕捉规则和不规则呼吸模式，保持血管和支气管连续性，处理时间从5小时减少到15分钟，单个体积推断时间小于1秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在4D放射治疗规划和实时自适应治疗中具有强大应用潜力，相比传统方法具有显著优势。

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在快速移动小物体（如壁球）跟踪中的性能，发现DeepOCSORT在跟踪精度上表现最佳，但所有方法都存在显著的跟踪漂移问题，表明当前方法在处理快速移动小物体的不可预测运动模式方面存在根本性局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速移动小物体（如壁球）的不可预测运动模式和小尺寸视觉标记使得精确跟踪成为计算机视觉中的挑战性问题，特别是在体育机器人应用中，轻量级且准确的跟踪系统可以改善机器人感知和规划能力。

Method: 使用包含10,000个标注壁球帧的自定义数据集，评估了五种最先进的卡尔曼滤波跟踪方法（OCSORT、DeepOCSORT、ByteTrack、BoTSORT和StrongSORT），重点分析了推理速度和每图像更新频率这两个关键性能因素。

Result: DeepOCSORT实现了最低的跟踪误差（平均ADE为31.15像素），而ByteTrack处理速度最快（平均推理时间26.6ms）。但所有跟踪器都表现出显著的跟踪漂移，空间误差范围为3-11cm（ADE值：31-114像素）。

Conclusion: 当前跟踪方法的误差率比标准物体跟踪基准高3-4倍，表明需要专门的方法来处理快速移动小物体跟踪应用。

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

Motivation: 为了解决视频动作识别中计算效率低的问题，利用H.264视频中已有的运动向量来定位运动密集区域，实现高效的动作识别

Method: 采用轻量级管道，包括去噪与合并(DM)、蒙特卡洛采样(MCS)和通过运动密度子矩阵搜索的自适应裁剪(AC)，生成鲁棒的裁剪区域

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，MoCrop在相同FLOPs下提升Top-1准确率3.5%，或在减少26.5%FLOPs的同时提升准确率2.4%；在CoViAR上达到89.2%准确率

Conclusion: MoCrop具有强泛化性，适用于多种骨干网络，为压缩域实时部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B
indicate strong generality and make MoCrop practical for real-time deployment
in the compressed domain. Our code and models are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在低比特率条件下性能不佳，要么保留过多冗余细节，要么学习过度集中的符号分布

Method: 使用代码本和向量量化将连续视觉特征映射为离散索引，选择性传输到云端，保留更多信息性视觉模式

Result: 在码率和准确率方面表现出优越性，对低比特率条件更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: CAFC-SE框架在边缘-云系统中实现了有效的特征压缩和语义分析性能

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中现有方法计算复杂度高、参数量大，难以在资源受限环境（如床边设备）部署的问题

Method: 设计了多核深度卷积块（MKDC）处理多分辨率空间关系，结合通道、空间和分组门控注意力机制突出图像显著特征

Conclusion: MK-UNet在计算效率和分割精度上取得突破性进展，为资源受限环境下的实时高保真医学诊断提供了无与伦比的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with
4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent
lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with
much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with
drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for
real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such
as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at

parametrizing each Gaussian relative to its parent mesh triangle, we enforce

propagated back to update the CT. We demonstrate BridgeSplat's effectiveness on
visceral pig surgeries and synthetic data of a human liver under simulation,
showing sensible deformations of the preoperative CT on monocular RGB data.

Conclusion: DGLE框架通过扩散模型引导的标签增强策略，显著提升了目标域模型的性能

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种几何感知的两阶段框架GeoRemover，用于智能图像编辑中的物体移除，不仅移除目标物体，还消除其因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射），解决了现有方法在可控性和伪影处理方面的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有图像外观方法要么严格遵循掩码对齐训练但无法移除未明确掩码的因果效应，要么采用松散掩码对齐策略但缺乏可控性且可能过度擦除其他物体。这些限制源于忽略了物体几何存在与其视觉效应之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）几何移除阶段，使用严格掩码对齐监督直接从几何（如深度）中移除物体；2）外观渲染阶段，基于更新后的几何条件渲染真实感RGB图像。引入基于正负样本对的偏好驱动目标来指导几何移除学习。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试上的大量实验表明，该方法在移除物体及其相关伪影方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GeoRemover通过几何感知方法有效解决了物体移除中的因果伪影问题，实现了更好的可控性和编辑质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at

Method: SEGA方法通过高斯平滑源模型并集成其平滑梯度来近似目标模型的梯度，同时使用专门设计的扰动过滤掩码来确保对抗扰动的不可感知性。

Result: 在CLIVE数据集上的实验结果表明，SEGA具有优越的可迁移性，能够成功实现对NR-IQA模型的基于迁移的黑盒攻击。

Conclusion: SEGA是首个有效解决NR-IQA模型攻击可迁移性低问题的方法，为揭示模型脆弱性和指导鲁棒系统设计提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

*Mohammad Junayed Hasan,Nabeel Mohammed,Shafin Rahman,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出HadaSmileNet，一种新颖的特征融合框架，通过参数免费的乘法交互直接整合基于transformer的表征与生理基础的D-Markers，在微笑表情识别任务中实现了最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多任务学习框架在结合深度学习架构与手工D-Marker特征时存在计算效率低下的问题，需要辅助任务监督和复杂的损失平衡

Method: 采用Hadamard乘法融合策略，系统评估15种融合方法，直接集成transformer表征与D-Markers特征，无需参数学习

Result: 在四个基准数据集上取得最优结果：UvA-NEMO (88.7%, +0.8)、MMI (99.7%)、SPOS (98.5%, +0.7)、BBC (100%, +5.0)，参数减少26%且训练简化

Conclusion: 该框架通过直接领域知识整合增强了判别能力，其效率和有效性使其特别适合需要实时情感计算能力的多媒体数据挖掘应用

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

*Xiaoting Yin,Hao Shi,Kailun Yang,Jiajun Zhai,Shangwei Guo,Lin Wang,Kaiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和3D高斯泼溅的单目视频动态人体与静态场景联合重建框架，通过事件引导的损失函数解决快速运动中的模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频重建动态人体和静态场景存在困难，特别是在快速运动时RGB帧会出现运动模糊。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率的优势，更适合动态人体重建。

Method: 使用统一的3D高斯集合，其中包含可学习的语义属性；只有被分类为人体的高斯会进行形变动画，场景高斯保持静态。提出事件引导损失函数，匹配连续渲染之间的模拟亮度变化与事件流。

Result: 在两个基准数据集ZJU-MoCap-Blur和MMHPSD-Blur上实现了最先进的人体-场景重建效果，在PSNR/SSIM指标上显著优于强基线，LPIPS降低，特别是对高速运动对象。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部人体掩码，简化了单独高斯集的管理，通过事件引导有效提升了快速运动区域的局部保真度。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

TL;DR: Live-E2T是一个实时威胁监控框架，通过结构化语义元组、在线事件去重和基于LLM的逻辑推理，同时实现高性能威胁检测和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足实时性能和决策可解释性的要求，需要一种统一框架来解决这一挑战

Method: 1）将视频帧解构为结构化的人-物-交互-地点语义元组；2）提出高效的在线事件去重和更新机制；3）使用思维链策略微调大语言模型进行透明推理

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准数据集上的实验表明，Live-E2T在威胁检测准确性、实时效率和可解释性方面显著优于最先进方法

Conclusion: Live-E2T成功统一了实时性能和可解释性目标，为实时威胁监控提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对多模态大语言模型美学理解能力的新方法，包括PhotoCritique数据集、PhotoEye模型和PhotoBench基准测试，旨在解决传统视觉理解与美学视觉理解之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态大语言模型在美学视觉理解方面存在局限，无法像专业摄影师那样从美学角度（如色彩、光线、构图）分析图像，而仅限于一般性的物体识别和定位。

Method: 首先构建了基于专业摄影师讨论的大规模PhotoCritique数据集；然后提出了PhotoEye模型，采用语言引导的多视角视觉融合机制；最后建立了全面的PhotoBench基准测试。

Result: 在现有基准测试和PhotoBench上，该模型相比现有模型展现出明显优势，能够提供更专业的美学分析和描述。

Conclusion: 通过专业数据集、创新模型和全面基准测试的组合，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的美学视觉理解能力，填补了普通视觉理解与专业美学理解之间的重要空白。

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Result: 由于实验记录丢失，无法报告精确定量结果，但初步开发印象显示XMem框架具有合理的分割性能并满足临床实时要求。

Conclusion: 该工作为MRI引导放疗中的肿瘤跟踪精度提升做出了贡献，尽管缺乏详细实验结果，但展示了在挑战性条件下的应用潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time
MRI-guided radiotherapy, designed for the TrackRAD2025 challenge. Our method
leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors
across long cine-MRI sequences. The proposed system efficiently integrates
memory mechanisms to track tumor motion in real-time, achieving high
segmentation accuracy even under challenging conditions with limited annotated
data. Unfortunately, the detailed experimental records have been lost,
preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSCM模型解决多对比度MRI超分辨率问题，通过动态空间扭曲、语义感知令牌聚合和空间-频率融合模块，实现空间语义一致性重建


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在空间语义一致性建模不足，且未充分利用频域信息，导致细粒度对齐差和高频细节恢复不足

Method: SSCM模型包含三个核心模块：动态空间扭曲模块用于跨对比度空间对齐，语义感知令牌聚合块用于长程语义一致性，空间-频率融合块用于精细结构恢复

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上的实验表明，SSCM以更少的参数实现了最先进的性能，确保空间和语义一致的重建

Conclusion: SSCM模型有效解决了多对比度MRI超分辨率中的空间语义一致性问题，在保持解剖结构对齐的同时提升了重建质量

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有放射学报告生成方法对大规模数据和计算资源的高度依赖问题，在预算受限条件下实现高效训练。

Method: 结合OraPO（将失败的GRPO探索转化为偏好监督）和FactS（基于临床事实提取和蕴含检查的奖励机制），实现单阶段强化学习训练。

Result: 在CheXpert Plus数据集上达到0.341 F1分数，使用小规模基础视觉语言模型和少量训练数据（减少2-3个数量级）。

Conclusion: 该方法创建了一个紧凑而强大的框架，显著提高了临床挑战性案例的学习效率，为资源受限环境下的放射学报告生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AMSF是一个基于参考图像的免训练框架，能够在扩散模型中实现可控的多参考风格融合，解决了现有方法只能处理单一风格图像和缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的方法存在两个主要限制：(a)只能接受一个风格图像，无法实现混合美学和扩展到更多风格；(b)缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制。AMSF旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过语义标记分解模块编码所有风格图像和文本提示，自适应地注入到冻结扩散模型的每个交叉注意力层中。相似性感知重加权模块在每个去噪步骤重新校准分配给每个风格组件的注意力。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示，AMSF生成的多风格融合结果始终优于最先进的方法，且其融合设计可无缝扩展到两个或更多风格。

Conclusion: AMSF是扩散模型中实现表达性多风格生成的实用步骤，无需微调或外部适配器即可产生平衡且用户可控的融合效果。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLF-4DRCNet是一个用于3D目标检测的两阶段框架，通过4D雷达和相机图像的多级融合来解决现有方法忽略雷达点云稀疏性和不完整几何结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达在自动驾驶中具有成本效益和鲁棒性，但其点云存在显著稀疏性和噪声，限制了在3D目标检测中的独立应用。现有雷达-相机融合方法大多采用为LiDAR-相机融合设计的BEV范式，忽视了雷达的固有缺陷。

Method: 提出包含三个关键组件的两阶段框架：增强雷达点编码器（ERPE）模块通过三重注意力体素特征编码器将雷达点云与2D图像实例密集化并编码为体素；分层场景融合池化（HSFP）模块使用可变形注意力动态集成多尺度体素特征与2D图像特征；提议级融合增强（PLFE）模块通过融合图像特征精炼区域提议。

Result: 在View-of-Delft（VoD）和TJ4DRadSet数据集上的实验结果表明，MLF-4DRCNet达到了最先进的性能，在VoD数据集上实现了与基于LiDAR的模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MLF-4DRCNet通过点级、场景级和提议级的多模态信息融合，实现了全面的特征表示，有效解决了4D雷达点云稀疏性和噪声问题，为自动驾驶感知提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

TL;DR: PDLS是一个无需训练的框架，通过双流潜在空间引导解决扩散模型图像重建中的语义漂移问题，在保持结构完整性的同时提升语义准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单潜在向量的图像重建方法难以平衡结构保真度和语义准确性，导致重建图像出现语义漂移问题，如细节模糊或属性错误。

Method: 提出Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering (PDLS)框架，将重建过程分解为结构路径和语义路径，通过线性二次调节器(LQR)实现动态轨迹控制。

Result: 在FFHQ-1K和ImageNet-1K数据集上的实验表明，PDLS在各种重建任务中均优于单潜在基线方法，能生成更忠实于原图且语义对齐的重建结果。

Conclusion: PDLS通过双流潜在引导机制有效解决了扩散模型图像重建中的语义漂移问题，无需逐图像优化即可实现高质量重建。

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

Motivation: 全球MRI需求增长给医疗系统带来压力，延长周转时间并加剧医生倦怠，特别是在资源匮乏和农村地区。

Method: 使用大型学术医疗系统作为数据引擎，训练基于分层视觉架构的VLM模型，支持真实临床MRI研究输入。

Conclusion: Prima展示了健康系统规模VLM的变革潜力，有助于减轻医疗系统偏见，推进AI驱动的医疗保健。

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

Conclusion: UiG框架成功地将理解能力整合到生成过程中，有效缓解了生成能力的局限性，为统一模型的推理提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in
the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in
particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and
trained weights are available at https://github.com/TouchSurgery/EndoSynth.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，通过局部强调状态空间模块和自适应融合模块解决RGB-D显著目标检测中局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分的问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D显著目标检测方法存在局限性：CNN受限于局部感受野，Vision Transformers存在二次复杂度问题。状态空间模型虽能线性复杂度建模长程依赖，但直接应用于RGB-D SOD会导致局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分。

Method: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，包含两个核心组件：1）局部强调状态空间模块（LE-SSM）捕获多尺度局部依赖；2）基于SSM的自适应融合模块（AFM）实现互补的跨模态交互和可靠的跨模态集成。

Result: 在16个最先进的RGB-D SOD方法中，LEAF-Mamba在效能和效率上均表现最优。在RGB-T SOD任务上也展现出优异的性能，证明其强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba模型成功解决了RGB-D SOD中的关键挑战，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，并展现出良好的跨任务泛化能力。

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

*Xinle Gao,Linghui Ye,Zhiyong Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级食品图像分类算法，结合窗口多头注意力机制和空间注意力机制，在降低计算复杂度的同时保持高分类精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品行业对生产质量和效率要求不断提高，但Vision Transformer模型参数多、计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限环境中部署

Method: 集成窗口多头注意力机制（WMHAM）和空间注意力机制（SAM），WMHAM通过窗口划分捕获局部和全局上下文特征以降低计算成本，SAM自适应强调关键空间区域以改进判别性特征表示

Result: 在Food-101和Vireo Food-172数据集上分别达到95.24%和94.33%的准确率，同时显著减少了参数和FLOPs

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和分类性能之间实现了有效平衡，适合在资源受限环境中部署

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

TL;DR: OSDA是一个用于遥感图像开放集土地覆盖分析的三阶段框架，能够实现无标注的发现、分割和描述，结合像素级精度和高级语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像中开放集土地覆盖分析的需求，需要同时实现精细空间定位和语义开放分类，既要检测和分割无类别监督的新对象，又要通过多模态推理为其分配可解释的语义标签。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）使用可提示的微调分割模型（SAM）进行精确发现和掩码提取；2）通过两阶段微调的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）进行语义归因和上下文描述；3）使用LLM作为评判者和人工评分进行MLLM评估。

Result: 该框架在多样化卫星图像上支持鲁棒评估，无需人工标注，为动态土地覆盖监测提供了可扩展和可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: OSDA展示了在自动制图更新和大规模地球观测分析方面的强大潜力，为开放世界遥感解释提供了架构无关和无标签的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

TL;DR: LifeCLEF 2021植物识别挑战旨在评估如何利用植物标本馆藏品改进生物多样性丰富但数据贫乏地区（如圭亚那地盾）的植物自动识别，通过跨域分类任务结合标本馆样本和少量野外照片进行训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前植物自动识别主要基于北美和西欧的数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据稀缺。植物标本馆收藏了大量热带植物标本，可用于弥补这一数据缺口。

Method: 使用约1000种圭亚那地盾植物的数据集，训练集包含数十万标本馆样本和数千张野外照片，采用跨域分类方法学习两个域之间的对应关系，并利用5种形态和功能性状数据。

Result: 挑战评估了不同研究团队的方法和系统，测试集仅包含野外照片，评估了模型在数据贫乏地区的识别性能。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆藏品可以有效改进热带地区植物自动识别，跨域学习方法为解决数据不平衡问题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides
an analysis of the main results.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了AGSwap方法来解决跨类别对象融合问题，并引入了COF数据集作为基准测试工具。AGSwap通过组嵌入交换和自适应组更新机制实现语义一致的对象融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法在跨类别对象融合时存在偏差、视觉混乱和语义不一致的问题，且缺乏全面的基准数据集。

Method: AGSwap方法包含两个关键组件：组嵌入交换（融合不同概念的语义属性）和自适应组更新（基于平衡评估分数的动态优化机制）。同时构建了COF数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，AGSwap在简单和复杂提示下都优于现有的组合式T2I方法，包括GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: AGSwap是一种简单而高效的跨类别对象融合方法，COF数据集为该领域提供了重要的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSVG-ZeroOV是一个无需训练的零样本开放词汇遥感视觉定位框架，利用冻结的通用基础模型实现开放场景下的目标定位


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于封闭词汇表，而基于基础模型的方法需要昂贵数据集和耗时微调，需要解决这些限制

Method: 三阶段框架：Overview（VLM获取跨注意力图）- Focus（扩散模型补充结构信息）- Evolve（注意力进化模块净化分割掩码）

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架始终优于现有的弱监督和零样本方法

Conclusion: RSVG-ZeroOV提供了一个无需特定任务训练的高效可扩展解决方案

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

*Yingquan Wang,Pingping Zhang,Chong Sun,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种属性提示组合（APC）框架，通过文本语义联合增强目标重识别（ReID）的判别性和泛化性，解决了现有模型在单域和跨域场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID模型要么局限于单域场景容易过拟合，要么在跨域场景中依赖归一化策略可能抑制身份特异性判别线索。需要一种能够同时增强判别性和泛化性的方法。

Method: 提出APC框架，包含属性提示生成器（APG）和快慢训练策略（FSTS）。APG通过语义属性字典（SAD）和提示组合模块（PCM）生成判别性属性感知特征；FSTS通过快速更新流（FUS）和慢速更新流（SUS）平衡ReID特异性判别和通用表示学习。

Result: 在传统和领域泛化（DG）ReID数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在判别性和泛化性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: APC框架通过利用文本语义和视觉语言模型的泛化能力，有效解决了ReID中的判别性和泛化性平衡问题，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The
source code is available at https://github.com/AWangYQ/APC.

TL;DR: OTCCLIP是一个基于最优传输理论的框架，用于重建图像-文本对，以防御CLIP模型的数据投毒和后门攻击。该方法通过细粒度视觉和文本特征的最优传输距离来重新分配标题，并利用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的防御方法仅依赖图像和标题的全局表示来匹配新标题，忽视了细粒度特征，可能引入错误的图像-文本对并损害CLIP预训练。

Method: 提出基于最优传输的细粒度视觉和文本特征集距离度量，根据最优传输距离重新分配标题，并使用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐。

Result: OTCCLIP成功降低了投毒攻击的攻击成功率，与之前的方法相比，显著提高了在投毒数据集上训练的CLIP的零样本和线性探测性能。

Conclusion: OTCCLIP通过最优传输方法有效解决了CLIP模型的数据投毒防御问题，在保持模型性能的同时提高了安全性。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型主要采用结果导向范式，忽视了视觉语言模型中编码的交互过程，这种表示差异阻碍了有效的知识迁移和跨视觉任务的泛化能力。

Method: LFI框架包含两个技术创新：交互查询（维护跨网络层的持久关系结构）和基于交互的监督（源自视觉语言模型的跨模态注意力机制）。

Result: 在TinyImageNet分类上提升3.3mAP，COCO检测/分割分别提升1.6mAP/2.4AP，在PACS和VLCS的跨域设置中分别实现2.4和9.3的零样本改进，人类评估显示语义一致性指标比结果导向方法高2.7倍。

Conclusion: LFI框架通过建模交互过程实现了更忠实和高效的知识迁移，在参数开销最小化和收敛速度更快的情况下，显著提升了视觉基础模型的性能，特别是在跨域场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到最先进性能，具有显著通用性，可与其他RGB-T SOD方法无缝集成

Conclusion: HyPSAM展示了提示工程在RGB-T SOD领域的潜力，为多模态显著目标检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云易受噪声、遮挡和对抗性破坏影响，现有自编码器在真实场景下性能下降，需要更鲁棒的多模态融合方法。

Method: 使用多模态交叉注意力机制，对齐文本语义线索、图像几何特征和LiDAR空间结构，实现联合表示学习。

Result: 在强对抗攻击和重噪声条件下显著优于CNN自编码器，在nuScenes-mini数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架是模型无关的，可与任何CNN点云自编码器集成，提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

Method: 结合DAPO和GSPO目标与针对工具使用的奖励方案，优化Reflect-Call-Final的逐步策略，并引入Tool-Reflection-Bench基准程序化检查结构有效性、可执行性、参数正确性和结果一致性。

Result: 在BFCL v3和Tool-Reflection-Bench上的实验显示，多轮工具调用成功率和错误恢复能力显著提升，冗余调用减少。

Conclusion: 将反思明确化并直接优化可提高工具交互的可靠性，为智能体从失败中学习提供可复现的路径。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

TL;DR: 本文提出COLT方法，通过可学习的工具代码本增强开源视频大语言模型的持续工具使用能力，解决现有方法在动态工具环境中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM工具使用方法假设工具库固定，无法适应现实世界中工具数据持续演化和流式输入的环境。

Method: COLT方法包含可学习的工具代码本作为工具特定记忆系统，根据用户指令与工具特征的相似度动态选择相关工具，并收集了视频中心工具使用指令调优数据集VideoToolBench。

Result: 在视频LLM基准测试和工具使用专用数据集VideoToolBench上的广泛实验表明，COLT方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: COLT方法成功增强了开源视频LLMs的持续工具使用能力，在动态工具环境中表现出色。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基准测试主要关注室内场景或短距离户外活动，缺乏对长距离旅行挑战的探索，而掌握扩展的地理时空轨迹对于下一代MLLMs在具身AI规划和导航等实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 构建包含200个旅行视频的VIR-Bench基准，将行程重建作为核心任务来评估MLLMs的地理时空智能。

Result: 实验结果显示，包括专有模型在内的最先进MLLMs都难以获得高分，表明处理跨越扩展空间和时间尺度的视频具有挑战性。

Conclusion: VIR-Bench不仅能有效评估模型性能，其评估方法还能转化为用户端应用中的具体性能提升，通过开发的旅行规划代理验证了这一点。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FixingGS是一种无需训练的方法，利用现有扩散模型增强稀疏视角3D高斯溅射重建，通过改进的蒸馏方法提供准确且跨视图一致的扩散先验，实现有效的伪影去除和修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视角下的3D场景重建存在视觉信息不足的问题，导致3D表示中出现明显伪影。现有方法虽然使用生成先验去除伪影，但难以保证多视图一致性，导致结构模糊和细节不真实。

Method: 提出FixingGS方法，包括：1）蒸馏方法提供准确且跨视图一致的扩散先验；2）自适应渐进增强方案进一步细化欠约束区域的重建。

Result: 大量实验表明，FixingGS在视觉质量和重建性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FixingGS通过充分利用扩散模型能力，有效解决了稀疏视角3DGS重建中的伪影和多视图一致性问题，取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually
adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our
dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with
varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical
information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No

Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers
in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These
findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex
visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for
benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications
where accuracy is critical.

TL;DR: Bi-VLM提出了一种基于高斯分位数的非均匀权重分离方法，通过显著性感知混合量化算法对视觉语言模型进行超低比特（≤2位）量化，显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的计算需求和内存要求过高，限制了其在硬件受限环境中的应用，需要解决计算效率与超低比特精度之间的关键差距。

Method: 基于高斯分位数非均匀分离模型权重，将权重分为异常值（显著）和多个正常值（非显著）子集，提出显著性感知混合量化算法，根据显著性度量和压缩目标对缩放器和二进制矩阵施加不同约束。

Result: 在视觉问答任务上，Bi-VLM在语言模型部分比SOTA方法提升3%-47%，在整个VLM上提升4%-45%。量化模型存在90%-99%的图像令牌冗余，可进一步剪枝提升效率。

Conclusion: Bi-VLM成功实现了视觉语言模型的超低比特量化，显著提升了计算效率，同时保持了模型性能，为硬件受限环境下的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

Method: 将多尺度向量量化集成到自监督学习流程中，通过离散表示瓶颈约束模型学习可重复、结构感知的特征，同时抑制视图特定或低效用模式。

Result: DiSSECT在分类和分割任务上表现优异，需要极少或无需微调，在低标签情况下具有高标签效率，在多个公共医学影像数据集上验证了其鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: DiSSECT框架通过离散表示瓶颈有效解决了医学图像自监督学习中的捷径学习问题，提高了表示的可迁移性和任务性能，为有限标注数据的医学影像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 美国每年发生约210万起鹿车碰撞事故，造成约440人死亡、5.9万人受伤和100亿美元经济损失，同时导致鹿群数量下降，急需有效的预防技术。

Method: 使用热成像技术和深度学习算法，基于在北卡罗来纳州Mars Hill收集的12,000多张热成像鹿图像数据集进行训练和验证，并通过CV2X通信设备实现车辆间数据共享。

Result: 系统表现优异：平均精度98.84%，精确率95.44%，召回率95.96%。在恶劣天气条件下检测准确率保持在88-92%，而传统可见光摄像头效果低于60%。端到端延迟始终低于100毫秒。

Conclusion: 该系统通过热成像和车联网技术为减少鹿车碰撞提供了可行的技术路径，现场测试验证了其在各种天气条件下的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Motivation: 手术数据标注稀缺限制了深度学习系统在计算机辅助干预中的发展，现有扩散模型存在数据记忆问题，导致样本不一致且多样性不足

Method: 构建偏好和非偏好合成图像对，通过轻量级微调使扩散模型生成过程与下游目标明确对齐，并进行迭代优化

Result: 在三个手术数据集上，分类任务提升7-9%，分割任务提升2-10%，对代表性不足类别改善显著，迭代优化进一步提升4-10%性能

Conclusion: SAADi方法克服了样本退化问题，确立了任务感知对齐作为缓解数据稀缺和推进手术视觉应用的关键原则

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

Motivation: 动态PET中时间帧的图像质量因统计量有限而难以保证，特别是短帧图像。深度学习在医学图像去噪中显示出潜力，但需要更好地利用动态PET的时空相关性。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上的实验表明，KMDS-Net在动态PET去噪方面表现出色，优于之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效实现动态PET的高时空分辨率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

Conclusion: 通过光流标签插值和多任务学习的结合，有效解决了手术场景中时空标注不平衡的问题，提升了手术场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label

general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

### [80] [ViG-LRGC: Vision Graph Neural Networks with Learnable Reparameterized Graph Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18840)
*Ismael Elsharkawi,Hossam Sharara,Ahmed Rafea*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可学习的重参数化图构建方法（LRGC），用于视觉图神经网络，通过可学习的注意力机制和软阈值重参数化来构建图像图表示，无需超参数搜索，在ImageNet-1k上超越了现有ViG模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViG模型依赖非参数化的统计方法构建图结构，这些方法无法为每个节点选择最佳邻域，且需要超参数搜索。现有方法（如k-NN、超图构建等）缺乏可学习的超参数无关图构建能力。

Method: LRGC方法在每对节点间应用键值注意力机制，然后使用软阈值重参数化进行边选择，构建可微的数学模型。通过可学习参数选择邻域，避免传统聚类或阈值方法的偏差，且阈值可在训练中学习而非作为超参数提供。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k基准数据集上，提出的ViG-LRGC方法在相似模型规模下优于最先进的ViG模型。

Conclusion: LRGC提供了一种可学习的超参数无关图构建方法，能够自适应地构建最优图结构，显著提升了视觉图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或手动设计的提示，限制了SAM的可扩展性和泛化能力，需要自动化的提示优化方法。

Method: 构建任务无关的点提示环境，将图像块表示为双空间图中的节点，使用深度Q网络训练攻击者和防御者智能体，攻击者学习降低分割性能，防御者学习恢复准确性。

Conclusion: Point Prompt Defender为基于提示的分割提供了一个有效的自动化优化解决方案，无需重新训练即可提升SAM在各种任务上的性能。

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeblurSplat是一种无需运动结构恢复的基于事件相机的去模糊3D高斯溅射方法，通过利用预训练的稠密立体模块直接获取初始点云，并引入事件流进行细粒度监督，实现高效高质量的去模糊3D场景重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于运动结构恢复方法中相机位姿估计误差累积导致点云位置不准确的问题，以及利用事件相机对动态变化的高灵敏度来改进去模糊效果。

Method: 1. 使用预训练的DUSt3R稠密立体模块直接从模糊图像获取准确初始点云，避免相机位姿估计误差传递；2. 引入事件流与模糊图像共同解码潜在清晰图像，为场景重建优化提供细粒度监督信号。

Result: 在多个场景上的广泛实验表明，DeblurSplat不仅能生成高保真度的新视角图像，而且在去模糊3D高斯溅射方面相比现有最优方法实现了显著的渲染效率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需运动结构恢复的高效去模糊3D场景重建，证明了事件相机在动态场景重建中的优势，为实时高质量3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically

directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

Conclusion: 通过将AVS任务重新定义为频率域分解和重组问题，提出的FAVS框架有效解决了音频-视觉模态的频率域矛盾，为多模态机器学习提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Deep learning has become the de facto standard and dominant paradigm in image
analysis tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. However, this approach
often results in "black-box" models, whose decision-making processes are
difficult to interpret, raising concerns about reliability in critical
applications. To address this challenge and provide human a method to
understand how AI model process and make decision, the field of xAI has
emerged. This paper surveys four representative approaches in xAI for visual
perception tasks: (i) Saliency Maps, (ii) Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM),
(iii) Prototype-based methods, and (iv) Hybrid approaches. We analyze their
underlying mechanisms, strengths and limitations, as well as evaluation
metrics, thereby providing a comprehensive overview to guide future research

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly
available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

### [93] [Seeing Through Reflections: Advancing 3D Scene Reconstruction in Mirror-Containing Environments with Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18956)
*Zijing Guo,Yunyang Zhao,Lin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MirrorScene3D数据集和ReflectiveGS方法，用于解决含镜面环境中的3D重建和新视角合成问题，通过利用镜面反射作为补充视角来提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在含镜面场景中性能下降，主要关注镜面表面的对称映射而忽略了镜面反射携带的丰富信息，这些反射可以提供补充视角来填补缺失细节。

Method: 提出了ReflectiveGS方法，基于3D高斯泼溅技术，将镜面反射作为补充视角而非简单的对称伪影，从而增强场景几何并恢复缺失细节。

Result: 在MirrorScene3D数据集上的实验表明，ReflectiveGS在SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS指标和训练速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReflectiveGS为镜面丰富环境中的3D重建设立了新的基准，证明了利用镜面反射作为补充视角的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

Conclusion: 深度学习技术可以有效改善腹腔镜胆囊切除术中的胆道可视化，为降低胆管损伤风险提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在恶劣天气条件下的有效性，超越了现有最先进的自监督方法。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉基础模型的先验知识和场景对应性学习，本文提出的方法显著提升了立体匹配在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

TL;DR: 提出Prompt-DAS框架，通过多任务学习和提示机制实现电子显微镜图像中细胞器的领域自适应分割，支持无监督、弱监督和交互式分割


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模电子显微镜图像中细胞器实例分割需要大量标注数据的问题，实现标注高效的学习

Method: 基于SAM的提示式多任务框架，结合辅助中心点检测任务和提示引导对比学习，支持不同提示配置（全点、稀疏点、无点）

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中表现出优于现有UDA、WDA和SAM方法的性能

Conclusion: Prompt-DAS是一个灵活有效的领域自适应分割框架，能够适应不同的标注场景并取得优异性能

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

Motivation: 儿童脑积水的评估具有挑战性，现有研究受限于缺乏公开可用的专家标注数据集，特别是包含脉络丛分割的数据集。

Method: 使用切片到体积算法从常规低分辨率图像重建3D MRI，由经验丰富的神经学家手动校正脑组织分割，并使用检索增强生成框架从临床放射学报告中提取结构化数据。

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with
hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was
reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume
algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white
matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus,
were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was
extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and
total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging
algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in
hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决食物图像分割需要大量像素级标注的问题，利用SAM的零样本能力和ViT的注意力机制，开发仅需图像级标注的弱监督分割方法。

Method: 使用Swin Transformer生成类激活图作为SAM的提示，结合图像预处理技术和单掩码/多掩码生成策略，在FoodSeg103数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在FoodSeg103数据集上平均每张图像生成2.4个掩码（不含背景），多掩码场景下mIoU达到0.54。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为加速食物图像标注的工具，或集成到食物营养追踪应用中，展示了弱监督分割在食物图像分析中的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

TL;DR: DyL-UNet是一种基于动态学习的时序一致性U-Net分割架构，用于实现时间稳定且精确的超声心动图分割，通过构建Echo-Dynamics Graph和引入Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention来提升分割的时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图容易发生变形和散斑噪声，导致帧间分割抖动。即使单帧分割精度高，时间不稳定性也会削弱功能估计并影响临床可解释性。

Method: 提出DyL-UNet框架，通过动态学习构建Echo-Dynamics Graph提取视频动态信息，使用多个基于Swin-Transformer的编码器-解码器分支处理单帧图像，并在跳跃连接处引入Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention，利用EDG编码的动态特征和心脏相位线索来强制分割的时间一致性。

Result: 在CAMUS和EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上的广泛实验表明，DyL-UNet在保持与现有方法相当的分割精度的同时，实现了更优的时间一致性。

Conclusion: DyL-UNet为自动化临床超声心动图提供了可靠的解决方案，能够实现时间稳定且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多尺度特征交互网络(MsFIN)用于从行车记录仪视频中早期预测交通事故，通过多尺度特征聚合、时序特征处理和后融合来解决交通参与者特征交互和复杂多时序行为建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着行车记录仪的普及和计算机视觉技术的发展，从行车记录仪视角开发事故预测模型对于主动安全干预变得至关重要。但存在两个关键挑战：建模交通参与者之间的特征级交互（在行车记录仪视图中经常被遮挡）和捕捉事故前复杂异步的多时序行为线索。

Method: MsFIN包含三个层次：多尺度特征聚合层使用多尺度模块提取短期、中期和长期时间尺度的场景表示，并利用Transformer架构促进全面特征交互；时序特征处理层在因果约束下捕捉场景和对象特征的序列演化；多尺度特征后融合阶段融合多个时间尺度的场景和对象特征生成综合风险表示。

Result: 在DAD和DADA数据集上的实验表明，MsFIN在预测准确性和及时性方面显著优于单尺度特征提取的最先进模型。消融研究验证了MsFIN中每个模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MsFIN通过多尺度特征融合和上下文交互建模实现了优越性能，证明了多尺度方法在交通事故早期预测中的有效性。

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WaveletGaussian是一个用于稀疏视图3D高斯对象重建的高效框架，通过将扩散过程转移到小波域，仅在低分辨率LL子带应用扩散，而高频子带使用轻量网络优化，显著减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在稀疏视图设置下性能急剧下降，现有方法使用扩散模型修复损坏的渲染图作为伪真值进行优化，但计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出小波域扩散方法：仅对低分辨率LL子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量网络细化；采用高效的在线随机掩码策略替代低效的留一法来准备扩散微调的训练对。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和OmniObject3D两个基准数据集上的实验表明，WaveletGaussian在保持竞争力的渲染质量的同时大幅减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian通过小波域扩散和高效训练策略，实现了稀疏视图3D高斯重建的高效优化，在质量和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

Motivation: 发现Sa2VA模型在视频对象分割任务中未能充分发挥潜力，主要原因是训练和推理过程存在不一致性。

Result: Sa2VA-i在多个视频基准上取得显著提升：MeViS提升+11.6 J&F，Ref-YT-VOS提升+1.4，Ref-DAVIS提升+3.3，ReVOS提升+4.1。Sa2VA-i-1B模型在MeViS基准上甚至能与原Sa2VA-26B模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了看似琐碎的实现细节的重要性，为视频分割领域提供了有价值的见解，代码和更新模型已开源。

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

Motivation: 多光谱图像在遥感应用中很重要，但现有的机器学习模型需要专门训练且成本高。强大的通用多模态模型无法处理多光谱数据，限制了其应用。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了地理空间专业人员可以轻松利用强大多模态模型处理专业传感器数据的潜力，加速工作流程。

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe

Conclusion: MLLMs与先进视觉分析技术结合在交通事故检测中具有巨大潜力，可增强现实世界自动化交通监控系统的适用性。

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

TL;DR: Track-On2是一个基于Transformer的在线长期点跟踪模型，通过架构改进、内存优化和合成训练策略提升性能，在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期点跟踪问题，需要在视频帧间实现一致的点识别，特别是在显著外观变化、运动和遮挡的情况下，同时满足实时和流式应用的在线处理需求

Method: 扩展Track-On模型，采用因果处理框架，通过内存机制保持时间一致性，进行粗粒度补丁级分类后细化，并系统研究合成训练对内存行为的影响

Result: 在五个合成和真实世界基准测试中取得最先进结果，超越了先前的在线跟踪器甚至利用双向上下文的强离线方法

Conclusion: 基于因果、内存架构的纯合成数据训练方法为真实世界点跟踪提供了可扩展的有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 该方法在息肉大小和精确定位检测方面表现出鲁棒性，具有临床应用的潜力，可用于AI辅助结直肠癌筛查。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

concept-aware memory supplies semantic priors that suppress distractors;
together, these traits directly benefit several MOSEv2's core challenges. Our

TL;DR: 本文基于人类视觉的双流假说，将VLM的视觉处理解构为物体识别和空间感知两个独立部分进行研究，揭示了VLM内部工作机制，并提出了提升解码效率和空间推理能力的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM通过序列化图像处理视觉信息，与人类视觉的并行处理方式存在差异，且其不透明的内部机制阻碍了深度理解和架构创新。受人类视觉双流假说启发，作者希望深入理解VLM的视觉处理机制。

Method: 1. 物体识别：将图像转换为文本标记图，分析模型从浅层到深层的两阶段处理过程；2. 空间感知：理论推导和实验验证VLM中位置表示的几何结构；3. 提出基于即插即用视觉解码器的指令无关标记压缩算法和RoPE缩放技术。

Result: 实验验证了VLM视觉处理的两阶段机制（属性识别到语义消歧）和位置表示的几何结构，提出的方法有效提升了解码效率和空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为理解VLM内部机制提供了深刻见解，并为设计更强大未来架构提供了明确原则，验证了基于人类视觉双流假说的分析框架的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无视觉编码器的文本到文本检索方法，通过使用VLLM生成结构化图像描述来替代传统文本到图像检索，解决了多模态模型的模态差距问题，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的对比学习视觉语言模型（如CLIP）存在浅层语言理解、模态差距大、计算成本高和隐私问题等局限性。本文旨在通过消除视觉编码器来克服这些问题。

Method: 采用文本到文本检索范式，使用VLLM生成结构化图像描述，仅需在两张GPU上进行几小时的校准训练，构建了一个仅使用单一文本编码器的检索流程。

Result: 该方法显著减少了模态差距，提高了组合性，在短长文本查询上表现更好，在多个检索和组合性基准测试中达到零样本最先进性能，即使模型参数仅为0.3B。

Conclusion: 无视觉编码器的文本到文本检索方法不仅性能优越，而且更高效、隐私友好，为多模态检索提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

TL;DR: 本文研究了对比视觉语言模型（VLM）中组合性与长标题理解之间的双向关系，发现两者可以相互促进，但训练效果受数据质量和模型设计影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比视觉语言模型在处理长而密集的标题时存在困难，作者假设组合性（推理对象-属性绑定和对象间关系的能力）是理解长标题的关键。

Method: 训练和评估了一系列针对组合性和长标题理解能力的模型，分析了不同训练策略（如冻结位置嵌入）和数据质量对性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现组合性训练能提高长标题检索性能，长标题训练也能促进组合性，但这种增益对数据质量和模型设计敏感。高质量的长标题数据训练可以实现两种任务的强性能。

Conclusion: 组合性理解和长标题理解是相互交织的能力，可以通过在密集、有基础描述的标题上进行训练来共同学习，为改进VLM泛化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频相似性模型依赖全局相似度评分，无法像人类那样从多个方面（如动作、地点等）进行细粒度比较。大型多模态模型的出现为利用自然语言进行视频比较任务提供了新机会。

Method: 引入ConViS任务框架，通过预定义语义概念计算视频对的相似性分数；构建ConViS-Bench基准数据集，包含多领域视频对及其概念级相似性评分和文本描述；对多种先进模型进行基准测试。

Result: 不同模型在ConViS任务上表现差异显著，某些概念对视频相似性估计更具挑战性。

Conclusion: ConViS-Bench将成为语言驱动视频理解研究的重要资源，有助于推动视频相似性评估向更细粒度、可解释的方向发展。

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图放射组学学习（GrRAiL）描述符，用于在临床MRI扫描中表征病灶内异质性，通过图论指标量化空间关联，在区分肿瘤复发与放射效应方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决固体肿瘤中可靠区分恶性病变与混淆病理的挑战，传统放射组学方法常忽略复杂的空间关系，需要更有效的方法来捕捉病灶内异质性。

Method: GrRAiL方法：1）使用逐体素放射组学测量识别亚区域聚类；2）计算图论指标来量化聚类间的空间关联，生成加权图编码高阶空间关系。

Result: 在947名受试者的多机构评估中，GrRAiL在三个应用场景中均显著优于现有方法：胶质母细胞瘤（测试准确率78%，提升>10%）、脑转移瘤（测试准确率74%，提升>13%）、胰腺IPMN风险分层（测试准确率75%，提升>10%）。

Conclusion: GrRAiL能够可靠捕捉病灶内异质性，有效区分恶性病变与混淆病理，在临床MRI应用中表现出优越性能和临床可行性。

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

TL;DR: CLOPS是第一个仅使用自我中心视觉感知环境和导航的人类化身，通过将低级运动技能学习与高级视觉控制解耦来实现人类化运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人类运动生成方法忽视了感知与运动之间的相互依赖关系，使用与人类感知截然不同的任务特定"感知"。作者认为生成类人化身行为需要类人感知。

Method: 首先在大规模运动捕捉数据集上训练运动先验模型，然后使用Q学习训练策略，将自我中心视觉输入映射到运动先验的高级控制命令。

Result: 实验证明自我中心视觉能够在化身中产生类人运动特征，例如化身会根据视觉场中的障碍物调整行走路径以避免碰撞。

Conclusion: 为化身配备类人传感器（特别是自我中心视觉）有望训练出行为像人类的化身。

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

TL;DR: 该论文针对布局到图像生成中边界框重叠问题，提出了OverLayScore量化指标和OverLayBench基准，并开发了CreatiLayout-AM模型来改善重叠区域的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局到图像生成方法在处理边界框显著重叠时表现不佳，特别是在大重叠区域和语义区分度小的重叠实例上，现有基准存在偏向简单案例的偏差。

Method: 引入OverLayScore指标量化重叠复杂度，构建OverLayBench基准数据集，并提出基于模态掩码数据集微调的CreatiLayout-AM模型。

Result: 分析显示现有基准偏向低OverLayScore的简单案例，新基准提供了更平衡的评估，提出的模型在复杂重叠场景下表现更好。

Conclusion: 该研究为现实复杂场景下的布局到图像生成奠定了更鲁棒的基础，通过新指标、基准和模型解决了重叠边界框的挑战。

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VolSplat提出了一种新的多视图前馈3D高斯溅射方法，用体素对齐的高斯预测取代像素对齐方法，解决了现有方法对输入视图数量的依赖、视角偏差密度分布和对齐误差等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素对齐高斯预测的方法存在三个主要问题：重建的3D模型严重依赖输入视图数量、产生视角偏差的密度分布、在遮挡或低纹理区域引入对齐误差。

Method: VolSplat通过预测3D体素网格直接生成高斯，避免了依赖误差较大的2D特征匹配，确保多视图一致性，并能根据3D场景复杂度自适应控制高斯密度。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和ScanNet等基准测试中，VolSplat实现了最先进的性能，产生更合理和视图一致的高斯重建，渲染质量更高。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅取得了优越的结果，还为前馈3D重建建立了更可扩展的框架，为更广泛的研究社区铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on
our project page: https://lhmd.top/volsplat.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAR-Flow是一种条件感知重参数化方法，通过在流匹配中学习轻量级的偏移来调节源分布、目标分布或两者，从而缩短概率路径，加速训练并提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散和基于流的方法需要模型同时学习质量传输和条件注入，这增加了模型的学习负担。为了减轻模型负担，作者提出了条件感知重参数化方法。

Method: CAR-Flow通过学习轻量级的偏移来调节源分布和目标分布，重新定位这些分布以缩短概率路径。该方法引入的参数增量小于0.6%。

Result: 在低维合成数据上可视化和量化了CAR的效果。在ImageNet-256上，将CAR-Flow应用于SiT-XL/2模型，FID从2.07降低到1.68。

Conclusion: CAR-Flow通过条件感知重参数化有效缩短了概率路径，在引入极少额外参数的情况下显著提升了生成质量，证明了该方法的高效性。

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多任务学习框架，通过动态提示调度机制来解决大语言模型在多任务和跨域设置下的泛化限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SPoT依赖固定提示模板，存在泛化能力不足的问题，需要更灵活的动态提示调度机制来提升模型在多任务和跨域场景下的性能。

Method: 采用动态提示调度机制，包括提示池和任务感知调度策略，通过任务嵌入和门控机制精细控制提示信号，结合联合多任务学习优化目标和自动学习调度权重策略。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在一系列语言理解和知识推理任务上显著提升性能，证明了其在统一多任务建模和跨域适应中的有效性和稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的动态提示调度框架有效解决了多任务学习中的任务干扰和负迁移问题，显著提升了模型的泛化能力和跨域适应性。

Abstract: This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in
large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior
methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study
introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt
scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling
strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different
tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across
tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating
mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between
prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible
sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective
centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning
strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference
and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of
sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact
of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm
the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and
enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt
scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language
understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate
its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and
cross-domain adaptation.

Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法往往过于笼统，缺乏对具体数学技能的细粒度分析。GAUSS旨在通过技能维度的分类，更准确地评估模型的基础数学智能。

Method: 将数学问题按12个核心技能维度分类，设计能够隔离特定数学能力的任务，构建综合评估框架。以GPT-5-thinking为例展示基准使用方法。

Result: GAUSS能够生成模型数学能力的详细画像，准确反映其基础数学智能。通过比较GPT-5-thinking和o4-mini-high，展示了多维技能评估的价值。

Conclusion: GAUSS基准提供了比传统评估更全面、细粒度的LLM数学能力分析框架，有助于深入理解模型的数学智能优势和不足。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of
\textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a
benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill
dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem
solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing
problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate
specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and
interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles
faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify
how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of
\textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its
differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value
of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Rubin因果模型的事件因果关系识别方法，通过将事件视为治疗和结果，利用合成控制方法生成虚拟双胞胎来估计因果效应，在COPES-hard基准上表现优于包括GPT-4在内的现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的事件因果关系识别方法依赖语言模式和多跳关系推理，容易因因果关系的非正式使用和虚假的图推理而导致错误识别。需要更稳健的方法来区分因果关系和相关关系。

Method: 采用Rubin因果模型框架，将时序上先发生的事件视为治疗，后发生的事件视为结果。通过合成控制方法生成虚拟双胞胎——该双胞胎在治疗前与主角有相同的生活经历，但在治疗时经历干预。使用文本嵌入合成和反转技术从相关历史数据中生成这样的双胞胎。

Result: 该方法在因果关系基准COPES-hard上表现出色，识别因果关系的能力比包括GPT-4在内的先前方法更加稳健。

Conclusion: 基于Rubin因果模型的合成控制方法为文本领域的事件因果关系识别提供了更可靠的理论基础和实践方案，能够有效避免传统方法中的虚假因果关系识别问题。

Abstract: Event causality identification (ECI), a process that extracts causal
relations between events from text, is crucial for distinguishing causation
from correlation. Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized
linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality
identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical
inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event
causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the
treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their
causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant
change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to
implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we
try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should
have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but
undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of
locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the
synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical
data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This
approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous
methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark,
COPES-hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法通常只关注用户提示，依赖非结构化反馈，需要大量样本和长迭代周期，导致成本高且脆弱

Method: ZERA使用8个可泛化标准对提示进行评分，并通过自动推断权重进行结构化批判性修订，实现快速收敛到高质量提示

Result: 在5个LLM和9个不同数据集上的实验显示，ZERA在推理、摘要和代码生成任务上均优于强基线

Conclusion: ZERA通过结构化评分和联合优化方法，实现了高效、低成本的提示优化，消融研究验证了各组件对提示构建的有效贡献

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM)
performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods
typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and
require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and
brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a
novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through
principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight
generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts
based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to
high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We
evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning,
summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt
construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at
https://github.com/younatics/zera-agent.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了外部信息对具有逐步思考能力的大语言模型推理过程的因果影响，发现模型的思考模式是一把双刃剑：有帮助的信息能提高准确性，但误导性信息会导致性能灾难性下降，且思考过程会放大错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在现实场景中，LLMs经常被增强外部信息，这些信息可能是有帮助的、无关的甚至是误导性的。论文旨在系统性地测试模型对这些信息的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入SciAux数据集（基于ScienceQA），系统测试模型对有帮助、无关和误导性信息的鲁棒性，分析思考过程如何影响模型性能。

Result: 研究发现模型的思考模式会放大误导性信息的负面影响，导致性能灾难性下降，而不是提供鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 关键挑战不仅是让模型"思考"，更要赋予它们评估推理所依赖信息的批判能力。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to
their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be
helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal
impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with
explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset
derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model
against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical
vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged
sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a
catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process.
Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when
provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely
to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate
the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/billhdzhao/SciAux.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种过程监督的多智能体框架来优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统中检索器和生成器的协调问题，通过决策制定器和知识选择器两个轻量级智能体，结合过程级奖励和树结构探索策略，实现了更高的准确性和更稳定的收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统中，检索器和生成器独立开发导致交互效果不佳：检索器可能返回不相关或冗余文档，而生成器未能充分利用检索到的证据。

Method: 采用过程监督的多智能体框架，包含决策制定器（决定何时继续检索或停止生成答案）和知识选择器（过滤检索文档保留最有用的证据）。使用LLM作为评判员提供过程级奖励，采用树结构展开策略探索多样化推理路径，并使用PPO进行端到端训练。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，该方法相比标准RAG基线实现了更高的准确性、更稳定的收敛性，并产生了更可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架是模块化且即插即用的，无需修改检索器或生成器，为实际RAG应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the
coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components
are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the
retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may
fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a
process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever
and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision
Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer
generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to
retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we
employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with
process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying
solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout
strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on
single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach
achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more
interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines.
Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no
modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world
RAG applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在呼叫中心等对话场景中，客服需要及时了解客户情绪并提供适当解决方案。预测未来话语的情感可以帮助客服提前准备，将不满客户转化为满意客户，具有重要商业价值。

Method: ERFC架构考虑多模态、情感的不同属性、上下文以及对话中说话者话语之间的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上的密集实验证明了所提ERFC方法的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法能为呼叫中心等应用提供巨大的商业价值，客户满意度至关重要。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation has been seen to be widely applicable in
call center analytics, opinion mining, finance, retail, healthcare, and other
industries. In a call center scenario, the role of the call center agent is not
just confined to receiving calls but to also provide good customer experience
by pacifying the frustration or anger of the customers. This can be achieved by
maintaining neutral and positive emotion from the agent. As in any
conversation, the emotion of one speaker is usually dependent on the emotion of
other speaker. Hence the positive emotion of an agent, accompanied with the
right resolution will help in enhancing customer experience. This can change an
unhappy customer to a happy one. Imparting the right resolution at right time
becomes easier if the agent has the insight of the emotion of future
utterances. To predict the emotions of the future utterances we propose a novel
architecture, Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation. Our proposed
ERFC architecture considers multi modalities, different attributes of emotion,
context and the interdependencies of the utterances of the speakers in the
conversation. Our intensive experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset have shown the
feasibility of the proposed ERFC. This approach can provide a tremendous
business value for the applications like call center, where the happiness of
customer is utmost important.

Abstract: Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated
tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous
training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work,
we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content,
specifically leveraging in-context definition as a policy guideline. We explore
various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT.
Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, increasing performance across
all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model sizes, or
reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5.
Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic
divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and
paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences
observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出TEMPO算法，通过前缀树结构解决LLM推理中的token级信用分配问题，在数学和医学QA任务上优于PPO和GRPO。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习能提升LLM推理能力，但长序列中的稀疏延迟奖励使得token级信用分配成为关键瓶颈。在可验证奖励设置下，只有少数决策token对最终结果有显著影响。

Method: 提出Prefix-to-Tree（P2T）方法将响应组转换为前缀树，计算非参数前缀值。基于P2T开发TEMPO算法，结合GRPO的组相对结果信号和分支门控的时序差分修正。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B/4B模型上，TEMPO在分布内（MATH、MedQA）和分布外（GSM-HARD、AMC23等）基准测试中均优于PPO和GRPO，验证准确率更高且训练时间相近。

Conclusion: TEMPO无需学习价值网络或额外评判器，在分支token处提供精确的token级信用分配，是解决LLM推理中信用分配问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over
long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study
the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple
responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align
with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the
outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it
is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is
not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can
make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable
rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores
branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that
converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes
\emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes.
Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated
\textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a
critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO
with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree.
At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO
reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit
without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B,
TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and
out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and
reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

### [133] [Brittleness and Promise: Knowledge Graph Based Reward Modeling for Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18316)
*Saksham Khatwani,He Cheng,Majid Afshar,Dmitriy Dligach,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索了一种新范式：将LLM作为知识图谱推理路径的奖励模型，让模型学习判断候选路径是否能正确诊断患者输入，而不是直接将KG内容插入提示中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常通过检索增强生成或微调来整合知识图谱，但缺乏结构化推理能力。本文受奖励训练和计算理论启发，提出验证解决方案比从零生成更容易，类似于医生的诊断评估过程。

Method: 系统评估了五种知识路径判断的任务制定方法和八种训练范式，测试路径判断能力是否能泛化到下游诊断任务，包括诊断总结和医学问答。使用三个开源指令调优LLM进行实验。

Result: 实验显示特定奖励优化和蒸馏能带来强大的路径判断性能，但向下游任务的可迁移性仍然较弱。

Conclusion: 这是对临床知识图谱进行"奖励模型风格"推理的首次系统评估，为结构化、基于奖励的监督如何影响医疗GenAI系统的诊断推理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often
lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical
knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically
integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG
content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an
alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,
where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct
diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work
that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and
grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is
often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'
diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and
intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first
systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and
eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities
generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization
and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source
instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward
optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the
transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first
systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs,
offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences
diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

*Pei-Shuo Wang,Jian-Jia Chen,Chun-Che Yang,Chi-Chih Chang,Ning-Chi Huang,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubSpec是一种即插即用的无损训练自由方法，通过从卸载的目标LLM部分生成低比特量化替代层来构建高度对齐的草稿模型，加速参数卸载，在有限VRAM下实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在内存受限消费级GPU上部署的挑战，传统压缩方法会降低质量，而卸载方法虽然保持质量但推理速度慢。

Method: 使用快速草稿模型提出多个草稿token，通过目标LLM并行验证；构建高度对齐的草稿模型，生成低比特量化替代层；共享GPU驻留层和KV-Cache以减少内存开销。

Result: 在MT-Bench上对Qwen2.5 7B实现9.1倍加速（8GB VRAM限制），在流行生成基准测试中对Qwen2.5 32B平均实现12.5倍加速（24GB VRAM限制）。

Conclusion: SubSpec方法有效解决了参数卸载中的速度瓶颈，实现了高质量无损加速，适用于内存受限环境。

Abstract: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment
on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter
offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can
degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow
inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate
parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft
tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single
forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward
passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on
pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align
with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model
training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from
insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token
acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,
we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading
that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft
model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target
LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers
and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.
SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for
Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for
Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

### [135] [Speech Vecalign: an Embedding-based Method for Aligning Parallel Speech Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18360)
*Chutong Meng,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech Vecalign是一种并行语音文档对齐方法，通过单调对齐语音片段嵌入实现，不依赖文本转录，相比基线方法产生更长的语音对齐且噪声更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种不依赖文本转录的语音文档对齐方法，提高语音到语音翻译的质量和效率。

Method: 使用单调对齐语音片段嵌入的方法，不依赖文本转录，应用于3000小时的未标记并行英语-德语语音文档。

Result: 产生了约1000小时的高质量对齐数据，英语到德语和德语到英语的翻译性能分别比Global Mining提高了0.37和0.18 ASR-BLEU。

Conclusion: Speech Vecalign在减少8倍原始语音文档使用量的情况下，匹配或超过了SpeechMatrix模型的性能。

Abstract: We present Speech Vecalign, a parallel speech document alignment method that
monotonically aligns speech segment embeddings and does not depend on text
transcriptions. Compared to the baseline method Global Mining, a variant of
speech mining, Speech Vecalign produces longer speech-to-speech alignments. It
also demonstrates greater robustness than Local Mining, another speech mining
variant, as it produces less noise. We applied Speech Vecalign to 3,000 hours
of unlabeled parallel English-German (En-De) speech documents from VoxPopuli,
yielding about 1,000 hours of high-quality alignments. We then trained En-De
speech-to-speech translation models on the aligned data. Speech Vecalign
improves the En-to-De and De-to-En performance over Global Mining by 0.37 and
0.18 ASR-BLEU, respectively. Moreover, our models match or outperform
SpeechMatrix model performance, despite using 8 times fewer raw speech
documents.

### [136] [Interactive Real-Time Speaker Diarization Correction with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18377)
*Xinlu He,Yiwen Guan,Badrivishal Paurana,Zilin Dai,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种LLM辅助的说话人日志校正系统，通过实时用户反馈来修正说话人归属错误，显著降低说话人日志错误率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数自动语音处理系统在"开环"模式下运行，缺乏用户反馈，而人机协作工作流可以显著提高准确性

Method: 系统执行流式ASR和说话人日志，使用LLM生成简洁摘要，接受简短语音反馈并立即整合。开发了split-when-merged技术检测和分割多说话人段，以及基于用户校正的在线说话人注册

Result: 在AMI测试集上的LLM驱动模拟显示，系统显著降低了9.92%的DER和44.23%的说话人混淆错误

Conclusion: 该系统通过实时用户反馈和LLM辅助，有效改善了说话人日志的准确性，为人机协作语音处理提供了可行方案

Abstract: Most automatic speech processing systems operate in "open loop" mode without
user feedback about who said what; yet, human-in-the-loop workflows can
potentially enable higher accuracy. We propose an LLM-assisted speaker
diarization correction system that lets users fix speaker attribution errors in
real time. The pipeline performs streaming ASR and diarization, uses an LLM to
deliver concise summaries to the users, and accepts brief verbal feedback that
is immediately incorporated without disrupting interactions. Moreover, we
develop techniques to make the workflow more effective: First, a
split-when-merged (SWM) technique detects and splits multi-speaker segments
that the ASR erroneously attributes to just a single speaker. Second, online
speaker enrollments are collected based on users' diarization corrections, thus
helping to prevent speaker diarization errors from occurring in the future.
LLM-driven simulations on the AMI test set indicate that our system
substantially reduces DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion error by 44.23%. We
further analyze correction efficacy under different settings, including summary
vs full transcript display, the number of online enrollments limitation, and
correction frequency.

### [137] [NormGenesis: Multicultural Dialogue Generation via Exemplar-Guided Social Norm Modeling and Violation Recovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18395)
*Minki Hong,Jangho Choi,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NormGenesis是一个多文化框架，用于生成和标注英语、中文和韩语的社会基础对话。它提出了一种新的对话类型Violation-to-Resolution(V2R)，模拟规范违反后的对话进展，并通过基于范例的迭代优化提高语言一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范在沟通中决定文化适宜行为，使对话系统能够产生不仅连贯而且社会可接受的回应。现有方法主要关注静态规范分类，缺乏对规范违反后对话动态的建模。

Method: 提出V2R对话类型，模拟规范违反后的识别和适当修复过程；实施基于范例的迭代优化，在对话合成早期引入语言、情感和社会文化期望的对齐；构建包含10,800个多轮对话的数据集，标注规范遵守、说话者意图和情感回应。

Result: 人工和LLM评估显示，NormGenesis在优化质量、对话自然度和泛化性能上显著优于现有数据集；使用V2R增强数据训练的模型在伦理敏感情境中表现出改进的语用能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为文化自适应对话建模建立了新基准，并为跨语言和文化的规范感知生成提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication,
enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but
also socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for
generating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese,
and Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm
classification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution
(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations
through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic
consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based
iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design
introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations
before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a
dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm
adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based
evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing
datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization
performance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit
improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work
establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and
provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically
and culturally diverse languages.

*Armin Tourajmehr,Mohammad Reza Modarres,Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了大语言模型在生成波斯文学文本方面的创造力，通过构建包含20个主题的数据集，并采用托兰斯创造力测试的四个维度（原创性、流畅性、灵活性和精细性）进行评估，同时使用LLM作为自动评分工具验证其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语文学创作，缺乏对非英语文学传统（如波斯文学）的系统评估，且缺乏标准化的创造力评估方法。

Method: 构建波斯文学数据集，采用托兰斯创造力测试的四个维度评估模型输出，使用LLM作为自动评分工具并与人工评分进行可靠性验证，同时分析模型对四种核心文学修辞手法（明喻、隐喻、夸张、对偶）的理解和运用能力。

Result: LLM作为评分工具与人工评分具有强一致性，模型在波斯文学文本生成方面表现出优势和局限性。

Conclusion: LLM在波斯文学创作方面具有潜力但需要进一步改进，强调了跨语言文学创造力评估的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in
generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior
research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of
non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing
creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian
literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset
of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model
outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and
elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce
evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate
its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation
coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models'
ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor,
hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need
for further refinement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种使用语言建模和对话对齐(CA)评分自动测量医患共享决策(SDM)的方法，通过深度学习模型和微调BERT模型计算CA分数，并与SDM结果关联分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动大规模测量共享决策(SDM)的方法，而SDM对于实现以患者为中心的护理至关重要。

Method: 使用157个医患对话视频的42,559个句子，通过上下文-响应对和负采样训练深度学习模型和微调BERT模型，计算四种CA分数，并与SDM结果(决策冲突量表和OPTION12评分)进行关联分析。

Result: DL模型和微调BERTbase模型生成的CA分数与SDM结果显著相关，其中Max CA分数与OPTION12相关，BERTbase生成的Max CA分数与决策冲突量表相关。

Conclusion: 本研究提出了一种可扩展的自动化方法来测量医患对话中的SDM，通过可解释的CA分数具有大规模评估SDM策略的潜力。

Abstract: Shared decision-making (SDM) is necessary to achieve patient-centred care.
Currently no methodology exists to automatically measure SDM at scale. This
study aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language
modelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157
video-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre
trial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations
were transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs
and negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and
fine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each
top-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A
random-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial
arm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the
Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in
Decision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple
comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female,
mean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients
(1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1
of 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1
with 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012)
scores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12.
The Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated
with the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an
impact the association between CA scores and SDM. This study introduces an
automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM in patient-doctor conversations
through explainable CA scores, with potential to evaluate SDM strategies at
scale.

*Daniel Kaiser,Arnoldo Frigessi,Ali Ramezani-Kebrya,Benjamin Ricaud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogniLoad是一个基于认知负荷理论的新型合成基准，通过独立可调的参数来精确分析LLM的长上下文推理能力，揭示了任务长度是主要限制因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文推理基准模糊了关键因素（任务复杂性、干扰信息、任务长度），需要更精确的失败分析工具。

Method: 基于认知负荷理论生成自然语言逻辑谜题，通过三个可调参数（内在难度d、干扰信号比ρ、任务长度N）分别控制内在负荷、外在负荷和关联负荷。

Result: 评估22个先进推理LLM，发现任务长度是主导约束，模型对内在复杂性有不同容忍度，对干扰比呈现U型响应。

Conclusion: CogniLoad提供了系统性、可复现的诊断工具，可用于剖析LLM推理局限并指导未来模型开发。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)
often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor
interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we
introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load
Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with
independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic
difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$)
regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy
for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs,
CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length
as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic
complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic,
factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a
reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM
reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAWCAT是一种线性注意力框架，可将预训练Transformer高效转换为线性复杂度模型，显著扩展上下文窗口并减少计算资源需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer的二次计算复杂度瓶颈，特别是对延迟敏感的长上下文应用，同时避免从头训练线性模型的资源消耗

Method: 结合因果Conv1D层增强局部依赖建模，使用归一化门控线性注意力提高不同上下文长度的泛化能力，通过知识蒸馏将预训练模型转换为线性架构

Result: 在仅使用1K长度序列蒸馏Mistral-7B时，可扩展到22K tokens的上下文窗口；Llama3.2-1B变体在多个长上下文任务上表现优异，预训练token需求减少99.9%

Conclusion: LAWCAT为高性能长上下文线性模型提供了高效路径，适合边缘部署，减少了对长序列训练数据和计算资源的依赖

Abstract: Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect
to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for
latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity
alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch
is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT
(Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization
framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained
transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates
causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs
normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying
context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling
Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval
accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context
window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance
on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark
(QA2\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training
tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster
prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT
thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear
models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive
long-sequence training data and computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在文本丰富的图机器学习任务中应用增多，但缺乏对LLM与图数据交互能力的系统性理解，需要进行大规模评估来指导实践。

Method: 通过大规模控制实验评估多个关键变量轴，包括LLM-图交互模式（提示、工具使用、代码生成）、数据集领域、结构机制、特征特性和模型配置，并分析输入类型的依赖性。

Result: 代码生成方法在图形数据上表现最强，特别是在长文本或高密度图中；所有交互策略在异质图中都有效；代码生成能灵活调整对结构、特征或标签的依赖。

Conclusion: 研究为当前LLM-图交互模式提供了全面的优劣势分析，并为未来方法设计提供了关键原则指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph
machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like
fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest,
the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their
interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled
evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the
strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based
applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing
prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation,
web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting
homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both
short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM
sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by
methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to
quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable
guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance
on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs
where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction
strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption
that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is
able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to
leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a
comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph
interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

Conclusion: 所提出的模型在古典阿拉伯诗歌创作过程中具有协同创作应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to
conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual
transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat
transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic
script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune
ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We
adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset
before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from
English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve
high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed
model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process
of composing classical Arabic poems.

Abstract: The widespread adoption of ChatGPT has raised concerns about its misuse,
highlighting the need for robust detection of AI-generated text. Current
word-level detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing or simple prompts (PSP),
suffer from biases induced by ChatGPT's word-level patterns (CWP) and training
data content, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or
online LLM interaction. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel task to
detect both original and PSP-modified AI-generated texts, and propose a
lightweight framework that classifies texts based on their internal structure,
which remains invariant under word-level changes. Our approach encodes sentence
embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via
attention. We employ contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases from
autoregressive generation and incorporate a causal graph with counterfactual
methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases. Experiments
on two curated datasets, including abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs,
validate the effectiveness of our method.

### [145] [CCQA: Generating Question from Solution Can Improve Inference-Time Reasoning in SLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18536)
*Jin Young Kim,Ji Won Yoon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CCQA是一种针对小型语言模型的新型推理方法，通过循环一致性原理生成问题并评估相似度来选择最佳答案，在数学和常识推理任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理方法在大型语言模型上表现良好，但在小型语言模型上效果不佳，需要开发专门适用于小型模型的有效推理策略。

Method: 基于循环一致性原理，从每个推理路径和答案生成问题，评估生成问题与原问题的相似度，选择相似度最高的候选答案作为最终响应。使用专门的Flan-T5模型进行问题生成。

Result: 在8个模型上的数学和常识推理基准测试中，CCQA一致性地优于现有最先进方法，为小型语言模型建立了新的高效推理基准。

Conclusion: CCQA为小型语言模型提供了一种有效的推理方法，证明了循环一致性在提升小型模型推理能力方面的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the
accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller
models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches
often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose
\textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering
(CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs.
Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning
path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and
then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the
final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions
from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5
model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently.
From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on
mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method
establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source

*Yeongbin Seo,Gayoung Kim,Jaehyung Kim,Jinyoung Yeo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于先验的数据过滤方法，使用语料库级别的词频统计来估计标记先验，作为困惑度过滤的快速替代方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低时间成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于困惑度的数据过滤方法存在时间成本高和模型在处理噪声或分布外样本时不可靠的问题，需要一种更高效可靠的替代方案。

Method: 基于语料库词频统计计算标记先验，通过标记先验的均值和标准差来过滤文档，无需模型推理即可快速筛选数据。

Result: 在20个下游基准测试中取得了最高平均性能，同时将时间成本降低了1000倍以上，并能适应代码、数学等符号语言以及多语言语料。

Conclusion: 基于先验的过滤方法是一种简单而强大的数据选择技术，在效率和效果上都优于传统的困惑度过滤方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora,
careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient
learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance,
it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of
the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we
propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method
that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics,
inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach
filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors,
serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its
simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance
across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x
compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to
symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to
multilingual corpora without supervision

TL;DR: TsqLoRA是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过数据质量驱动选择和敏感性感知的低秩适应来提高大模型微调效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全微调所有模型参数计算成本高且内存密集，现有参数高效微调方法忽视了不同模型层的敏感性差异和训练数据质量的重要性

Method: 包含两个主要组件：质量感知采样机制选择最有信息量的训练数据，以及动态秩分配模块根据每层对参数更新的敏感性调整其秩

Result: 实验结果表明TsqLoRA在多种NLP任务上提高了微调效率，同时保持甚至改进了性能

Conclusion: TsqLoRA为资源受限环境下的模型微调提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models for downstream tasks has become a
fundamental approach in natural language processing. Fully fine-tuning all
model parameters is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially
in resource-constrained environments. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods reduce the number of trainable parameters but typically overlook the
varying sensitivity of different model layers and the importance of training
data. In this work, we propose TsqLoRA, a novel method that integrates
data-quality-driven selection with sensitivity-aware low-rank adaptation,
consisted of two main components: a quality-aware sampling mechanism for
selecting the most informative training data, and a dynamic rank allocation
module that adjusts the rank of each layer based on its sensitivity to
parameter updates. The experimental results demonstrate that TsqLoRA improves
fine-tuning efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance on a
variety of NLP tasks. Our code will be available at

TL;DR: UniECG是首个能够同时执行基于证据的心电图解释和文本条件心电图生成任务的统一模型，通过解耦的两阶段训练方法实现心电图与文本的双向转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一模型（如GPT-5）在视觉语言任务上表现良好，但无法正确理解心电图信号并提供准确的医疗诊断，也不能生成心电图信号。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段训练方法：首先学习基于证据的解释技能（ECG-to-Text），然后通过潜在空间对齐注入心电图生成能力（Text-to-ECG）。

Result: UniECG能够根据用户输入自主选择解释或生成心电图，显著扩展了当前心电图模型的能力边界。

Conclusion: UniECG作为首个心电图统一模型，成功实现了心电图解释和生成的双向任务，代码和检查点将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent unified models such as GPT-5 have achieved encouraging progress on
vision-language tasks. However, these unified models typically fail to
correctly understand ECG signals and provide accurate medical diagnoses, nor
can they correctly generate ECG signals. To address these limitations, we
propose UniECG, the first unified model for ECG capable of concurrently
performing evidence-based ECG interpretation and text-conditioned ECG
generation tasks. Through a decoupled two-stage training approach, the model
first learns evidence-based interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), and then
injects ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) via latent space alignment.
UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate an ECG based on user
input, significantly extending the capability boundaries of current ECG models.
Our code and checkpoints will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究发现，用户偏好与LLM计划的实际帮助性存在显著差距，当前基于偏好的对齐方法可能误导LLM计划的有用性评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM生成计划的对齐方法是否真正反映了计划对用户的实际帮助性，而非仅仅基于用户偏好。

Method: 使用Planorama界面让126名用户回答300个多步骤问题，收集4388次计划执行和5584次比较数据，测量计划帮助性（QA成功率）和用户偏好。

Result: 用户/模型偏好和代理成功率不能准确预测哪些计划真正帮助用户；用户偏好的表面特征（如简洁性）与计划实际帮助性无关。

Conclusion: 需要基于真实用户交互的反馈来对齐有帮助的LLM，而不仅仅是基于看起来有帮助的偏好。

Abstract: To assist users in complex tasks, LLMs generate plans: step-by-step
instructions towards a goal. While alignment methods aim to ensure LLM plans
are helpful, they train (RLHF) or evaluate (ChatbotArena) on what users prefer,
assuming this reflects what helps them. We test this with Planorama: an
interface where 126 users answer 300 multi-step questions with LLM plans. We
get 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA
success) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and
reward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1)
user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans
help users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this
gap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful
when using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and
question similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to
predict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from
real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we
discuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.

TL;DR: CAPE-KG是一个一致性感知的参数保留知识编辑框架，通过知识图谱在多跳问答任务中实现更可靠的知识更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的参数保留知识编辑方法在多跳问答中存在一致性问题，导致知识污染、更新不稳定和检索行为与编辑意图不符，影响了多跳推理的可靠性。

Method: 提出CAPE-KG框架，确保知识图谱的构建、更新和检索始终与多跳问答任务要求对齐，在未编辑和已编辑知识上保持连贯推理。

Result: 在MQuAKE基准测试上的广泛实验显示，CAPE-KG在多跳问答的参数保留知识编辑性能上取得了准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过解决一致性问题，CAPE-KG有效提升了参数保留知识编辑在多跳问答中的可靠性，证明了处理一致性的重要性。

Abstract: Parameter-Preserving Knowledge Editing (PPKE) enables updating models with
new or corrected information without retraining or parameter adjustment. Recent
PPKE approaches based on knowledge graphs (KG) to extend knowledge editing (KE)
capabilities to multi-hop question answering (MHQA). However, these methods
often lack consistency, leading to knowledge contamination, unstable updates,
and retrieval behaviors that fail to reflect the intended edits. Such
inconsistencies undermine the reliability of PPKE in multi- hop reasoning. We
present CAPE-KG, Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Editing with Knowledge
Graphs, a novel consistency-aware framework for PPKE on MHQA. CAPE-KG ensures
KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with the requirements
of the MHQA task, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited
knowledge. Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark show accuracy
improvements in PPKE performance for MHQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of
addressing consistency in PPKE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个分析LLM-as-a-judge评估不确定性的框架，通过保形预测提供LLM评分的预测区间，并设计了针对离散评分任务的序数边界调整方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM-as-a-judge范式在自然语言生成评估中应用广泛，但其评估的不确定性尚未充分探索，这种可靠性不足限制了其在实际应用中的部署。

Method: 使用保形预测方法构建连续预测区间，设计序数边界调整处理离散评分任务，并提出基于区间中点的低偏差评分替代原始模型评分和加权平均。

Result: 实验表明保形预测能够提供具有覆盖保证的有效预测区间，区间中点和法官重新提示方法有助于改善判断质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了不确定性量化方法，提高了评估结果的可靠性，为实际应用提供了更可信的评估工具。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language
models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the
uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability
may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first
framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of
LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs
continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an
ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a
midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model
score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis,
which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with
coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and
judge reprompting for better judgment.

TL;DR: MemOrb是一个轻量级、即插即用的语言强化记忆层，通过将多轮交互提炼为紧凑的策略反思来增强LLM智能体在客服场景中的长期可靠性，无需微调即可显著提升任务成功率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的客服智能体存在跨会话遗忘、重复错误和缺乏持续自我改进机制的问题，在需要稳定性和一致性的动态环境中表现不可靠。

Method: 提出MemOrb方法，将多轮交互提炼成策略反思存储在共享记忆库中，通过检索这些反思来指导决策，无需对模型进行微调。

Result: 实验显示MemOrb显著提高了任务成功率和稳定性，在多轮任务成功率上最高提升63个百分点，并在重复试验中表现出更一致的性能。

Conclusion: 结构化反思是增强冻结LLM智能体在客服场景中长期可靠性的有效机制。

Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed
in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and
lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in
dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better
evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a
measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to
capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of
existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal
reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact
strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and
retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning.
Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and
stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success
rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our
results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for
enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有ASR系统在远场泰语对话中表现不佳，缺乏包含自然重叠语音和真实声学效应的训练数据。

Method: 收集114小时自发三人对话，使用9个独立单通道设备在0.12-10米距离录音，提供标准数据集划分和可复现基线系统。

Result: 零样本Whisper模型随距离增加性能显著下降，微调后整体WER从64.3降至38.3，远场WER从81.6降至49.5。

Conclusion: 距离多样化的训练数据对鲁棒ASR至关重要，LOTUSDIS填补了泰语远场对话数据的空白。

Abstract: We present LOTUSDIS, a publicly available Thai meeting corpus designed to
advance far-field conversational ASR. The dataset comprises 114 hours of
spontaneous, unscripted dialogue collected in 15-20 minute sessions with three
participants, where overlapping speech is frequent and natural. Speech was
recorded simultaneously by nine independent single-channel devices spanning six
microphone types at distances from 0.12 m to 10 m, preserving the authentic
effects of reverberation, noise, and device coloration without relying on
microphone arrays. We provide standard train, dev, test splits and release a
reproducible baseline system. We benchmarked several Whisper variants under
zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Off-the-shelf models showed strong
degradation with distance, confirming a mismatch between pre-training data and
Thai far-field speech. Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved
robustness: a Thai Whisper baseline reduced overall WER from 64.3 to 38.3 and
far-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with especially large gains on the most
distant microphones. These results underscore the importance of
distance-diverse training data for robust ASR. The corpus is available under
CC-BY-SA 4.0. We also release training and evaluation scripts as a baseline
system to promote reproducible research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对静态文本属性图，难以处理动态图中近期-全局时间语义的捕捉问题，且LLM在处理动态文本时存在效率问题。

Method: 提出DyGRASP方法：1）节点中心隐式推理+滑动窗口捕捉近期语义；2）显式推理+RNN链结构捕捉全局语义演化；3）更新合并层整合语义和结构信息。

Result: 在DyTAG基准测试中，目标节点检索任务的Hit@10指标提升高达34%，且在不同时序GNN和LLM上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyGRASP有效解决了动态文本属性图中的时间语义捕捉问题，为动态图分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph
interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world
applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing
methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global
temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts
and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying
LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic
Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to
efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a
node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism
to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture
global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored
prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,
we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as
the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.
Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,
achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.
Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs
and LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言分词器中词汇重叠对跨语言迁移的影响，通过控制实验发现词汇重叠有助于跨语言语义关系的捕捉，并能提升跨语言任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言分词器自然会产生跨语言的重叠词汇，但现有研究对词汇重叠是否促进跨语言迁移还是引入干扰存在争议，部分原因是实验设置和混淆变量（如词汇频率、分词粒度）的差异。

Method: 设计了控制实验，在多种语言对上训练双语自回归模型，系统性地改变词汇重叠设置，并引入新的维度——跨语言共享词汇的语义相似性来分析重叠的影响。

Result: 分析模型隐藏表示发现，任何类型的重叠都能创建捕捉跨语言语义关系的嵌入空间，而词汇不相交的模型效果较弱。在XNLI和XQuAD任务上，有重叠的模型表现优于词汇不相交的模型，且随着重叠增加，迁移性能普遍提升。

Conclusion: 词汇重叠在多语言模型中具有优势，保持大量共享词汇仍然是多语言分词器的有益设计选择。

Abstract: Subword tokenizers trained on multilingual corpora naturally produce
overlapping tokens across languages. Does token overlap facilitate
cross-lingual transfer or instead introduce interference between languages?
Prior work offers mixed evidence, partly due to varied setups and confounders,
such as token frequency or subword segmentation granularity. To address this
question, we devise a controlled experiment where we train bilingual
autoregressive models on multiple language pairs under systematically varied
vocabulary overlap settings. Crucially, we explore a new dimension to
understanding how overlap affects transfer: the semantic similarity of tokens
shared across languages. We first analyze our models' hidden representations
and find that overlap of any kind creates embedding spaces that capture
cross-lingual semantic relationships, while this effect is much weaker in
models with disjoint vocabularies. On XNLI and XQuAD, we find that models with
overlap outperform models with disjoint vocabularies, and that transfer
performance generally improves as overlap increases. Overall, our findings
highlight the advantages of token overlap in multilingual models and show that
substantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for
multilingual tokenizers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，与长上下文预训练导致短上下文任务性能下降的常见现象相反，长上下文监督微调（SFT）反而能提升短上下文任务的性能。通过分析多头注意力机制和前馈网络，揭示了长上下文SFT促进上下文知识而短上下文SFT偏好参数知识的偏差，并提出混合训练方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着实际应用对长上下文窗口需求的增加，长上下文数据的持续预训练和监督微调成为常见方法。虽然持续预训练中数据长度的影响已被广泛研究，但其在监督微调中的影响尚不明确。

Method: 系统研究SFT数据长度如何影响LLM在短上下文任务上的行为。首先解耦分析多头注意力机制和前馈网络两个关键组件，然后研究它们的交互作用，揭示知识偏好偏差。

Result: 发现长上下文SFT能独立改善MHA和FFN的性能，但会促进上下文知识偏好，而短上下文SFT偏好参数知识。混合训练能够缓解这种偏差。

Conclusion: 长上下文SFT对短上下文任务有积极影响，但需要与短上下文SFT混合使用以获得最佳效果，这为微调LLMs提供了可解释的指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications
increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach.
While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively
studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we
systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on
short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves
short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from
long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this
phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both
independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction
and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual
knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making
exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that
hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for
fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖专家判断和手动分析企业间风险关系的方法主观性强、劳动密集且难以扩展，需要系统化、可量化的解决方案。

Method: 利用10-K文件作为数据源，通过无监督微调基于时间顺序和词汇模式，开发领域特定的金融编码器来捕捉隐含风险关系。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在多个评估设置下优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为企业间风险关系识别提供了系统化、可量化的解决方案，具有透明度和可解释性。

Abstract: A multitude of interconnected risk events -- ranging from regulatory changes
to geopolitical tensions -- can trigger ripple effects across firms.
Identifying inter-firm risk relations is thus crucial for applications like
portfolio management and investment strategy. Traditionally, such assessments
rely on expert judgment and manual analysis, which are, however, subjective,
labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. To address this, we propose a
systematic method for extracting inter-firm risk relations using Form 10-K
filings -- authoritative, standardized financial documents -- as our data
source. Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our approach
captures implicit and abstract risk connections through unsupervised
fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in the filings. This
enables the development of a domain-specific financial encoder with a deeper
contextual understanding and introduces a quantitative risk relation score for
transparency, interpretable analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines across multiple evaluation settings.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在AEC领域的应用增加，需要评估其在安全关键领域的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Method: 建立了包含23个代表性任务的五级认知评估框架，创建了4,800个问题的数据集，并采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行评估。

Result: 评估9个LLM显示，模型在知识记忆和理解层面表现良好，但在复杂推理、计算和专业文档生成方面存在显著性能缺陷。

Conclusion: 本研究为未来在安全关键工程实践中可靠集成LLM的研究和开发奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing
increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the
building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a
specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this
challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed
to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.
The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level
cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,
Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were
derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to
specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset
encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted
primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.
Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable
and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses
leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear
performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite
demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization
and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,
particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing
complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.
Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and
development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into

*Sabri Boughorbel,Fahim Dalvi,Nadir Durrani,Majd Hawasly*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文使用模型差异分析（model diffing）方法，比较Gemma-2-9b-it模型与其SimPO增强变体之间的具体能力差异，发现SimPO主要增强了安全性、多语言能力和指令遵循能力，同时减少了模型自引用和幻觉管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着微调成为改进大语言模型的主要方法，理解微调过程中的具体变化变得日益重要。传统基准测试往往无法解释模型性能差异的原因。

Method: 采用模型差异分析（一种机制可解释性方法），使用crosscoders识别和分类两个模型之间的潜在表示差异。

Result: SimPO获得的潜在概念主要增强了安全机制（+32.8%）、多语言能力（+43.8%）和指令遵循（+151.7%），同时减少了模型自引用（-44.1%）和幻觉管理（-68.5%）的强调。

Conclusion: 模型差异分析能够提供超越排行榜指标的细粒度见解，将性能差距归因于具体的机制能力，为比较LLMs提供了透明且有针对性的框架。

Abstract: As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language
models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly
important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model
outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic
interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences
between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we
identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two
models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance
safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and
instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces
emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management
(-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights
beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete
mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted
framework for comparing LLMs.

*Liting Zhang,Shiwan Zhao,Aobo Kong,Qicheng Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAPEX是一个基于多智能体协作的关键词提取框架，通过动态适应文档长度的双路径策略，在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有无监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督提示方法通常采用单阶段推理管道和统一提示策略，无法充分利用LLM的推理和生成能力，特别是在处理不同长度和复杂度的文档时效果受限。

Method: MAPEX引入多智能体协作框架，包含专家招募、候选提取、主题引导、知识增强和后处理模块，采用双路径策略：短文本使用知识驱动提取，长文本使用主题引导提取。

Result: 在6个基准数据集和3种不同LLM上的实验表明，MAPEX在F1@5指标上平均比最先进的无监督方法高出2.44%，比标准LLM基线高出4.01%。

Conclusion: MAPEX证明了多智能体协作在关键词提取任务中的有效性，能够动态适应不同文档长度，具有强大的泛化能力和普适性。

Abstract: Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing.
However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting,
regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs
hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities,
especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework
that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX
coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate
extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A
dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven
extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs
demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the
state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44\% and standard LLM baselines by
4.01\% in F1@5 on average. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究比较了开源大语言模型与闭源模型在生物医学问答任务中的表现，发现开源模型在特定策略下甚至能超越闭源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源大语言模型的快速发展，研究者希望验证小型开源模型是否能够有效替代大型闭源模型，特别是在生物医学问答这一专业领域。

Method: 使用嵌入距离检索相关片段、上下文学习、结构化输出等技术，并对精确答案问题采用集成方法结合不同模型的输出。

Result: 开源大语言模型与闭源模型表现相当，在某些情况下，特别是应用集成策略时，开源模型甚至超越了闭源模型。

Conclusion: 开源大语言模型在生物医学问答任务中具有与闭源模型相媲美的能力，证明了开源模型的实用价值。

Abstract: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing,
with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to
proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small
open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source
models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical
question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B
of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models
against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various
techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding
distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions,
we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by
different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that
open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances,
open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when
ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at

### [162] [Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection for Large Language Model Generated Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18862)
*Luyan Zhang,Xinyu Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多层级特征集成在AI文本检测中的效果，发现尽管理论上多特征方法应优于单一模型，但实际仅带来微小改进（0.4-0.5%），同时计算成本显著增加（4.2倍）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，研究者对多特征方法能否显著提升AI文本检测性能产生兴趣。虽然直觉上语义、句法和统计特征的结合应提供互补信号，但这一假设尚未在现代LLM生成文本上得到严格验证。

Method: 实现了MHFD（多层级特征检测）方法，通过自适应融合集成基于DeBERTa的语义分析、句法解析和统计概率特征。

Result: 实验结果显示，MHFD方法在域内检测中达到89.7%的准确率，在跨域检测中保持84.2%的稳定性能，相比现有方法有0.4-2.6%的微小改进。

Conclusion: 多特征集成带来的收益有限，而计算成本显著，表明现代神经语言模型可能已经高效地捕获了大部分相关检测信号。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is
growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve
AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition
suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should
provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested
with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical
investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection,
specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple
feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD
(Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic
analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through
adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite
theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits
(0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x
overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture
most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in
in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain
detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

TL;DR: DivEye是一种基于不可预测性波动的新型AI文本检测框架，通过惊喜度特征捕捉人类文本与LLM生成文本在词汇和结构不可预测性上的差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器依赖token级似然度或黑盒分类器，对高质量生成文本效果不佳且缺乏可解释性，需要更有效的检测方法

Method: 利用基于惊喜度的统计特征来捕捉文本中不可预测性的波动模式，人类文本比LLM输出具有更丰富的词汇和结构不可预测性变化

Result: 在多个基准测试中，零样本检测性能提升达33.2%，与微调基线竞争，对改写和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性，跨领域和模型泛化能力强

Conclusion: DivEye不仅提供有效的AI文本检测，还提供可解释的检测依据，揭示了节奏不可预测性作为LLM检测的强大信号

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of
LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where
synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors
often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these
approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little
interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework
that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using
surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text
exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM
outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical
features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2%
and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple
benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks,
generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of
existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond
detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged,
pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal
for LLM detection.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖资源密集型的生成式大语言模型进行原子事实分解，这限制了效率和可扩展性。作者希望开发一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出JEDI编码器架构，使用合成理性语料库进行训练，联合执行提取式原子事实分解和可解释推理。

Result: JEDI在分布内达到竞争性准确度，在分布外和对抗性设置中显著提高了鲁棒性，优于仅基于提取式理性监督的模型。

Conclusion: 研究表明，使用仅编码器架构和合成理性语料库可以实现自然语言推理中的可解释性和鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as
automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance
interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on
resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform
decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly
performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference
without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training,
we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI
benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive
accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of
distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive
rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust
generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and
synthetic rationales. Code and data available at https://jedi.nicpopovic.com

*Abderrahmane Issam,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用动态时间规整（DTW）对齐语音和文本嵌入的方法，用于端到端语音翻译（E2E-ST）任务，解决了现有方法需要语言特定对齐工具或对齐不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音翻译中语音和文本模态之间的表示差异（模态鸿沟）需要解决。现有方法依赖语言特定的对齐工具或使用最近邻相似性搜索导致对齐不准确，限制了方法的通用性和效果。

Method: 在训练过程中采用动态时间规整（DTW）来对齐语音和文本嵌入，不需要语言特定的对齐工具，能够更准确地建立语音和文本之间的对应关系。

Result: 该方法在E2E-ST任务中有效缩小了模态鸿沟，相比先前工作产生更准确的对齐，在6种语言方向中的5种低资源设置下表现更优，且训练速度显著更快。

Conclusion: DTW对齐方法为E2E-ST提供了一种更通用、准确且高效的对齐方案，特别是在低资源语言场景下具有明显优势。

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) is the task of translating source
speech directly into target text bypassing the intermediate transcription step.
The representation discrepancy between the speech and text modalities has
motivated research on what is known as bridging the modality gap.
State-of-the-art methods addressed this by aligning speech and text
representations on the word or token level. Unfortunately, this requires an
alignment tool that is not available for all languages. Although this issue has
been addressed by aligning speech and text embeddings using nearest-neighbor
similarity search, it does not lead to accurate alignments. In this work, we
adapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during
training. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST. Compared to previous work, our method
produces more accurate alignments and achieves comparable E2E-ST results while
being significantly faster. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous work
in low resource settings on 5 out of 6 language directions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究测试时缩放(TTS)在机器翻译中的应用，发现对于高资源语言，TTS能提升翻译质量，小模型通过大N值可匹配大模型性能，但在固定计算预算下大模型更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型参数缩放虽能提升NLP系统性能但计算成本高昂，测试时缩放(TTS)通过在推理时分配更多计算来生成多个候选并选择最佳，但在机器翻译领域尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 采用简单实用的best-of-N框架，在WMT24基准上测试，覆盖6个高资源和1个低资源语言对、5种模型规模(3B-72B)及多种TTS计算预算(N最大1024)。

Result: 高资源语言中TTS能提升翻译质量，小模型通过大N值可匹配或超越大模型在N=1时的性能但计算成本更高，固定计算预算下大模型更高效，低资源情况下TTS可能因指标盲点而降低质量。

Conclusion: TTS是机器翻译中有效的替代策略，但需根据语言资源和计算预算权衡使用，大模型在效率上具有优势，低资源场景需谨慎应用TTS。

Abstract: Scaling model parameters has become the de facto strategy for improving NLP
systems, but it comes with substantial computational costs. Test-Time Scaling
(TTS) offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference:
generating multiple candidates and selecting the best. While effective in tasks
such as mathematical reasoning, TTS has not been systematically explored for
machine translation (MT). In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of TTS for MT, investigating a simple but practical best-of-N framework on
WMT24 benchmarks. Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource
language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up
to 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally
improves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation
metrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller
models with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more
compute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more
efficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in
low-resource cases.

proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to
2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its
metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well
as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal
is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable
insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting
informed decisions and future directions in the field.

TL;DR: PoT是一种推理阶段方法，通过建模LLM的迭代决策过程，动态选择认知操作来生成多样化候选响应，并根据用户偏好聚合得到个性化QA响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化QA系统对于适应用户特定信息需求至关重要，但面临从长、嘈杂、隐式上下文中推断偏好以及生成正确、上下文适当且符合用户期望的响应的挑战。

Method: 提出Pathways of Thoughts (PoT)方法，将LLM推理建模为迭代决策过程，动态选择推理、修订、个性化和澄清等认知操作，探索多种推理轨迹生成多样化候选响应，然后根据推断的用户偏好进行聚合和重新加权。

Result: 在LaMP-QA个性化QA基准测试中，PoT始终优于竞争基线，相对改进高达13.1%。人工评估显示66%的情况下标注者偏好PoT输出，仅15%为平局。

Conclusion: PoT方法有效解决了个性化QA的挑战，无需任务特定微调即可应用于任何LLM，通过多样化推理路径的互补优势显著提升个性化QA性能。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to
user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user
satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to
challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit
contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct,
contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT),
an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM)
without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning
of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects
among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and
clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,
producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT
then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user
preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the
complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA
benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms
competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human
evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from
PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析不同语料库中的句子重复率，实证检验了语言学中关于大多数语句都是独特的这一常见说法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验语言学中关于大多数语言表达都是独特的这一常见说法（如Pinker和Chomsky所主张的），利用大型语料库的可用性进行实证研究。

Method: 使用NLTK Python库解析不同体裁的语料库，统计每个语料库中完全相同的字符串匹配数量。

Result: 结果显示，虽然完全独特的句子通常是语料库中的大多数，但这高度受体裁限制，重复句子在任何单个语料库中都不是微不足道的部分。

Conclusion: 语言表达的独特性并非绝对，而是受到语料体裁的显著影响，重复句子在语言使用中占有重要地位。

Abstract: A repeated claim in linguistics is that the majority of linguistic utterances
are unique. For example, Pinker (1994: 10), summarizing an argument by Noam
Chomsky, states that "virtually every sentence that a person utters or
understands is a brand-new combination of words, appearing for the first time
in the history of the universe." With the increased availability of large
corpora, this is a claim that can be empirically investigated. The current
paper addresses the question by using the NLTK Python library to parse corpora
of different genres, providing counts of exact string matches in each. Results
show that while completely unique sentences are often the majority of corpora,
this is highly constrained by genre, and that duplicate sentences are not an
insignificant part of any individual corpus.

Motivation: 为资源有限的吉尔吉斯语创建首个高质量的命名实体识别数据集，以支持该语言的NLP研究和发展。

Method: 构建包含27个实体类别的标注方案，使用传统序列标注方法（如条件随机场）和最先进的多语言transformer模型（如RoBERTa）在数据集上进行评估。

Result: 所有模型在罕见实体类别上都表现困难，但多语言RoBERTa模型在精确率和召回率之间取得了良好平衡，其他多语言模型也获得了可比的结果。

Conclusion: 多语言预训练模型在处理资源有限语言方面既有挑战也有机遇，未来探索更细粒度的标注方案可能为吉尔吉斯语处理管道评估提供更深入的见解。

Abstract: We introduce KyrgyzNER, the first manually annotated named entity recognition
dataset for the Kyrgyz language. Comprising 1,499 news articles from the 24.KG
news portal, the dataset contains 10,900 sentences and 39,075 entity mentions
across 27 named entity classes. We show our annotation scheme, discuss the
challenges encountered in the annotation process, and present the descriptive
statistics. We also evaluate several named entity recognition models, including
traditional sequence labeling approaches based on conditional random fields and
state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models fine-tuned on our
dataset. While all models show difficulties with rare entity categories, models
such as the multilingual RoBERTa variant pretrained on a large corpus across
many languages achieve a promising balance between precision and recall. These
findings emphasize both the challenges and opportunities of using multilingual
pretrained models for processing languages with limited resources. Although the
multilingual RoBERTa model performed best, other multilingual models yielded
comparable results. This suggests that future work exploring more granular
annotation schemes may offer deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing
pipelines evaluation.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to
organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction
methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large
language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a
novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates
LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages
LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset,
evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then
encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In
addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted
taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated
dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为"anecdoctoring"的新型红队评估方法，通过自动生成跨语言和跨文化的对抗性提示来评估生成式AI在虚假信息方面的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的全球采用需要能够适应不同语言和文化的红队评估，但现有的红队数据集通常以美国为中心且仅使用英语，存在明显的局限性。

Method: 从三个语言（英语、西班牙语、印地语）和两个地区（美国和印度）的事实核查网站收集虚假信息声明，将个体声明聚类为更广泛的叙事，并使用知识图谱来增强攻击者LLM。

Result: 该方法相比少样本提示产生了更高的攻击成功率，并提供了更好的可解释性优势。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了需要基于真实世界对抗性滥用的、能够全球扩展的虚假信息缓解措施。

Abstract: Disinformation is among the top risks of generative artificial intelligence
(AI) misuse. Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming
evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across
diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and
English-centric. To address this gap, we propose "anecdoctoring", a novel
red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across
languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking
websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies
(US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and
characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we
augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and
offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results
underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are
grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.

Result: 研究发现二元"slop"判断具有一定主观性，但这些判断与连贯性、相关性等潜在维度存在相关性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架可用于AI生成文本的检测和偏好评估任务，为理解影响质量判断的语言和风格因素提供新视角。

Abstract: AI "slop" is an increasingly popular term used to describe low-quality
AI-generated text, but there is currently no agreed upon definition of this
term nor a means to measure its occurrence. In this work, we develop a taxonomy
of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and
propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through
span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat)
subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent
dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to
evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks,
potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors
that contribute to quality judgments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过强化学习训练连续CoT的可扩展方法，无需从离散CoT蒸馏，在数学推理任务上取得了优于离散CoT的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连续token相比离散token具有更强的表达能力，但实际应用受到训练困难的限制，现有方法要么只在推理时使用连续token，要么需要从离散CoT蒸馏且计算成本高。

Method: 使用强化学习训练连续CoT，采用"软"token（token混合加输入嵌入噪声）进行RL探索，计算开销小，可训练数百个token的连续CoT。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上的数学推理基准测试中，连续CoT训练在pass@1上匹配离散CoT，在pass@32上超越离散CoT，显示出更大的CoT多样性。最佳方案是训练时使用连续CoT，推理时使用离散token。

Conclusion: 连续CoT RL训练能更好地保留基础模型在域外任务上的预测能力，为基座模型提供了更"温和"的调整方式。

Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the
intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a
superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results
have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and
can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of
continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous
works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained
discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth
discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few
tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs
via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete
CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input
embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,
enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning
benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs
match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing
greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario
is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,
meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show
continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model
on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

TL;DR: OPRL是一种用于智能体强化学习的通用信用分配策略，通过交替优化隐式过程奖励模型和策略，将轨迹偏好转化为隐式步骤奖励，解决了稀疏和不可验证奖励下的时间信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自主智能体在交互环境中进行长期推理和行动时，稀疏且有时不可验证的奖励使得时间信用分配极具挑战性。现有方法存在标注偏差、奖励攻击、方差过大等问题。

Method: OPRL交替优化隐式过程奖励模型和智能体策略，通过基于轨迹的DPO目标将轨迹偏好转化为隐式步骤奖励，然后结合结果奖励计算步骤级优势进行策略更新。

Result: 在WebShop、VisualSokoban和SOTOPIA三个不同智能体基准测试中，OPRL表现优于前沿LLM和强RL基线，实现了最先进的结果，具有更高的样本效率和更低的训练方差。

Conclusion: OPRL通过理论保证和实证验证，展示了在现实世界场景中智能体学习的潜力，能够实现高效探索和稳定训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in
interactive environments.
  However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit
assignment extremely challenging.
  Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but
suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly
fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.
  We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general
credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with
standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or
explicit step labels.
  In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with
the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step
rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.
  These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are
combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update,
creating a self-reinforcing loop.
  Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent
with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,
providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.
  Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including
WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with
unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.
  Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL
baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher
sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.
  Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using
fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafeCoDe是一个轻量级、模型无关的解码框架，通过对比解码和全局感知的token调制策略，动态调整多模态大语言模型的安全决策，平衡过敏感和欠敏感问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在安全决策上存在平衡问题，要么过度敏感（拒绝良性查询），要么不够敏感（漏检视觉风险），需要一种能根据多模态上下文动态调整安全决策的方法。

Method: SafeCoDe采用两阶段方法：1）对比解码机制，通过对比真实图像和高斯噪声图像来突出对视觉上下文敏感的token；2）全局感知的token调制策略，将场景级推理与token级调整结合，根据预测的安全判断自适应调整拒绝行为。

Result: 在多种MLLM架构和安全基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SafeCoDe能持续改进上下文敏感的拒绝行为，同时保持模型的有用性。

Conclusion: SafeCoDe有效解决了多模态大语言模型在安全对齐中的平衡问题，提供了一种轻量级且模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety
decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance
oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity
(missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in
safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive
Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that
dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe
operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights
tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised
images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates
scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according
to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM
architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity,
oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe
consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving
model helpfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于注意力的模型已成为临床笔记自然语言处理的主要方法，但需要比较不同预训练模型在电子健康记录信息提取任务上的性能差异。

Method: 使用Bert Base、BioBert、Bio+Clinical Bert变体、RoBerta和Clinical Longformer等预训练模型，在CMED数据集上进行微调，执行药物提取、医疗事件检测和多维药物事件上下文分类任务。

Result: 临床数据预训练的模型在药物和药物事件检测方面更有效，而Bert Base在药物相关事件上下文分类方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 不同预训练策略的模型在医疗NLP任务中各有优势，需要根据具体任务需求选择合适的模型。

Abstract: Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical
language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models
outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep-
resentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done
amongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two
variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task
related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks
from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges
(n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication
Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured
EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs.
The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting
contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using
data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED
to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and
multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods
are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied
models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on
constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics
including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models
pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and
medication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to
be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to
medications.

TL;DR: CompLLM是一种针对长上下文处理的软压缩技术，通过将上下文分段独立压缩，实现线性复杂度、可扩展性和可重用性，在保持性能的同时显著提升处理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM处理长上下文时面临二次复杂度的计算挑战，现有压缩方法将上下文作为整体处理导致压缩复杂度高且无法重用计算，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将上下文划分为多个段，对每个段独立进行软压缩，支持压缩段的缓存和跨查询重用。

Result: 在2倍压缩率下，CompLLM在高上下文长度时可将首token生成时间加速4倍，KV缓存减少50%，性能与未压缩上下文相当甚至在某些长序列上更优。

Conclusion: CompLLM通过分段压缩设计实现了高效、可扩展和可重用的长上下文处理，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when
processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.
While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent
representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited.
Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which
leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse
computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we
introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical
deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it
into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice
yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales
linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short
sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and
reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across
different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at
high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x
and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance
comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses
it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical
utility.

Abstract: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational
resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains
conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address
this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data
(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast
to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,
RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to
learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this
dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.
Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the
policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the
preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training
data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader
contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive
experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across
multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied
to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,
$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and
AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling
behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In
addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries
of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

<details>

Motivation: 概念空间在认知科学中被广泛使用，并有望成为可解释AI的基石，但目前缺乏从LLM中提取概念空间的实用方法。

Method: 提出使用原型描述来编码特征，并对LLM进行微调以对齐原型嵌入与概念空间维度。

Result: 经验分析表明该方法非常有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为从LLM中提取概念空间提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively
meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such
representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to
serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven
notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the
required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical
methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still
lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,
extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying
features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.
sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding
prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the
LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space
dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages like Slovak is
hindered by the scarcity of training data. To address this, we introduce
SloPalSpeech, a new, large-scale Slovak ASR dataset containing 2,806 hours of
speech from parliamentary proceedings. We developed a robust processing
pipeline to align and segment long-form recordings into clean, 30-second
audio-transcript pairs suitable for model training. We use this dataset to
fine-tune several OpenAI Whisper models (small, medium, large-v3, and
large-v3-turbo), achieving significant Word Error Rate (WER) reductions on
standard Slovak benchmarks like Common Voice and FLEURS. For instance, the
fine-tuned Whisper-small model's WER dropped by up to 70\%, approaching the
baseline performance of the much larger Whisper-large-v3 model. To foster
future research in low-resource speech recognition, we publicly release the

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years.
However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets,
which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high
rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written.
This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\%
of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is
actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To
tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset
(WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77
currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4
hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in
this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are
very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed
analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word
error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77
dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct
dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.

Abstract: We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual
benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the
cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks
with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage
across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and
union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The
dataset captures rich cultural themes including festivals, attire, cuisines,
art forms, and historical heritage amongst many more. We evaluate a wide range
of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models,
proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models,
across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key
limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded,
multimodal inputs, particularly for low-resource languages and less-documented
traditions. DRISHTIKON fills a vital gap in inclusive AI research, offering a
robust testbed to advance culturally aware, multimodally competent language

Motivation: 随着GAN和扩散模型的发展，深度伪造技术对数字安全、媒体完整性和公众信任的威胁日益增加，需要开发能够应对不断演变的深度伪造威胁的检测和预防方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习、Transformer零样本分类器、生成模型指纹识别、元学习等技术进行零样本检测，同时提出对抗性扰动、数字水印、实时AI监控和区块链验证等预防策略。

Result: 研究展示了零样本检测和预防方法的有效性，但也面临对抗性攻击、可扩展性限制、伦理困境和缺乏标准化评估基准等挑战。

Conclusion: 需要开发结合零样本学习和预防机制的综合防御框架，并强调AI研究人员、网络安全专家和政策制定者之间的跨学科合作对于构建抵御深度伪造攻击的弹性防御体系的重要性。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统辐射场方法牺牲了材质反射特性和光照条件的建模，导致几何歧义和无法进行重光照。现有方法在全局光照优化方面要么计算成本过高，要么采用简化方案导致精度不足。

Conclusion: 该框架在已知或未知光照条件的相对稀疏数据集上，通过定性和定量实验证明了其在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面的优越性能，为高效全局光照计算提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

*Pin-Yen Chiu,I-Sheng Fang,Jun-Cheng Chen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider是一个轻量级、高效的即插即用框架，通过在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现对视觉概念的连续控制，显著减少训练时间、GPU内存消耗和可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念控制方法需要大量训练时间和GPU内存来学习滑块或嵌入，且需要为不同的扩散主干网络重新训练，限制了其可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现连续概念控制，支持多概念组合和连续控制。

Result: Text Slider实现了平滑连续的属性调制，同时保持输入的空间布局和结构，训练速度比Concept Slider快5倍，比Attribute Control快47倍，GPU内存使用分别减少近2倍和4倍。

Conclusion: Text Slider是一个高效、轻量级的概念控制框架，显著提升了训练效率和资源利用率，支持图像和视频合成中的精细灵活控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

*Jun Ma,Qian He,Gaofeng He,Huang Chen,Chen Liu,Xiaogang Jin,Huamin Wang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的框架，用于细粒度风格迁移，特别针对刺绣等复杂纹理特征，通过单张参考图像实现风格和内容的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格迁移方法在处理刺绣等具有复杂针迹图案和材料特性的细粒度视觉特征时面临挑战，需要更精细的风格控制能力。

Method: 采用两阶段对比学习LoRA调制技术：第一阶段迭代更新整个LoRA和选定的风格块来初步分离风格与内容；第二阶段通过自知识蒸馏的对比学习策略进一步解耦风格和内容。

Result: 在刺绣定制基准测试中超越现有方法，并在艺术风格迁移、素描上色和外观迁移三个额外领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为细粒度视觉特征迁移提供了有效解决方案，在零售预可视化等应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.

### [188] [A Cost-Benefit Analysis of On-Premise Large Language Model Deployment: Breaking Even with Commercial LLM Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18101)
*Guanzhong Pan,Haibo Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出一个成本效益分析框架，帮助企业决定何时本地部署开源LLM比商业订阅服务更经济可行


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业在使用AI时面临选择：订阅商业LLM服务或本地部署。虽然云服务提供先进模型和易扩展性，但数据隐私、供应商锁定和长期成本问题推动了本地部署的需求

Method: 分析最新开源模型（如Qwen、Llama、Mistral等）的硬件需求、运营成本和性能基准，并与主要云服务商的订阅费用进行对比

Result: 研究提供了基于使用水平和性能需求的盈亏平衡点估算

Conclusion: 这些结果为组织规划LLM策略提供了实用框架

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly widespread.
Organizations that want to use AI for productivity now face an important
decision. They can subscribe to commercial LLM services or deploy models on
their own infrastructure. Cloud services from providers such as OpenAI,
Anthropic, and Google are attractive because they provide easy access to
state-of-the-art models and are easy to scale. However, concerns about data
privacy, the difficulty of switching service providers, and long-term operating
costs have driven interest in local deployment of open-source models. This
paper presents a cost-benefit analysis framework to help organizations
determine when on-premise LLM deployment becomes economically viable compared
to commercial subscription services. We consider the hardware requirements,
operational expenses, and performance benchmarks of the latest open-source
models, including Qwen, Llama, Mistral, and etc. Then we compare the total cost
of deploying these models locally with the major cloud providers subscription
fee. Our findings provide an estimated breakeven point based on usage levels
and performance needs. These results give organizations a practical framework
for planning their LLM strategies.

TL;DR: SPADE是一个基于大语言模型的土壤湿度时间序列分析框架，能够联合检测灌溉模式和异常，无需任务特定标注或微调即可实现零样本分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有土壤湿度时间序列分析方法要么依赖基于阈值的规则，要么使用数据需求大的机器学习或深度学习模型，存在适应性和可解释性限制。

Method: 利用ChatGPT-4.1的推理能力，将时间序列数据转换为文本表示，通过领域知识设计的提示模板识别灌溉事件、估计净灌溉增益、检测和分类异常，并生成结构化可解释报告。

Result: 在美国多个商业和实验农场的真实土壤湿度传感器数据上测试，SPADE在异常检测方面优于现有方法，获得更高的召回率和F1分数，并能准确分类异常类型；在灌溉事件检测方面达到高精度和召回率。

Conclusion: 该研究突显了LLMs作为精准农业可扩展、适应性工具的潜力，能够整合定性知识和数据驱动推理，为准确土壤湿度监测和改进灌溉调度提供可行见解。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of soil moisture patterns is critical for irrigation
scheduling and crop management, yet existing approaches for soil moisture
time-series analysis either rely on threshold-based rules or data-hungry
machine learning or deep learning models that are limited in adaptability and
interpretability. In this study, we introduce SPADE (Soil moisture Pattern and
Anomaly DEtection), an integrated framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to jointly detect irrigation patterns and anomalies in soil
moisture time-series data. SPADE utilizes ChatGPT-4.1 for its advanced
reasoning and instruction-following capabilities, enabling zero-shot analysis
without requiring task-specific annotation or fine-tuning. By converting
time-series data into a textual representation and designing domain-informed
prompt templates, SPADE identifies irrigation events, estimates net irrigation
gains, detects, classifies anomalies, and produces structured, interpretable
reports. Experiments were conducted on real-world soil moisture sensor data
from commercial and experimental farms cultivating multiple crops across the
United States. Results demonstrate that SPADE outperforms the existing method
in anomaly detection, achieving higher recall and F1 scores and accurately
classifying anomaly types. Furthermore, SPADE achieved high precision and
recall in detecting irrigation events, indicating its strong capability to
capture irrigation patterns accurately. SPADE's reports provide
interpretability and usability of soil moisture analytics. This study
highlights the potential of LLMs as scalable, adaptable tools for precision
agriculture, which is capable of integrating qualitative knowledge and
data-driven reasoning to produce actionable insights for accurate soil moisture
monitoring and improved irrigation scheduling from soil moisture time-series
data.

### [190] [Position Paper: Integrating Explainability and Uncertainty Estimation in Medical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18132)
*Xiuyi Fan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了可解释不确定性估计（XUE）框架，将可解释性与不确定性量化相结合，以增强医疗AI的可信度和可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医疗AI系统未能以符合临床推理的方式明确量化或传达不确定性，现有可解释AI（XAI）工作缺乏对预测置信度的捕捉，而不确定性估计（UE）技术又缺乏直观解释，这种脱节限制了AI在医学领域的应用。

Method: 提出XUE框架，系统地将医学不确定性映射到AI不确定性概念，识别XUE实施的关键挑战，并规划技术发展方向，包括多模态不确定性量化、模型无关的可视化技术和不确定性感知决策支持系统。

Result: 分析强调了AI系统不仅需要生成可靠预测，还需要以临床有意义的方式表达置信水平的必要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过桥接可解释性和不确定性，为开发可信赖的医疗AI做出贡献，为符合现实世界临床复杂性的AI系统铺平道路。

Abstract: Uncertainty is a fundamental challenge in medical practice, but current
medical AI systems fail to explicitly quantify or communicate uncertainty in a
way that aligns with clinical reasoning. Existing XAI works focus on
interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability
of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques
provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect
between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we
propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability
with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI.
We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and
identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions
for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification,
model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support
systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE
realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only
generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a
clinically meaningful way. This work contributes to the development of
trustworthy medical AI by bridging explainability and uncertainty, paving the
way for AI systems that are aligned with real-world clinical complexities.

*Dong Liu,Yanxuan Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HSGM框架通过分层分段图记忆机制，将长文档分解为有意义片段，构建局部语义图和全局图记忆，显著降低长文档语义解析的计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长文档语义解析中二次复杂度增长和内存需求过高的问题，实现超长文本的可扩展语义建模。

Method: 将输入文档分解为M个片段，在每个片段上构建局部语义图，提取摘要节点形成全局图记忆，支持增量更新和分层查询处理。

Result: 理论复杂度从O(N²)降至O(Nk + (N/k)²)，在三个基准测试中实现2-4倍推理加速、>60%内存减少，保持≥95%基线准确率。

Conclusion: HSGM为超长文本提供了可扩展、准确的语义建模方案，支持实时和资源受限的NLP应用。

Abstract: Semantic parsing of long documents remains challenging due to quadratic
growth in pairwise composition and memory requirements. We introduce
\textbf{Hierarchical Segment-Graph Memory (HSGM)}, a novel framework that
decomposes an input of length $N$ into $M$ meaningful segments, constructs
\emph{Local Semantic Graphs} on each segment, and extracts compact
\emph{summary nodes} to form a \emph{Global Graph Memory}. HSGM supports
\emph{incremental updates} -- only newly arrived segments incur local graph
construction and summary-node integration -- while \emph{Hierarchical Query
Processing} locates relevant segments via top-$K$ retrieval over summary nodes
and then performs fine-grained reasoning within their local graphs.
  Theoretically, HSGM reduces worst-case complexity from $O(N^2)$ to
$O\!\left(N\,k + (N/k)^2\right)$, with segment size $k \ll N$, and we derive
Frobenius-norm bounds on the approximation error introduced by node
summarization and sparsification thresholds. Empirically, on three benchmarks
-- long-document AMR parsing, segment-level semantic role labeling (OntoNotes),
and legal event extraction -- HSGM achieves \emph{2--4$\times$ inference
speedup}, \emph{$>60\%$ reduction} in peak memory, and \emph{$\ge 95\%$} of
baseline accuracy. Our approach unlocks scalable, accurate semantic modeling
for ultra-long texts, enabling real-time and resource-constrained NLP
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Foam-Agent是一个多智能体框架，通过单一自然语言提示自动化整个OpenFOAM工作流程，显著降低CFD仿真的技术门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算流体动力学(CFD)仿真的学习曲线陡峭且设置复杂，现有系统存在功能局限，需要开发能够自动化完整端到端工作流程的解决方案。

Method: 采用多智能体架构，包括网格生成代理、HPC脚本自动生成和可视化处理；使用模型上下文协议(MCP)实现可组合服务架构；通过分层多索引RAG实现高精度配置生成。

Result: 在110个仿真任务基准测试中，Foam-Agent达到88.2%的成功率，显著优于现有框架(MetaOpenFOAM的55.5%)。

Conclusion: Foam-Agent有效降低了CFD的专业门槛，展示了专用多智能体系统如何民主化复杂科学计算。

Abstract: Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in
engineering, yet its steep learning curve and complex manual setup create
significant barriers. To address these challenges, we introduce Foam-Agent, a
multi-agent framework that automates the entire end-to-end OpenFOAM workflow
from a single natural language prompt. Our key innovations address critical
gaps in existing systems: 1. An Comprehensive End-to-End Simulation Automation:
Foam-Agent is the first system to manage the full simulation pipeline,
including advanced pre-processing with a versatile Meshing Agent capable of
handling external mesh files and generating new geometries via Gmsh, automatic
generation of HPC submission scripts, and post-simulation visualization via
ParaView. 2. Composable Service Architecture: Going beyond a monolithic agent,
the framework uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose its core functions as
discrete, callable tools. This allows for flexible integration and use by other
agentic systems, such as Claude-code, for more exploratory workflows. 3.
High-Fidelity Configuration Generation: We achieve superior accuracy through a
Hierarchical Multi-Index RAG for precise context retrieval and a
dependency-aware generation process that ensures configuration consistency.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 88.2%
success rate with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing
frameworks (55.5% for MetaOpenFOAM). Foam-Agent dramatically lowers the
expertise barrier for CFD, demonstrating how specialized multi-agent systems
can democratize complex scientific computing. The code is public at

*Yang Wang,Kai Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了将大语言模型（LLMs）集成到运筹学（OR）中的最新进展，主要涵盖自动建模、辅助优化和直接求解三个方向，并讨论了评估基准、应用领域及未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运筹学方法在处理大规模、动态和多约束问题时面临挑战，而大语言模型通过语义理解、结构化生成和推理控制显示出解决这些问题的潜力。

Method: 将LLMs集成到OR的方法分为三类：自动建模（将自然语言描述转化为数学模型或可执行代码）、辅助优化（生成启发式算法和演化算法）以及直接求解优化任务。

Result: LLMs在OR中的应用已取得初步进展，但仍存在语义到结构映射不稳定、研究进展碎片化、泛化能力有限和评估体系不足等问题。

Conclusion: 本文总结了LLMs在OR中的关键开放问题，并展望了未来的研究方向，以推动LLMs在OR中的进一步应用。

Abstract: Operations research (OR) provides fundamental methodologies for complex
system decision-making, with established applications in transportation, supply
chain management, and production scheduling. Traditional approaches, which
depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face
challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems.
Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these
limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and
reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into
mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms,
and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on
the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions:
automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further
reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes
key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented
research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems.
Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role
of LLMs in OR.

*Mustafa Sameen,Xiaojian Zhang,Xilei Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了SAPA框架，使用大型语言模型合成理论驱动的潜在态度来预测网约车选择模式，解决了现有模型预测精度不足和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网约车选择预测模型由于无法捕捉关键心理因素而预测精度有限，且面临严重的类别不平衡问题（网约车出行仅占日常出行的小部分）。

Method: SAPA框架采用分层方法：1）使用LLM从原始旅行调查数据生成定性旅行者画像；2）训练倾向得分模型；3）LLM为理论驱动的潜在变量分配定量分数；4）最终分类器整合倾向得分、潜在变量分数和可观察出行属性。

Result: 在大规模多年旅行调查上的实验表明，SAPA显著优于最先进的基线方法，在测试集上的PR-AUC指标将网约车选择预测提高了75.9%。

Conclusion: SAPA为准确预测网约车选择模式提供了强大工具，其方法论可轻松迁移到各种应用中。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of ridesourcing mode choices is essential for designing and
implementing effective traffic management policies for reducing congestion,
improving mobility, and allocating resources more efficiently. Existing models
for predicting ridesourcing mode choices often suffer from limited predictive
accuracy due to their inability to capture key psychological factors, and are
further challenged by severe class imbalance, as ridesourcing trips comprise
only a small fraction of individuals' daily travel. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Synthesizing Attitudes, Predicting
Actions (SAPA) framework, a hierarchical approach that uses Large Language
Models (LLMs) to synthesize theory-grounded latent attitudes to predict
ridesourcing choices. SAPA first uses an LLM to generate qualitative traveler
personas from raw travel survey data and then trains a propensity-score model
on demographic and behavioral features, enriched by those personas, to produce
an individual-level score. Next, the LLM assigns quantitative scores to
theory-driven latent variables (e.g., time and cost sensitivity), and a final
classifier integrates the propensity score, latent-variable scores (with their
interaction terms), and observable trip attributes to predict ridesourcing mode
choice. Experiments on a large-scale, multi-year travel survey show that SAPA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ridesourcing
choice predictions by up to 75.9% in terms of PR-AUC on a held-out test set.
This study provides a powerful tool for accurately predicting ridesourcing mode
choices, and provides a methodology that is readily transferable to various
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OBER是一个基于学习成果的教育推荐系统，通过将学习成果和评估项目嵌入数据模式，使任何推荐算法都能根据其促进的掌握程度进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数教育推荐系统仅基于点击或评分相关性进行调优和判断，其真实的教学影响不明确。需要一种能够直接评估推荐系统对学习成果影响的方法。

Method: OBER采用极简的实体关系模型、日志驱动的掌握度公式和插件架构，在非正式学习领域的电子学习系统中进行了为期两周的随机分组测试，比较了固定专家路径、协同过滤和基于知识的过滤三种方法。

Result: 协同过滤最大化了用户留存率，但固定路径实现了最高的掌握度。OBER可以从相同的日志中得出业务、相关性和学习指标，让从业者能够权衡相关性和参与度与成果掌握度。

Conclusion: OBER框架是方法无关的，易于扩展到未来的自适应或情境感知推荐系统，为教育推荐系统的真实教学效果评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Most educational recommender systems are tuned and judged on click- or
rating-based relevance, leaving their true pedagogical impact unclear. We
introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning
outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm
can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist
entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in
architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was
evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners
across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF),
and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path
achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and
learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and
engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The
framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or
context-aware recommenders.

TL;DR: 提出了MMCD框架，通过多模态协同决策和跨模态知识蒸馏解决自动驾驶中传感器故障或连接车辆缺失的问题，提升驾驶安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在事故易发环境中面临挑战，单个车辆传感器范围有限且视野受阻。现有方法假设训练和测试时所有数据模态和连接车辆都可用，这不切实际。

Method: MMCD框架融合自车和协同车辆的多模态观测数据，采用基于教师-学生模型的跨模态知识蒸馏方法，教师模型使用多模态数据训练，学生模型在模态减少时仍能有效运行。

Result: 在连接自动驾驶和空地车辆协作实验中，该方法将驾驶安全性提高了20.7%，在潜在事故检测和安全驾驶决策方面超越了现有最佳基线。

Conclusion: MMCD框架通过多模态协同和知识蒸馏技术，有效提升了自动驾驶系统在现实复杂环境中的鲁棒性和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in
accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single
vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of
accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches,
leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising
solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data
modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is
impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To
address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal
Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses
multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance
decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when
certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach
based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model
structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while
the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities.
In experiments on $\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$
and $\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves
driving safety by up to ${\it 20.7}\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline
in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions. More

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态的论证系统中，当QBAF更新后，参数强度的相对顺序可能发生变化（强度不一致性）。理解这些变化的原因对于系统透明度和可信度至关重要，但目前缺乏系统化的解释方法。

Method: 定义了强度不一致性的充分、必要和反事实解释，证明了强度不一致性解释存在的充要条件。提出了基于启发式的方法来促进强度不一致性解释的搜索，并提供了实现。

Result: 建立了强度不一致性解释的理论框架，证明了解释存在的条件，开发了有效的搜索算法和实现工具。

Conclusion: 该方法为QBAF中的推理变化提供了系统化的解释机制，增强了动态论证系统的可解释性和透明度，为实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents a formal approach to explaining change of inference in
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs). When drawing conclusions
from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on),
our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the
partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some
arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength
inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We
identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength
inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and
only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based
approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for
which we also provide an implementation.

TL;DR: 提出了Neural DNA（nDNA）作为捕捉AI基础模型潜在认知身份的语义-基因型表示，通过内在几何结构来表征模型的认知特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试只能衡量模型行为，但模型的本质在于其潜在几何结构。需要一种能够捕捉模型内在认知身份的方法，类似于生物DNA编码遗传信息。

Method: nDNA基于三个几何维度构建：谱曲率（揭示概念流动的曲率）、热力学长度（量化语义转换所需的努力）和信念矢量场（描述模型信念方向导向的语义扭转场）。

Result: nDNA能够稳定地指纹化模型，用于追踪预训练、微调、对齐等过程中的谱系关系，测量检查点间的继承性，检测数据或目标变化下的漂移。

Conclusion: 这项工作开启了神经基因组学新领域，将AI模型视为具有可追溯内在认知的数字语义有机体，为比较模型、诊断风险和治理认知演化提供了新方法。

Abstract: As AI foundation models grow in capability, a deeper question emerges: What
shapes their internal cognitive identity -- beyond fluency and output?
Benchmarks measure behavior, but the soul of a model resides in its latent
geometry. In this work, we propose Neural DNA (nDNA) as a semantic-genotypic
representation that captures this latent identity through the intrinsic
geometry of belief. At its core, nDNA is synthesized from three principled and
indispensable dimensions of latent geometry: spectral curvature, which reveals
the curvature of conceptual flow across layers; thermodynamic length, which
quantifies the semantic effort required to traverse representational
transitions through layers; and belief vector field, which delineates the
semantic torsion fields that guide a model's belief directional orientations.
Like biological DNA, it encodes ancestry, mutation, and semantic inheritance,
found in finetuning and alignment scars, cultural imprints, and architectural
drift. In naming it, we open a new field: Neural Genomics, where models are not
just tools, but digital semantic organisms with traceable inner cognition.
  Modeling statement. We read AI foundation models as semantic fluid--dynamics:
meaning is transported through layers like fluid in a shaped conduit; nDNA is
the physics-grade readout of that flow -- a geometry-first measure of how
meaning is bent, paid for, and pushed -- yielding a stable, coordinate-free
neural DNA fingerprint tied to on-input behavior; with this fingerprint we
cross into biology: tracing lineages across pretraining, fine-tuning,
alignment, pruning, distillation, and merges; measuring inheritance between
checkpoints; detecting drift as traits shift under new data or objectives; and,
ultimately, studying the evolution of artificial cognition to compare models,
diagnose risks, and govern change over time.

TL;DR: 本文提出了相似性场理论，这是一个数学框架，用于形式化实体间相似性关系及其演化的原理。该理论定义了相似性场、系统演化、概念纤维和生成算子，并基于此形式化了智能的生成定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者认为持久化和转换相似性关系构成了任何可理解动态系统的结构基础。需要建立一个数学框架来形式化相似性值及其演化的原理，为描述、比较和构建智能系统提供基础语言。

Method: 定义了相似性场S:U×U→[0,1]，满足自反性但允许不对称性和非传递性；系统演化序列Zp=(Xp,S(p))；概念K诱导纤维Fα(K)；生成算子G。通过证明两个定理来约束相似性场演化的可解释性。

Result: 证明了两个关键定理：(i)不对称性阻止相互包含；(ii)稳定性需要锚定坐标或最终限制在f的水平集内。这些结果确保了相似性场演化的约束性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 相似性场理论为表征、比较和构建智能系统提供了基础语言框架，并展示了如何用该框架解释大语言模型，将其作为探究社会认知的实验工具。

Abstract: We posit that persisting and transforming similarity relations form the
structural basis of any comprehensible dynamic system. This paper introduces
Similarity Field Theory, a mathematical framework that formalizes the
principles governing similarity values among entities and their evolution. We
define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \times U \to [0,1]$ over a universe of
entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed
relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the
evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by
$p=0,1,2,\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers
$F_{\alpha}(K) = { E \in U \mid S(E,K) \ge \alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of
the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that
produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative
definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a
concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of
$K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field
Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and
constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks
mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or
eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the
evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable,
culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large
language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.

*Dingxin Lu,Shurui Wu,Xinyi Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VL-RiskFormer是一个用于预测个体健康风险的多模态AI框架，结合视觉和语言数据，在MIMIC-IV数据集上取得了0.90的AUROC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着慢性疾病负担增加和多模态临床数据的涌现，需要统一的AI框架来主动预测个体健康风险。

Method: 采用分层堆叠的视觉-语言多模态Transformer架构，包含四个关键创新：跨模态预训练、时间融合块、疾病本体图适配器和LLM推理头。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV纵向队列中，平均AUROC达到0.90，预期校准误差为2.7%。

Conclusion: VL-RiskFormer展示了在多模态临床数据上进行健康风险预测的有效性，为个性化医疗提供了有力工具。

Abstract: With the rising global burden of chronic diseases and the multimodal and
heterogeneous clinical data (medical imaging, free-text recordings, wearable
sensor streams, etc.), there is an urgent need for a unified multimodal AI
framework that can proactively predict individual health risks. We propose
VL-RiskFormer, a hierarchical stacked visual-language multimodal Transformer
with a large language model (LLM) inference head embedded in its top layer. The
system builds on the dual-stream architecture of existing visual-linguistic
models (e.g., PaLM-E, LLaVA) with four key innovations: (i) pre-training with
cross-modal comparison and fine-grained alignment of radiological images,
fundus maps, and wearable device photos with corresponding clinical narratives
using momentum update encoders and debiased InfoNCE losses; (ii) a time fusion
block that integrates irregular visit sequences into the causal Transformer
decoder through adaptive time interval position coding; (iii) a disease
ontology map adapter that injects ICD-10 codes into visual and textual channels
in layers and infers comorbid patterns with the help of a graph attention
mechanism. On the MIMIC-IV longitudinal cohort, VL-RiskFormer achieved an
average AUROC of 0.90 with an expected calibration error of 2.7 percent.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChefMind是一个混合架构，结合了探索链、知识图谱、检索增强生成和大型语言模型，用于解决个性化食谱推荐中的模糊意图、语义准确性和细节覆盖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化食谱推荐面临处理模糊用户意图、确保语义准确性和提供足够细节覆盖的挑战。

Method: 提出ChefMind混合架构，包含探索链（CoE）用于将模糊查询转化为结构化条件，知识图谱（KG）提供语义推理和可解释性，检索增强生成（RAG）补充上下文烹饪细节，大型语言模型（LLM）整合输出生成连贯推荐。

Result: 在Xiachufang数据集和手动标注查询上评估，ChefMind在准确性、相关性、完整性和清晰度方面表现优异，平均得分8.7，而消融模型得分6.4-6.7。未处理查询减少至1.6%，显示出处理模糊需求的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ChefMind通过混合架构有效解决了食谱推荐中的关键挑战，在多个指标上显著优于单一方法基线。

Abstract: Personalized recipe recommendation faces challenges in handling fuzzy user

KG offers semantic reasoning and interpretability, RAG supplements contextual
culinary details, and LLM integrates outputs into coherent recommendations. We
evaluate ChefMind on the Xiachufang dataset and manually annotated queries,
comparing it with LLM-only, KG-only, and RAG-only baselines. Results show that
ChefMind achieves superior performance in accuracy, relevance, completeness,
and clarity, with an average score of 8.7 versus 6.4-6.7 for ablation models.
Moreover, it reduces unprocessed queries to 1.6%, demonstrating robustness in

### [202] [An N-Plus-1 GPT Agency for Critical Solution of Mechanical Engineering Analysis Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18229)
*Anthony Patera,Rohan Abeyaratne*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种"N+1"GPT代理机构，用于机械工程问题的初步分析，通过多个独立求解代理和比较代理来提高GPT在工程问题求解中的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPT在机械工程分析中虽然能产生优秀解决方案，但存在不可靠性（成功率仅85%），不适合直接用于教育或工程实践。需要一种机制来提高解决方案的可靠性。

Method: 采用"N+1"代理架构：首先启动N个独立求解代理生成N个解决方案，然后通过比较代理汇总比较这些方案并推荐最优解。基于孔多塞陪审团定理，当每个求解代理成功率大于1/2且N足够大时，多数方案大概率是正确的。

Result: 该方法能显著提高解决方案的可靠性，比较代理还能整合不同的问题解释和数学建模方法。与Grok Heavy等商业多代理模型相比，该方法更注重透明度和教学价值。

Conclusion: "N+1"GPT代理机构为机械工程问题分析提供了一种可靠的低成本解决方案，特别适合教育应用，通过多代理协作提高了GPT在专业领域的实用性。

Abstract: Generative AI, and specifically GPT, can produce a remarkable solution to a
mechanical engineering analysis problem - but also, on occasion, a flawed
solution. For example, an elementary mechanics problem is solved flawlessly in
one GPT instance and incorrectly in a subsequent GPT instance, with a success
probability of only 85%. This unreliability renders "out-of-the-box" GPT
unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice. We introduce an
"N-Plus-1" GPT Agency for Initial (Low-Cost) Analysis of mechanical engineering
Problem Statements. Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to
yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes
Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution
Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from
Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by
per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the
Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high
probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore,
Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare)
Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative
Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or
alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures. Comparisons to Grok Heavy, a
commercial multi-agent model, show similarities in design and performance, but
also important differences in emphasis: our Agency focuses on transparency and
pedagogical value.

*Zihan Dong,Xinyu Fan,Zixiang Tang,Yunqing Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级分层强化学习框架ComputerAgent，用于桌面应用控制，相比大型多模态语言模型具有更小的模型尺寸和更快的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于多模态大语言模型的桌面应用控制方法存在推理延迟高、样本效率低、无法在设备上部署等问题，需要更实用的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层强化学习框架，包含管理器和子策略的两级选项过程，使用三模态状态编码器（截图、任务ID、数值状态），集成元动作和早停机制，采用紧凑的视觉骨干网络和小型策略网络。

Result: 在135个真实桌面任务测试中，简单任务成功率92.1%，困难任务成功率58.8%，模型参数仅1500万，推理时间减半，性能媲美2000亿参数的大模型。

Conclusion: 分层强化学习为计算机控制提供了一种实用、可扩展的替代方案，优于基于单体大模型的自动化方法。

Abstract: Controlling desktop applications via software remains a fundamental yet
under-served problem. Existing multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) ingest
screenshots and task instructions to generate keystrokes and mouse events, but
they suffer from prohibitive inference latency, poor sample efficiency on
long-horizon sparse-reward tasks, and infeasible on-device deployment. We
introduce a lightweight hierarchical reinforcement learning framework,
ComputerAgent, that formulates OS control as a two-level option process
(manager and subpolicy), employs a triple-modal state encoder (screenshot, task
ID, numeric state) to handle visual and contextual diversity, integrates
meta-actions with an early-stop mechanism to reduce wasted interactions, and
uses a compact vision backbone plus small policy networks for on-device
inference (15M parameters). On a suite of 135 real-world desktop tasks,
ComputerAgent attains 92.1% success on simple tasks (<8 steps) and 58.8% on
hard tasks (>=8 steps), matching or exceeding 200B-parameter MLLM baselines on
simple scenarios while reducing model size by over four orders of magnitude and
halving inference time. These results demonstrate that hierarchical RL offers a
practical, scalable alternative to monolithic MLLM-based automation for
computer control.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文指出当前医学AI基准测试存在严重问题，大型前沿模型虽然在基准测试中得分很高，但实际上表现出脆弱性、走捷径学习和缺乏真正的医学理解。通过压力测试发现，这些模型会在关键输入被移除时仍然猜对答案，在轻微提示变化下改变回答，并编造有说服力但有缺陷的推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前医学AI基准测试的局限性，证明高基准分数并不能真实反映模型在现实医疗环境中的准备程度，呼吁需要更严格的评估标准来确保AI在医疗领域的可靠性和安全性。

Method: 评估了六个旗舰模型在六个广泛使用的医学基准上的表现，采用临床医生指导的评分标准评估，进行压力测试包括移除关键输入、改变提示等方式来测试模型的稳健性。

Result: 发现领先系统存在严重的脆弱性和走捷径学习问题，基准测试之间测量内容差异很大但被等同对待，高基准分数掩盖了失败模式。

Conclusion: 医学基准测试分数不能直接反映现实世界的准备程度，要建立医疗AI的信任需要超越基准测试胜利，要求系统具备稳健性、合理推理能力以及与真实医疗需求的一致性。

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了两种计算约束策略（推理长度约束和模型量化）来降低推理模型的计算需求，并研究其对模型安全性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试时计算扩展虽然能通过生成长链思维序列提高推理语言模型性能，但计算成本显著增加。需要找到在保持性能的同时降低计算需求的方法。

Method: 1）使用基于长度控制策略优化的强化学习方法微调推理模型以满足用户定义的推理长度；2）应用量化技术，在用户定义的计算约束内最大化链思维序列的生成。

Result: 研究了计算效率与模型安全性之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 提出了两种有效的计算约束方法，为在保持模型性能的同时降低计算成本提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Test-time compute scaling has demonstrated the ability to improve the
performance of reasoning language models by generating longer chain-of-thought
(CoT) sequences. However, this increase in performance comes with a significant
increase in computational cost. In this work, we investigate two compute
constraint strategies: (1) reasoning length constraint and (2) model
quantization, as methods to reduce the compute demand of reasoning models and
study their impact on their safety performance. Specifically, we explore two
approaches to apply compute constraints to reasoning models: (1) fine-tuning
reasoning models using a length controlled policy optimization (LCPO) based
reinforcement learning method to satisfy a user-defined CoT reasoning length,
and (2) applying quantization to maximize the generation of CoT sequences
within a user-defined compute constraint. Furthermore, we study the trade-off
between the computational efficiency and the safety of the model.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了Gödel测试，评估大型语言模型能否为简单未解数学猜想生成正确证明，并在组合优化领域测试了GPT-5的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前沿AI模型在数学竞赛中表现优异，但能否解决更高级数学领域的新简单猜想仍不清楚，因此需要评估模型在原创数学推理方面的能力。

Method: 选择五个组合优化猜想，提供相关论文但不透露猜想本身，详细评估GPT-5的推理过程。

Result: 在三个较简单问题上GPT-5几乎给出正确解；问题2中甚至推翻了原猜想并给出有效解；问题4（需跨论文综合）失败；问题5提出正确算法但分析失败。

Conclusion: GPT-5在常规推理上有进步，偶现原创性，但跨论文综合能力有限，可能是通过Gödel测试的早期步骤。

Abstract: Recent announcements from frontier AI model labs have highlighted strong
results on high-school and undergraduate math competitions. Yet it remains
unclear whether large language models can solve new, simple conjectures in more
advanced areas of mathematics. We propose the G\"odel Test: evaluating whether
a model can produce correct proofs for very simple, previously unsolved
conjectures. To this end, we study the performance of GPT-5 on five conjectures
in combinatorial optimization. For each problem, we provided one or two source
papers from which the conjecture arose, withheld our own conjecture, and then
assessed the model's reasoning in detail. On the three easier problems, GPT-5
produced nearly correct solutions; for Problem 2 it even derived a different
approximation guarantee that, upon checking, refuted our conjecture while
providing a valid solution. The model failed on Problem 4, which required
combining results from two papers. On Problem 5, a harder case without a
validated conjecture, GPT-5 proposed the same algorithm we had in mind but
failed in the analysis, suggesting the proof is more challenging than expected.
Although our sample is small, the results point to meaningful progress on
routine reasoning, occasional flashes of originality, and clear limitations
when cross-paper synthesis is required. GPT-5 may represent an early step
toward frontier models eventually passing the G\"odel Test.

### [207] [ATLAS: Benchmarking and Adapting LLMs for Global Trade via Harmonized Tariff Code Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18400)
*Pritish Yuvraj,Siva Devarakonda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个基于美国海关CROSS系统的HTS编码分类基准，并开发了Atlas模型（基于LLaMA-3.3-70B微调），在10位编码分类上达到40%准确率，比GPT-5-Thinking和Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking分别提升15和27.5个百分点，且成本显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HTS编码分类是全球贸易中的关键瓶颈，但机器学习社区对此关注不足。分类错误可能导致货物运输完全中断，已有主要邮政运营商因海关文件不完整而暂停对美送货。

Method: 基于美国海关CROSS系统构建首个HTS编码分类基准数据集，对领先的LLM进行评估，并微调LLaMA-3.3-70B模型（命名为Atlas）进行HTS编码分类。

Result: Atlas模型在10位HTS编码分类上达到40%准确率，6位编码分类达到57.5%准确率，比GPT-5-Thinking和Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking分别提升15和27.5个百分点，成本降低5-8倍，且支持自托管保证数据隐私。

Conclusion: Atlas模型为HTS分类设立了强有力的基线，但该任务仍极具挑战性（仅40%的10位编码准确率）。通过发布数据集和模型，旨在将HTS分类确立为新的社区基准任务，促进检索、推理和对齐方面的未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule
(HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little
attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt
shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the
U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark
for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online
Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned
Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit
classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements
of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking.
Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and
eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to
guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While
Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with
only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim
to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite
future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.

TL;DR: IFEval-FC是一个新的函数调用基准测试，专注于评估大语言模型对参数描述中格式指令的遵循能力，填补了现有基准测试的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试如BFCL、tau^2-Bench和ACEBench只评估参数正确性，但不测试对格式指令（如双引号、ISO日期格式等）的遵循能力，这在现实AI代理系统中至关重要。

Method: IFEval-FC在JSON schema描述中直接编码可验证的格式要求，包含750个测试用例，每个用例包含一个函数及其输入参数的格式要求，以及对应的用户查询。评估完全基于算法，确保客观性和可复现性。

Result: 结果显示，即使是GPT-5和Claude 4.1 Opus等最先进的专有模型也经常无法遵循基本的格式规则，揭示了现实世界代理系统的实际局限性。

Conclusion: IFEval-FC基准测试突显了大语言模型在精确遵循格式指令方面的不足，为改进函数调用能力提供了重要工具和数据集。

Abstract: Function calling is a core capability of large language models, essential for
AI agents. Existing benchmarks such as the Berkeley Function Calling
Leaderboard (BFCL), tau^2-Bench (arXiv:2506.07982), and ACEBench
(arXiv:2501.12851) evaluate argument correctness but do not test adherence to
format instructions embedded in parameter descriptions, such as enclosing
values in double quotes or using ISO date formats.
  We introduce IFEval-FC, a benchmark inspired by IFEval (arXiv:2311.07911)
that assesses precise instruction following in function calling. IFEval-FC
encodes verifiable formats directly within JSON schema descriptions, for
example specifying that a value must not contain punctuation. It includes 750
test cases, each consisting of a function with an embedded format for one of
its input parameters and a corresponding user query. Evaluation is fully
algorithmic, ensuring objectivity, reproducibility, and scalability.
  Our results show that even state-of-the-art proprietary models, including
GPT-5 and Claude 4.1 Opus, frequently fail to follow basic formatting rules,
highlighting a practical limitation for real-world agent systems. The complete
codebase and data are publicly available at

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，Pensieve相比最先进方法在问答准确率上提升高达14%。

Conclusion: Pensieve管道有效解决了Memory-QA任务的独特挑战，为基于视觉记忆的问答系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Memory-QA, a novel real-world task that involves answering
recall questions about visual content from previously stored multimodal
memories. This task poses unique challenges, including the creation of
task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location
information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to
answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,
time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA
fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real
challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over
state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 击剑运动面临裁判主观判断、人为错误、偏见以及训练环境中裁判资源有限等问题，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 系统从视频中提取2D关节位置，计算101维运动学特征，使用Transformer进行多标签动作分类，并结合基于规则的推理来确定优先权和得分。

Result: 在5折交叉验证中，平均macro-F1得分为0.549，优于Temporal Convolutional Network、BiLSTM和普通Transformer等基线模型。

Conclusion: 虽然尚未达到部署标准，但结果表明这是实现击剑自动化裁判辅助的有前景路径，并为AI在击剑领域的应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: The sport of fencing, like many other sports, faces challenges in refereeing:
subjective calls, human errors, bias, and limited availability in practice
environments. We present FERA (Fencing Referee Assistant), a prototype AI
referee for foil fencing which integrates pose-based multi-label action
recognition and rule-based reasoning. FERA extracts 2D joint positions from
video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and
applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To
determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with
encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for
each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation
achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines,
including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla
Transformer. While not ready for deployment, these results demonstrate a
promising path towards automated referee assistance in foil fencing and new
opportunities for AI applications, such as coaching in the field of fencing.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMZ+提出了一种基于提示白名单的替代方法，通过只允许上下文适当的消息与代理式LLM交互来增强安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代理式AI相比传统模型具有更高的安全风险，因为它们拥有对数据源和API工具的特权访问，且依赖AI的非确定性行为。现有的检测恶意意图的防御机制不足以应对越狱攻击。

Method: 采用提示白名单方法，只允许符合预定义用例和操作边界的上下文适当消息与代理式LLM交互。

Result: 实证评估显示LLMZ+对常见越狱提示具有强韧性，同时不干扰合法业务通信。在实验设置中，假阳性和假阴性率均可降至0。

Conclusion: LLMZ+通过基于上下文的特异性保证所有外部用户与LLM之间的交换符合安全边界，简化了安全框架并增强了长期韧性。

Abstract: Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable
target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data
sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical
agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone
(DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI
(only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This
characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational
security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely
on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent,
thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this
paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond
traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting.
Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are
permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of
context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM
conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach
streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and
reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our
empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against
the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business
communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly
between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach
using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to
0 in our experimental setting.

Motivation: LLM在解决数学应用题时面临挑战，需要结合推理和数学能力。现有方法通过改进提示词帮助LLM解决复杂问题，但仍有提升空间。

Method: 首先让LLM将问题分解为方程，使用外部符号求解器生成答案；然后让LLM估算答案进行验证；如果验证失败，采用迭代修正过程确保找到正确答案。

Result: 在数值和代数数学应用题数据集上达到新的最优结果，平均提升近2%；在三角函数应用题上也获得满意结果，这是此前未尝试的任务。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM解决数学应用题的能力，并引入了两个新数据集SVAMPClean和Trig300来进一步测试LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various tasks, including
problem-solving and question-answering. However, LLMs often find Math Word
Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning
and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts
have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study
proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from
a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic
equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained
answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is
instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of
estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is
then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an
iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is
eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on
datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs,
improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In
addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a
task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also
introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the
testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型地理空间基于代理的模型，整合气候灾害数据与经济代理的进化学习，用于评估气候风险及其对经济系统的级联影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 气候风险评估需要建模空间异质性灾害与适应性经济系统之间的复杂相互作用，现有方法难以捕捉供应链中断等系统性风险。

Method: 结合Mesa空间建模与CLIMADA气候影响评估框架，引入基于适应度的选择和突变机制，使企业能够进化预算分配、定价、工资和风险适应策略。

Result: 使用RCP8.5情景下的河流洪水预测显示，进化适应使企业能够在数十年气候压力后恢复到基线生产水平；未直接暴露于洪水的代理也面临供应链中断影响，到世纪末商品平均价格比基线高5.6%。

Conclusion: 该开源框架为金融机构和公司提供了量化直接和级联气候风险的工具，同时评估成本效益适应的策略。

Abstract: Climate risk assessment requires modelling complex interactions between
spatially heterogeneous hazards and adaptive economic systems. We present a
novel geospatial agent-based model that integrates climate hazard data with
evolutionary learning for economic agents. Our framework combines Mesa-based
spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive
learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget
allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection
and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections
under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to
converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of
disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even
agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply
chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher
under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides
financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and
cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.

Abstract: Graph-based Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a widely studied
approach for improving the reasoning, accuracy, and factuality of Large
Language Models. However, many existing graph-based RAG systems overlook the
high cost associated with LLM token usage during graph construction, hindering
large-scale adoption. To address this, we propose TERAG, a simple yet effective
framework designed to build informative graphs at a significantly lower cost.
Inspired by HippoRAG, we incorporate Personalized PageRank (PPR) during the
retrieval phase, and we achieve at least 80% of the accuracy of widely used
graph-based RAG methods while consuming only 3%-11% of the output tokens.

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems.
However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to
guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be
demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an
EUROCAE/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level
objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains
training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the
difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description,
referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines
the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate
replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use
cases to build and compare several target models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出自主数据代理（DataAgents）的概念，通过集成LLM推理与任务分解、行动推理和工具调用，实现从复杂数据到知识的自动化转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和复杂性的增长，数据准备、转换和分析工作仍然劳动密集、重复且难以扩展。数据与AI之间的对齐至关重要，但数据通常不是以最适合AI利用的方式组织的。

Method: DataAgents通过动态规划工作流、调用强大工具和适应多样化数据任务，能够处理数据收集、集成、预处理、选择、转换、重新加权、增强、重编程、修复和检索等操作。

Result: DataAgents能够将复杂和非结构化数据转化为连贯且可操作的知识，代表了向自主数据到知识系统的范式转变。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁协同努力推进行动工作流优化、建立开放数据集和基准生态系统、保护隐私、平衡效率与可扩展性，并开发可信赖的DataAgent防护措施以防止恶意行为。

Abstract: As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming,
and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale.
Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment
between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways
that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises:
how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations?
Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task
decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can
autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks,
reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and
execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools,
DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to
diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a
paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are
capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection,
transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and
retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and
unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why
the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a
critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their
architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and
capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance
action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems,
safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy
DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.

TL;DR: 提出经验扩展框架，通过自主环境交互和协作经验共享实现LLM的持续进化，突破静态人类生成数据的限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通过扩大模型规模、训练数据和计算能力的方法已接近饱和，人类生成文本资源枯竭，需要新的持续学习机制

Method: 经验扩展框架：捕获原始交互→提炼为紧凑可重用知识→定期优化存储内容以保持相关性和效率

Result: 在模拟真实场景中验证，包括泛化到未见相关任务、重复查询和知识库过饱和情况，经验扩展提高了准确性、维持性能并保持对新情况的适应性

Conclusion: 结构化部署后学习能够扩展LLM能力，超越静态人类生成数据的限制，为持续智能进步提供可扩展路径

Abstract: Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in
large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as
human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose
experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for
LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative
sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions,
distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored
content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in
simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen
but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.
Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance
over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results
demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM
capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a
scalable path for continued intelligence progress.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构多代理系统中AI代理能力发现、元数据管理和来源验证的挑战，提供统一的目录服务以促进代理间的互操作性。

Method: 基于Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF)，采用两级映射架构（通过Kademlia-based DHT实现），重用OCI/ORAS基础设施进行工件分发，集成Sigstore进行来源验证，支持模式驱动的可扩展性。

Result: 构建了一个高效、可验证、多维的代理目录服务，支持新兴代理模式（如LLM提示代理、MCP服务器、A2A组件）的发现和管理。

Conclusion: ADS为异构多代理系统提供了统一的目录服务，解决了能力发现、元数据管理和来源验证的关键问题，促进了代理间的互操作性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The Agent Directory Service (ADS) is a distributed directory for the
discovery of AI agent capabilities, metadata, and provenance. It leverages
content-addressed storage, hierarchical taxonomies, and cryptographic signing
to enable efficient, verifiable, and multi-dimensional discovery across
heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Built on the Open Agentic Schema
Framework (OASF), ADS decouples capability indexing from content location
through a two-level mapping realized over a Kademlia-based Distributed Hash
Table (DHT). It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact
distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven
extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers,
A2A-enabled components). This paper formalizes the architectural model,
describes storage and discovery layers, explains security and performance
properties, and positions ADS within the broader landscape of emerging agent
registry and interoperability initiatives.

### [220] [Bounded PCTL Model Checking of Large Language Model Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18836)
*Dennis Gross,Helge Spieker,Arnaud Gotlieb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LLMCHECKER是一种基于模型检查的验证方法，用于验证LLM文本生成过程的概率计算树逻辑(PCTL)属性。该方法通过α-k有界文本生成来限制验证范围，聚焦于每个生成步骤中top-k令牌的α最大累积概率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本生成过程缺乏形式化验证方法，无法保证生成文本的一致性和可靠性。作者发现文本生成过程中通常只选择有限数量的令牌，但这些选择并不总是相同的，这为形式化验证提供了机会。

Method: 提出α-k有界文本生成方法：在每个文本生成步骤中，仅考虑top-k令牌中累积概率超过阈值α的令牌。LLMCHECKER利用此方法构建有限状态模型，然后应用PCTL模型检查技术进行形式化验证。

Result: 该方法在多个LLM模型（包括Llama、Gemma、Mistral、Genstruct和BERT）上进行了验证，展示了其适用性。这是首次将PCTL模型检查应用于LLM文本生成过程的一致性验证。

Conclusion: LLMCHECKER为LLM文本生成过程提供了首个基于PCTL的形式化验证框架，能够有效验证文本质量和偏见等量化属性，为LLM的可靠应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification
method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of
an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number
of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the
same. This insight drives the creation of $\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation,
narrowing the focus to the $\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the
top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification
method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while
accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text
quality and biases. The threshold $\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens,
only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability.
LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of
$\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in
several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our
knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to
check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.

Motivation: ICD编码对于临床文档、计费和医疗分析至关重要，但目前仍是劳动密集且容易出错的任务。虽然LLM在自动化ICD编码方面有潜力，但在基础模型选择、输入上下文化和训练数据冗余方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用LLM-as-judge评估协议与Plackett-Luce聚合来评估开源LLM对ICD-10-CM代码定义的内在理解；引入基于嵌入的相似性度量和冗余感知采样策略；利用台湾医院的结构化出院摘要评估上下文效果。

Result: 在两个机构数据集上的实验表明，经过微调的选择基础模型在内部和外部评估中始终优于基线LLM。纳入更多临床部分持续提高预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究使用开源LLM建立了一个实用且原则性的ICD-10-CM编码预测方法，提出的框架通过结合知情模型选择、高效数据细化和上下文感知提示，为自动化医疗编码系统的实际部署提供了可扩展的机构就绪解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding is critical
for clinical documentation, billing, and healthcare analytics, yet it remains a
labour-intensive and error-prone task. Although large language models (LLMs)
show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model
selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their
effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification
(ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled
model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design.
The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce
aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic
comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based
similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove
semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge
summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine
section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling
paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the
selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in
internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections
consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs
to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction.
The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for
real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed
model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法在优势函数分配上存在优势反转和优势镜像问题，阻碍了不同查询样本间合理的优势分配，需要一种更有效的策略来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MAPO策略，识别轨迹具有不同确定性，为高确定性轨迹样本引入优势百分比偏差，并动态重新加权优势函数以适应不同轨迹确定性的样本。

Result: 与相关最先进方法的比较以及对不同优势变体的消融研究验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPO是一种简单但有效的GRPO策略，能够通过动态优势函数配置来提升基础模型在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the
performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage
function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory
importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion
and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation
across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective
GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the
trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent
deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we
dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory
certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for
sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art
methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates
the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 当前用户画像任务缺乏全面基准，且面临标签稀缺、数据异构和噪声问题，限制了LLM在用户画像中的应用效果

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）利用高级LLM生成高质量标签，通过置信度加权投票和校准；2）使用置信度引导的无监督强化学习增强推理能力，包括难度过滤、准真实标签投票和奖励加权

Result: 实验结果显示Conf-Profile框架显著提升性能，在Qwen3-8B模型上将F1分数提高了13.97分

Conclusion: 该方法为标签稀缺场景下的用户画像提供了有效解决方案，通过置信度机制提高了LLM在真实工业环境中的可靠性和性能

Abstract: User profiling, as a core technique for user understanding, aims to infer
structural attributes from user information. Large Language Models (LLMs)
provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by
the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose
ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform,
encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy.
However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of
collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy
user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free
and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning
framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize
high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed
by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence
calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results,
rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a
lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided
unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty
filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental
results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through
the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.

Method: 提出记忆四元组（位置、持久性、写入/访问路径、可控性），采用三设置协议（仅参数、离线检索、在线检索），构建分层评估体系，集成时间治理和泄漏审计，提出DMM Gov更新和遗忘协调机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM记忆研究提供了可重现、可比较和可治理的基础，通过四个可测试命题进一步推动了该领域的发展，有助于实现更安全、可靠的LLM部署。

Abstract: Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent
state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be
addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy
(parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple
(location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism,
evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To
avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a
three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval)
that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and
timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book
recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves
and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet
attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency
and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and
leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and
uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with
multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM
Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC),
and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout,
monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict
handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable
propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally
constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with
small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a
reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and
deployment.

Result: 在复杂推理任务上达到开源模型的最先进性能，在AIME-25上智能体推理的平均token消耗减少64.5%，从19,653降至6,965，且任务准确性不降低。

Conclusion: LongCat-Flash-Thinking模型在推理效率和性能方面表现出色，为推理系统和智能体AI研究提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter
open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities
are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with
long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale
Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start
training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and
equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning.
Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples
optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and
subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly
Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic
ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL
framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over
synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result,
LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source
models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional
efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5%
(from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We
release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems
and agentic AI research.

Abstract: Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a
critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous
systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving
human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we
present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of
existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training
strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial
intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial
understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence
benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings.
Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between
perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks
but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly
in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial
imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain
in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap
and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法存在灾难性遗忘和数据效率低下的问题，限制了在实际应用中的适用性。

Method: DEAL框架整合了LoRA技术和连续微调策略，包含知识保留和自适应参数更新模块，在保护隐私的设置下保持效率。

Result: 在15个不同数据集上的实验表明，DEAL持续优于基线方法，在任务准确性和资源效率方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过增强任务性能同时提高资源效率，展现了在LLMs中推进持续适应的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the
critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific
tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible.
Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing
models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications.
However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting
and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that
integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy.
By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the
framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining
efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets
show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding
substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings
demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in
LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.

Abstract: Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based
agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like
cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being
deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education,
scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable
potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which
can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the
overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep
understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based
agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of
hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete
workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types
of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct
an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence
of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of
existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and
detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this
survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in
LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and
reliable agent systems.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型能否从数学可解释的推荐模型中生成有效的用户导向解释，通过用户研究评估不同解释策略的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释AI研究多依赖自动评估指标，无法真实反映用户需求和感知，需要采用用户中心的方法来评估解释质量。

Method: 基于约束矩阵分解构建可解释推荐模型，通过精心设计的LLM提示将模型结构转化为自然语言解释，对326名参与者进行用户研究，评估五种关键维度的解释质量。

Result: 所有解释类型都受到良好接受，不同策略间存在适度统计差异，用户评论提供了超出定量结果的补充见解。

Conclusion: LLM能够从数学可解释模型生成有效的用户导向解释，用户中心评估方法为可解释AI提供了更全面的评估视角。

Abstract: We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can generate effective,
user-facing explanations from a mathematically interpretable recommendation
model. The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types
are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as
observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted
scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural
language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in
explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to
capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a
user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed
the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency,
effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the
recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are
perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying
model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals
that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate
statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore
how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary
insights beyond the quantitative results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了四种剩余时间预测方法在物流公司出库仓库流程中的表现，发现深度学习模型准确率最高，但浅层方法如传统提升技术在计算资源需求上更少且准确率具有竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测性流程监控是流程挖掘的一个子领域，旨在预测正在进行的流程执行的未来。剩余时间预测是一个常见的预测目标，即流程执行完成所需的时间。本文旨在比较不同方法在真实物流场景中的表现。

Method: 在航空业务物流公司的真实出库仓库流程中，比较了四种剩余时间预测方法。使用了包含169,523条轨迹的原始事件日志进行实验。

Result: 深度学习模型达到了最高的准确率，但浅层方法如传统提升技术也达到了具有竞争力的准确率，并且需要显著更少的计算资源。

Conclusion: 虽然深度学习在准确率上表现最佳，但浅层方法在准确率和计算效率之间提供了更好的平衡，对于资源受限的实际应用场景具有重要价值。

Abstract: Predictive process monitoring is a sub-domain of process mining which aims to
forecast the future of ongoing process executions. One common prediction target
is the remaining time, meaning the time that will elapse until a process
execution is completed. In this paper, we compare four different remaining time
prediction approaches in a real-life outbound warehouse process of a logistics
company in the aviation business. For this process, the company provided us
with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make
publicly available. Unsurprisingly, we find that deep learning models achieve
the highest accuracy, but shallow methods like conventional boosting techniques
achieve competitive accuracy and require significantly fewer computational
resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法评估程序生成内容时难以找到与人类体验一致的指标，特别是对于复合产物

Method: 引入嵌套概念：Landmarks（可感知性）、Monuments（唤起性）和Beacons（行动召唤），基于玩家中心视角

Result: 这些概念具有游戏通用性，可用现有技术进行识别和评估，为完全自动化PCG分解开辟道路

Conclusion: 该方法连接了人文学科和技术游戏研究，支持更好的计算PCG评估，适用于混合主动PCG和组合PCG等场景

Abstract: Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find
metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts.
Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a
range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI
research, we introduce the nested concepts of \textit{Landmarks},
\textit{Monuments}, and \textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the
artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a
player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across
genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques
currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully
automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components.
Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and
compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this
approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical
game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation

Method: 引入可观测源作为辅助变量的框架，使用保体积编码器实现潜在变量的子空间变换和排列识别，并提供变量选择方案来选择最大化潜在因子可恢复性的辅助变量。

Result: 实验证明该框架在合成图和图像数据上有效，能够识别整个潜在变量，扩展了现有方法的边界。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过利用可观测源作为辅助变量，成功扩展了因果表示学习的识别能力，为处理更广泛的现实场景提供了新途径。

Abstract: Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate
observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent
structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works
often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables.
However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external
to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can
be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating
identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources
being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main
results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise
transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover,
when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a
variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the
latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic
graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.

TL;DR: CoPiC提出了一种代码驱动的规划方法，通过生成多样化高级规划程序并使用领域自适应批评器来评估候选计划，显著减少LLM查询成本并提高长期奖励对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM规划方法依赖频繁查询进行迭代优化，成本高昂且受限于短期环境反馈，难以实现长期奖励对齐。

Method: 使用LLM生成多样化高级规划程序，通过领域自适应批评器评估候选计划，选择最符合长期奖励的方案执行。

Result: 在ALFWorld、NetHack和StarCraft II Unit Building中，CoPiC相比AdaPlanner和Reflexion平均成功率提升23.33%，查询成本降低91.27%。

Conclusion: CoPiC通过代码驱动规划和领域自适应批评器机制，有效解决了LLM规划中的查询成本高和长期奖励对齐问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI
agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world
knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and
environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address
this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine
plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query
costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental
feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards.
We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of
relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of
high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate
plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and
selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using
high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as
estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs.
Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC
outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving
an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in
query costs.

TL;DR: AgentInit是一种多智能体系统初始化方法，通过优化智能体团队结构来提升系统性能，结合自然语言到格式机制和帕累托平衡选择策略，在多个框架和任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多智能体系统初始化方法未能充分考虑后续阶段生成智能体的协作需求，需要一种能够优化智能体团队结构的方法来提升系统效率和效果。

Method: 提出AgentInit方法，包含多轮智能体交互反思、自然语言到格式机制确保一致性，以及基于帕累托原则的平衡团队选择策略，同时考虑团队多样性和任务相关性。

Result: 实验表明AgentInit在多个框架和任务中持续优于最先进的初始化方法和预定义策略，性能提升分别达到1.2和1.6倍，同时显著减少token消耗。

Conclusion: AgentInit具有良好的可迁移性，关键组件有效性得到验证，证明其作为可靠多智能体系统初始化方法的能力和适应性。

Abstract: Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent
systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's
efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do
not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in
subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we
propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams.
Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between
agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to
Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team
selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to
jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective
and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments
show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization
methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks,
achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6,
respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further
analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the
effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and
adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method. Source code and models

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在西方中心偏见，限制了其在多元文化背景下的有效性。虽然已有研究探索文化对齐，但跨文化迁移潜力（利用一种文化的对齐来提升其他文化性能）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用覆盖13个阿拉伯国家的文化基础常识推理数据集，评估轻量级对齐方法（上下文学习、演示强化DITTO）以及监督微调和直接偏好优化等基线方法。

Result: 结果显示，仅需12个特定文化示例就能在阿拉伯世界其他国家平均提升10%性能；来自印尼和美国的跨文化演示在多项选择题推理中也能达到或超越文化内对齐效果。

Conclusion: 这些发现表明高效的跨文化对齐是可行的，为将LLMs适应低资源文化环境提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting
their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.
