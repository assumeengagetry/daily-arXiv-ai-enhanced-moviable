### [1] [ESCA: Contextualizing Embodied Agents via Scene-Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15963)
*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来增强多模态大语言模型，在无需人工标注的情况下实现像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高层视觉-声音-文本对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度结构化对齐，这限制了其在具身智能体中的应用。

Method: 开发了SGClip模型，这是一种基于CLIP的开放域可提示场景图生成模型，通过神经符号学习管道在87K+开放域视频上训练，利用视频-字幕对和结构化推理实现模型驱动的自监督。

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现出色，ESCA框架持续改进开源和商业MLLMs，在两个具身环境中实现最先进性能，显著减少感知错误并使开源模型超越专有基线。

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解成功增强了多模态大语言模型，证明了无需人工标注的场景图生成在提升具身智能体性能方面的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CrossRay3D稀疏多模态检测器，通过Ray-Aware Supervision和Class-Balanced Supervision提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度快1.84倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视了token表示质量，导致前景质量次优和性能受限。研究发现几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)，核心模块包括：Ray-Aware Supervision(RAS)在训练阶段保持丰富几何信息；Class-Balanced Supervision自适应重加权类别语义显著性；Ray Positional Encoding解决LiDAR和图像模态间的分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度比其他领先方法快1.84倍。在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失的场景下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在保持稀疏检测器优势的同时显著提升了性能，证明了几何结构保持和类别平衡监督对稀疏多模态检测的重要性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个基于CCTV监控的智能城市基础设施缺陷检测系统，使用YOLO进行多缺陷检测和分割，并通过视觉语言模型生成结构化维修计划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增长，手动检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只能处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果

Method: 使用YOLO系列目标检测器进行多缺陷检测和分割，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成JSON格式的结构化行动计划

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IAD-GPT，一种基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息实现先进的异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大预训练模型的方法尚未充分激发其在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，设计多掩码融合模块将掩码作为专家知识增强像素级异常感知。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的广泛实验证明了在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中的最先进性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功将多模态大语言模型应用于工业异常检测，实现了先进的检测和分割性能，并为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种放射学报告模式（自由文本、结构化报告、AI辅助结构化报告）对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响。AI辅助结构化报告在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估结构化报告和人工智能如何改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，探索不同报告模式对诊断流程的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究，使用眼动追踪系统，让8名读者（4名新手和4名非新手）分别使用三种报告模式分析35张床旁胸片，比较诊断准确性、报告时间、眼动指标和用户体验问卷。

Result: AI辅助结构化报告的诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域，且成为最受偏好的报告模式。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个数据驱动的框架来分析并缓解图像分类中的交叉偏见，通过IFEF评估框架识别偏见模式，并使用BWA数据增强策略改善少数群体子组的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在非平衡数据集上训练时经常表现出交叉偏见，即由多个属性（如物体类别和环境条件）相互作用产生的系统性错误。

Method: 引入交叉公平性评估框架（IFEF）结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具，提出基于偏见加权的数据增强策略（BWA），根据子组分布统计自适应调整变换强度。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上的实验显示，BWA将代表性不足的类别-环境交叉点的准确性提高了最多24个百分点，同时将公平性指标差异减少了35%。统计分析确认了改进的显著性（p < 0.05）。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析和解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见提供了一个可复现的途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的神经网络量化方法，支持多比特量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅损失不到1%的准确率，训练仅需15个epoch。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分方法，学习能力受限；二是之前的移位/对数量化要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。

Method: 开发了可微分的量化方法，支持n比特量化，特别是对数形式的2^n量化，无需高精度乘法运算。

Result: 仅权重量化时准确率损失小于1%，权重和激活同时量化时达到SOTA水平，训练仅需15个epoch，推理成本略高于1比特量化但无需高精度乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可证明收敛到最优神经网络的可微分量化方案，在多比特量化方面具有优势，在准确率和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

### [8] [GuideFlow3D: Optimization-Guided Rectified Flow For Appearance Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16136)
*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过引导预训练的整流流模型来将外观（图像或文本）转移到3D资产上，解决了现有方法在几何差异较大时失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在输入和外观对象的几何形状显著不同时会失败，直接应用3D生成模型也无法产生吸引人的结果，需要一种更有效的外观转移方法。

Method: 基于通用引导的采样过程交互方法，使用预训练的整流流模型，定期添加可微损失函数作为引导，包括部分感知损失和自相似性损失。

Result: 成功将纹理和几何细节转移到3D资产，在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，并通过GPT评估系统和用户研究验证了效果。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和引导函数，解决了传统评估指标在缺乏真实数据时无法关注局部细节的问题。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

*Jianhan Lin,Yuchu Qin,Shuai Gao,Yikang Rui,Jie Liu,Yanjie Lv*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了StripRFNet，一种用于道路表面损伤检测的新型深度神经网络，通过三个模块解决了损伤形状多样、细长裂缝检测困难和微小损伤识别误差高的问题，在RDD2022基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维护良好的道路网络对实现可持续发展目标11至关重要。道路表面损伤不仅威胁交通安全，还阻碍可持续城市发展。但由于损伤形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉以及小规模损伤识别错误率高，准确检测仍然具有挑战性。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：(1)形状感知模块通过多尺度特征聚合中的大分离核注意力增强形状辨别；(2)条带感受野模块使用大条带卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；(3)小规模增强模块利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改进小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，StripRFNet超越了现有方法。在中国子集上，F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高了4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点。在完整数据集上，与CRDDC'2022参与者和ORDDC'2024第2阶段结果相比，实现了最高的F1分数80.33%，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的准确性和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了一个有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

*Xiangyu Mu,Dongliang Zhou,Jie Hou,Haijun Zhang,Weili Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将服装模特假人视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人类视频，解决头部与身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 服装假人展示成本低但缺乏真实感和细节表现力，需要将假人视频转换为逼真的人类视频以提升在线时尚展示效果。

Method: 采用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义与身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器，使用DDIM一步去噪增强时间一致性。

Result: 在UBC时尚数据集、自建ASOS数据集和现场采集的MannequinVideos数据集上验证，在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo框架有效解决了假人到人类视频生成中的关键挑战，实现了高质量的身份可控视频生成。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理时分别应用颜色空间扰动和扩散模型生成，提升自动驾驶感知的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶的安全关键决策需要可靠的感知，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个对象进行颜色空间扰动，并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的对象应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的YOLOv8实验表明，该方法在所有对象类别上都带来了显著的准确性提升和不确定性减少，在推理时对假阳性预测了比真阳性更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理时分别具有减少和量化视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

TL;DR: 提出DuetMatch，一种用于医学图像分割的双分支半监督框架，通过异步优化编码器和解码器，结合解耦dropout扰动和配对CutMix交叉引导，在脑MRI分割数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像标注数据有限，半监督学习具有吸引力。但联合优化整个网络会阻碍收敛和稳定性，特别是在挑战性场景中。

Method: 双分支异步优化框架，每个分支分别优化编码器或解码器；引入解耦dropout扰动增强正则化；设计配对CutMix交叉引导通过增强输入对交换伪标签；提出一致性匹配使用冻结教师模型的稳定预测来细化标签。

Result: 在ISLES2022和BraTS等脑MRI分割基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，DuetMatch始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DuetMatch在多样化的半监督分割场景中展现出有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C臂，这会增加辐射暴露和手术延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化，采用保形预测校准不确定性，生成3D置信区域。

Result: 在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上验证，显示出强大的定位准确性和良好校准的预测边界。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力成为安全可靠自主C臂系统的组成部分，能减少辐射暴露并提高手术效率。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

Motivation: 当前深度生成模型生成的图像质量尚未达到传统摄影方法的标准，生产流程中需要手动图像质量评估，这一过程耗时且昂贵，特别是由于自动生成图像通过质量标准的比例较低。

Method: 引入自动预过滤阶段，通过公式估计基于IQA引擎精度和通过率的成本节省，并在背景修复用例中应用简单的AutoML解决方案。

Result: 在背景修复用例中，使用简单的AutoML解决方案实现了51.61%的显著成本节省。

Conclusion: 自动预过滤阶段可以有效提高发送给审核的图像的整体质量，从而降低获得高质量图像的平均成本。

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Motivation: 理解大脑如何编码视觉信息是神经科学和机器学习的重要挑战。目前尚不清楚哪种潜在空间最适合将fMRI信号转换为视觉刺激重建，以及如何组织该空间以有效表示视觉刺激。

Method: 提出PRISM模型：1）将fMRI信号投影到结构化文本空间；2）使用面向对象的扩散模块通过组合单个对象生成图像以减少对象检测错误；3）属性关系搜索模块自动识别与神经活动最匹配的关键属性和关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建非常重要，fMRI信号与语言模型的文本空间比基于视觉的空间或联合文本图像空间更相似。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

*Nyle Siddiqui,Rohit Gupta,Sirnam Swetha,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态调整时空分辨率来增强状态空间模型在视频理解中的适应能力，解决了传统方法在未见时空分辨率下的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对Transformer设计，未能充分利用状态空间模型的独特优势。传统方法在固定分辨率和视频长度下训练，导致模型在面对训练时未见过的时空分辨率时性能下降，限制了模型在长短视频上的通用性。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法：在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度。比较了五种不同的灵活训练变体，确定了最适合视频状态空间模型的策略。

Result: 在短动作（UCF-101、HMDB-51）和长动作（COIN、Breakfast）基准测试中，StretchySnake比Transformer和状态空间模型基线性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作（SSV2、Diving-48）上表现出强大的适应能力。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频状态空间模型在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有CNN模型难以捕捉全局面部特征，Vision Transformer能建模长距离空间关系但计算复杂度高，需要结合两种模型的优势。

Method: 使用ViT捕捉全局面部结构和对称性，Mamba模型以线性复杂度建模长距离依赖关系，专注于序列特征和纹理，通过异构集成融合两种骨干网络。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了强大的新架构范式，通过融合ViT和Mamba模型的优势，有效解决了面部美颜预测中的全局特征建模问题。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OCSCC是头颈部最常见的癌症，早期症状不明显且生长缓慢，常被忽视导致可预防的死亡。利用CNN的精确图像分割和模式识别能力可以早期检测OCSCC。

Method: 训练CNN模型使用4293张训练图像（良性/恶性肿瘤及阴性样本），评估精度、召回率和mAP。测试不同分辨率图像，开发图像增强硬件和应用软件。

Result: 图像分辨率增加时预测准确率按对数尺度提高，显示更高像素数带来的收益递减。设计的硬件系统成功捕获详细图像。

Conclusion: CNN结合图像采集硬件能有效检测OCSCC，图像分辨率对检测准确性有重要影响但存在收益递减效应。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Conclusion: 该方法为传统物体级重建方法提供了一个灵活、渐进式的替代方案，能够有效利用第一人称视角直播中的人-物交互线索。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Method: 采用两级级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线推理时结合轻量级过滤和细粒度VLM推理。关键创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Conclusion: Cerberus是实时视频分析的实际可行解决方案，在保持高精度的同时实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time
video analytics.

Method: 引入包含6000张图像的受控基准测试，其中成员和非成员样本的分布经过精心平衡，并在三个不同的训练阶段提供真实成员标签。

Result: 在无偏条件下，最先进的成员推理攻击方法的性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明先前的高成功率主要源于数据集偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA阐明了当前LVLM成员推理攻击研究的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Motivation: 缺乏足够规模的数据集来研究深度伪造检测任务的缩放规律，需要构建大规模数据集来分析模型性能与真实图像域数量、深度伪造方法数量和训练图像数量之间的关系。

Method: 构建了ScaleDF数据集，包含580万张来自51个不同域的真实图像和880万张由102种深度伪造方法生成的假图像，通过该数据集分析缩放规律。

Result: 观察到平均检测错误率随真实域数量或深度伪造方法数量的增加呈可预测的幂律衰减，可以据此预测达到目标性能所需的额外资源。

Conclusion: 缩放规律为对抗不断演进的深度伪造技术提供了数据中心的解决方案，同时研究了预训练和数据增强在缩放中的作用以及缩放本身的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

### [28] [Scale-DiT: Ultra-High-Resolution Image Generation with Hierarchical Local Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16325)
*Yuyao Zhang,Yu-Wing Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Scale-DiT是一个新的扩散框架，通过分层局部注意力和低分辨率全局引导，实现高效、可扩展的超高分辨率图像生成，支持4K分辨率而无需额外高分辨率训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型受限于注意力机制的二次复杂性和4K训练数据的稀缺，无法实现超高分辨率文本到图像生成。需要解决细粒度纹理合成和全局结构一致性的挑战。

Method: 采用分层局部注意力机制，将高分辨率潜在空间划分为固定大小的局部窗口以降低注意力复杂度；使用低分辨率潜在空间提供全局语义引导；通过LoRA适配器连接全局和局部路径；采用Hilbert曲线重排和融合内核优化推理效率。

Result: Scale-DiT相比密集注意力基线推理速度提升2倍以上，内存使用更低，可靠扩展到4K×4K分辨率。在FID、IS、CLIP Score等定量指标和定性比较中，均表现出更好的全局一致性和更清晰的局部细节。

Conclusion: 分层局部注意力与引导低分辨率锚点是推进超高分辨率图像生成的有效方法，无需额外高分辨率训练数据即可实现高质量4K图像生成。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: 提出了DiffusionX框架，通过云边协同实现高效的多轮提示图像生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著降低生成时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型生成过程计算密集，用户需要多次迭代优化提示词，增加了延迟并给云资源带来沉重负担。

Method: 采用云边协同框架，轻量级设备端扩散模型快速生成预览图像，高容量云端模型在提示词确定后进行最终优化，并引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载。

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5平均生成时间减少15.8%，图像质量相当；仅比Tiny-SD慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下展示了效率和可扩展性，有效解决了扩散模型生成延迟和云资源负担问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了TokenAR框架，通过token级增强机制解决多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，包含token索引嵌入、指令token注入和身份token解缠策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在条件图像生成中表现出色，但在多参考生成时难以解耦不同参考身份，存在身份混淆问题。

Method: TokenAR框架包含三个部分：1) Token索引嵌入聚类相同参考图像的token；2) 指令token注入作为额外视觉特征容器；3) 身份token解缠策略明确引导每个token独立表示不同身份特征。

Result: 该方法显著增强了现有AR方法在条件图像生成中的能力，在保持高质量背景重建的同时实现良好的身份一致性。

Conclusion: 综合实验验证该方法在多参考图像生成任务中超越了当前最先进模型，并发布了首个开源的大规模多参考输入数据集InstructAR。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

### [31] [RL makes MLLMs see better than SFT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16333)
*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型(MLLM)性能主要继承自LLM骨干网络的假设，发现视觉编码器在RL训练后会产生更强、更精确的视觉表示，并提出了PIVOT方法来高效优化视觉编码器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM研究过度关注LLM骨干网络而忽视视觉编码器的作用，特别是在从SFT转向RL的训练范式转变中，缺乏对视觉编码器如何被重塑的分析。

Method: 通过ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化等多样化实验，分析不同训练策略对MLLM视觉编码器的影响，并提出了PIVOT方法来优化视觉编码器。

Result: RL训练相比SFT能产生更强且更精确的视觉表示，PIVOT训练的视觉编码器性能优于更大规模训练的对手，且计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器在MLLM中扮演关键角色，RL训练能显著提升其能力，PIVOT方法为MLLM视觉骨干网络的进步提供了高效路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言辅助图像聚类中如何从未标注的语料库中筛选出与目标图像语义相近的正名词的挑战，现有基于CLIP特征空间的方法缺乏理论支撑。

Method: 提出基于梯度的GradNorm框架，通过计算预测目标分布与softmax输出之间的交叉熵反向传播的梯度大小来衡量名词的积极性。

Result: 理论分析提供了正名词可分性的严格误差界，证明GradNorm包含现有筛选策略作为特例；实验表明在多个基准测试中达到最先进的聚类性能。

Conclusion: GradNorm为语言辅助图像聚类中的名词筛选提供了理论保证的解决方案，在理论和实证上都表现出色。

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交制造模式在实现大规模个性化的同时，带来了质量控制的挑战，特别是在缺陷检测方面，主要困难包括产品高度定制化、生产碎片化小批量订单以及分布式站点成像环境差异大。

Method: 构建MIRAD数据集，捕获社交制造领域的三个关键维度：多样化个性化产品、地理分散制造节点数据收集、显著的成像异质性。并对最先进的异常检测方法进行全面评估。

Result: 所有模型在MIRAD上的性能相比传统基准都显著下降，突显了现实世界个性化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。

Conclusion: MIRAD通过连接工业需求和学术研究，为开发工业5.0所需的鲁棒质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,

layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a
domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model
on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于AR/VR边缘设备的实时手部姿态估计任务。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on
FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个通用有效的范式，使用可验证的自监督目标来对齐多模态模型

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

TL;DR: LightGlueStick是一个轻量级的点线联合匹配器，通过注意力线消息传递机制实现高效的点线特征匹配，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点线匹配被视为独立任务，GlueStick虽然实现了联合匹配但架构过重，无法满足实时应用或边缘设备部署需求。

Method: 提出注意力线消息传递机制，显式地将线段连通性暴露给网络，实现节点间高效通信。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，同时大幅降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick成功实现了轻量化的点线联合匹配，为实时应用和边缘设备部署提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for
efficient communication between nodes. In thorough experiments we show that
LightGlueStick establishes a new state-of-the-art across different benchmarks.

*Haoran Sun,Chen Cai,Huiping Zhuang,Kong Aik Lee,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出可解释深度伪造视频检测任务EDVD，设计EDVD-LLaMA多模态大语言模型推理框架，通过时空细微信息标记化和细粒度多模态思维链机制，提供可追溯的推理过程和可信解释。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RefAtomNet++框架，用于解决Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR)任务，通过多层级语义对齐的交叉注意力机制和多轨迹Mamba建模，在RefAVA++数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RefAtomNet模型在跨模态信息对齐和检索方面存在局限，导致在定位目标人物和预测细粒度动作时表现不佳。需要开发更有效的框架来处理语言引导的原子级动作识别任务。

Method: 提出了RefAtomNet++框架，包含多层级语义对齐的交叉注意力机制和多轨迹Mamba建模，在部分关键词、场景属性和整体句子三个层次上构建扫描轨迹，动态选择最近的视觉空间标记。

Result: 实验表明RefAtomNet++在RefAVA++数据集上建立了新的最先进结果，超越了包括RefAtomNet在内的多个基线模型。

Conclusion: RefAtomNet++通过改进的跨模态标记聚合机制，显著提升了语言引导的原子级视频动作识别性能，为复杂多人场景中的交互式人类动作分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

Motivation: 传统目标检测框架在处理旋转目标时性能不佳，特别是在航空影像、遥感和自动驾驶等应用中，需要有效捕捉方向变化。

Method: 使用高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离，引入各向异性高斯表示来处理方形物体，并集成旋转不变损失函数到最先进的深度学习旋转目标检测器中。

Result: 大量实验表明，在平均精度指标上相比现有方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力为旋转目标检测建立新的基准，对需要精确可靠目标定位的应用具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，并在预训练子空间之外注入新的表示方向，来增强自监督模型的适应能力。


<details>

Motivation: 在基础模型时代，完全微调预训练网络对每个下游任务来说资源消耗巨大。现有的视觉提示调优方法在应用于自监督骨干网络时，往往无法专门化提示或丰富表示空间，特别是在具有挑战性的任务和数据稀缺环境中。

Method: VIPAMIN通过(1)将提示与嵌入空间中的语义信息区域对齐，(2)在预训练子空间之外注入新的表示方向来增强自监督模型的适应。该方法只需要单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在各种任务和数据集大小上持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优领域达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN提供了一种简单而有效的视觉提示初始化策略，能够显著提升自监督模型在资源受限环境下的适应能力。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

Motivation: 电子显微镜图像中线粒体实例分割的标注成本高昂，无监督域自适应方法在实际应用中性能较低，需要探索更有效的弱监督域自适应方法。

Method: 多任务学习框架联合进行分割和中心检测，采用交叉教学机制、类聚焦跨域对比学习，以及基于检测任务的实例感知伪标签选择策略。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上的验证表明，该方法优于现有的无监督和弱监督域自适应方法，显著缩小了与全监督方法的性能差距。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用稀疏点标注和多任务学习，在线粒体分割任务中实现了优异的性能，为生物医学图像分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要基于历史信息进行决策，忽视了行动的未来影响和长期结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的导航智能体。

Method: 使用大规模无标签轨迹数据训练Q模型学习室内场景布局和物体关系知识，生成描述潜在未来信息的Q特征，通过跨模态未来编码器将任务无关的Q特征与导航指令结合，产生反映未来前景的行动得分，结合历史得分采用A*风格搜索策略。

Result: 在广泛使用的面向目标VLN数据集上进行的大量实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合未来预测和历史信息，实现了更有效的目标导向导航，为视觉语言导航提供了新的前瞻性决策框架。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯泼溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致解码端的比特率效率和重建质量不理想，阻碍了其在可流式3D虚拟人系统中的应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（通过StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），支持分层压缩、渐进解码和可控渲染。

Result: 实验结果表明HGC-Avatar在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法，为快速3D虚拟人渲染提供了可流式解决方案。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过分层设计和面部注意力机制，在低比特率约束下有效保持了身份和表情细节，实现了高效的动态虚拟人传输和渲染。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在科学研究中的应用日益增多，但它们在理解论文中文本、图表、方程等多模态复杂性以及检测和解决不一致性方面的可靠性尚不明确。现有基准要么孤立单一模态，要么依赖合成错误，无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（包括审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤和人工验证）构建PRISMM-Bench基准，包含262个不一致案例。设计了三个任务：不一致性识别、纠正和配对匹配。引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少语言偏见。

Result: 对21个领先的LMM模型进行基准测试，结果显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型（GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B）和专有模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5）。

Conclusion: 多模态科学推理具有挑战性，当前LMM模型在检测和解决科学论文中多模态不一致性方面表现不佳，需要进一步改进以开发可信赖的科学助手。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Result: 提出的方法在平均精度(mAP)上比现有最优方法提高了1.8%。消融研究表明辅助学习使mAP提高3.7%，深度归一化使mAP提高4.2%。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习和深度归一化有效提升了缺货检测性能，证明了辅助任务对主任务的正向影响。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Motivation: 开发一种代表性中心的图像分类和检索方法，利用图结构捕捉图像间的相似关系，并通过注意力机制突出重要特征。

Conclusion: 提出的基于图注意力网络自编码器的代表性中心方法在图像分类和检索任务中表现有效，能够捕捉图像间的关键特征和关系。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重构和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准对比目标训练的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，主要因为文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重构目标：使用冻结预训练解码器基于原始标题嵌入重构替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标：在嵌入空间中显式对齐释义句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强传统微调基线高出4.1%。应用于现有CLIP变体也能提升性能。

Conclusion: 重构和对齐目标提供互补优势：重构鼓励编码器捕捉标题内单词间关系，对齐确保不同措辞的释义具有一致表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

Conclusion: GaitRDAE通过动态区域感知方法有效解决了步态识别中运动区域动态变化和协变量影响的问题。

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions

*Guangyu Lin,Li Lin,Christina P. Walker,Daniel S. Schiff,Shu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于真实世界政治深度伪造事件的系统基准测试，发现现有检测器对真实政治深度伪造的泛化能力不足，呼吁开发政治情境化的检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散增加了虚假信息风险，特别是政治深度伪造。现有检测模型大多基于实验室合成数据训练，难以泛化到真实社交媒体上的政治深度伪造。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库构建系统基准，对学术界、政府和工业界的最先进深度伪造检测器进行系统评估。

Result: 学术界和政府检测器表现相对较差，付费检测工具性能较高但所有检测器都对真实政治深度伪造泛化能力不足，且易受简单操作影响，尤其在视频领域。

Conclusion: 需要开发政治情境化的深度伪造检测框架，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个无需训练的框架，通过重新加权视觉标记、引入噪声派生标记和应用对抗攻击来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在物体幻觉问题，即模型产生看似合理但不准确的物体描述。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将LVLM幻觉追溯到视觉编码器，并识别出三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，包含三种策略：重新加权视觉标记以减少统计偏差、引入噪声派生标记来对抗固有偏差、应用带有对比解码的对抗攻击来解决脆弱性。

Result: 实验表明SHIELD能有效缓解多种基准测试和LVLM家族中的物体幻觉问题，并在通用LVLM基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SHIELD框架无需训练即可有效缓解LVLM中的物体幻觉，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级即插即用的视觉令牌压缩框架，通过可学习的决策过程实现高效自适应令牌选择，在各种压缩率下保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有令牌压缩技术受限于启发式规则，可能丢弃关键信息并存在注意力偏差。

Method: 提出VisionSelector评分器模块，采用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，与MLLM主干解耦，实现端到端可学习的令牌压缩决策。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在MME基准上以30%保留预算保持100%准确率，在10%保留预算下比先前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度翻倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector提供了一种高效、自适应的令牌压缩解决方案，在各种压缩预算下均表现优异，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to
enhance diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency across multiple
imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Motivation: 解决小型无人机在室内环境中的自主导航问题，克服GPS不可用和LiDAR传感器成本高昂的限制，实现轻量级、低成本的视觉导航方案。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏框架，使用SVM教师网络生成训练数据，训练轻量级U-Net学生网络进行实时语义分割；提出自适应尺度因子算法将非度量深度预测转换为精确度量距离测量。

Result: 在5x4米实验室环境中测试，平均距离误差14.4厘米；30次真实环境飞行测试和100次数字孪生环境测试显示，组合方法增加了监视距离，减少了任务时间，成功率100%；端到端学习实现87.5%的自主任务成功率。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了结构化环境中基于视觉的无人机导航实践，解决了度量深度估计和计算效率挑战，可在资源受限平台上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

TL;DR: MultiVerse是一个新颖的多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个流行的VLM评估基准，用于评估视觉语言模型在复杂多轮对话中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多轮数据集仅部分捕捉用户遇到的对话场景的广度和深度，需要更全面的基准来评估VLM在真实世界多轮对话中的表现。

Method: 从12个流行的VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮，涵盖484个任务和交互目标。使用基于检查表的评估方法，利用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，测量37个关键方面的性能。

Result: 评估了18个VLM，即使最强的模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%的成功率。提供完整对话上下文显著提升了较小或较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLM多轮交互能力的全面基准，揭示了当前模型在复杂对话场景中的局限性，并强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出使用检索增强生成方法，通过图数据库和Cypher查询语言接口，让大语言模型能够有效处理大规模3D场景图，解决自然语言与机器人世界表示之间的连接问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图。需要一种更有效的方法来连接自然语言与机器人的世界表示。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具接口，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估表明，使用Cypher作为3D场景图接口的方法在大规模、丰富图结构上显著优于基线方法，性能大幅提升同时大幅减少场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher查询语言作为3D场景图的接口，能够显著扩展到大型、丰富的图结构，在本地和云端模型上都表现出色，为自然语言接地任务带来巨大性能改进。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

TL;DR: 提出了针对病理学基础模型的通用可转移对抗扰动(UTAP)，这是一种固定且微弱的噪声模式，能够系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>

Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，为模型鲁棒性评估建立高标准基准，推动防御机制发展，确保AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署。

Method: 通过深度学习优化生成固定且微弱的噪声模式(UTAP)，该扰动具有通用性和可转移性，能够跨不同视野和数据集应用，并能成功降低各种外部黑盒病理学基础模型的性能。

Result: 在各种最先进的病理学基础模型和多个数据集上系统评估UTAP，使用固定噪声模式对输入图像进行视觉不可察觉的修改，导致模型性能显著下降。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，其开发为模型鲁棒性评估建立了关键的高标准基准，强调了推进防御机制的必要性，并可能为对抗训练提供必要资产。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Result: 在所有指标上达到SOTA性能，精度提升18%，在不同通道深度下推理速度均优于当前SOTA模型。

Conclusion: HYDRA方法有效解决了先前光谱重建模型的关键限制，实现了高质量的光谱重建。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

Method: 提出MSSR双智能体框架：感知智能体使用感知工具箱程序化查询3D场景提取充分信息（包括新颖的SOG模块），推理智能体迭代精炼信息以追求最小化，在闭环中剪枝冗余细节并请求缺失信息，直到构建出最小充分信息集。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了空间推理性能，还产生了可解释的推理路径，为未来模型提供了高质量训练数据的来源。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Motivation: OCT成像中固有的散斑噪声和临床环境限制使得获取成对的干净-噪声图像数据集非常困难，需要开发仅使用噪声图像的自监督去噪方法

Method: SDPA++框架：首先通过自融合和自监督去噪生成伪真值图像，然后使用基于块的策略训练集成去噪模型

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实世界数据集上验证，通过CNR、MSR、TP和EP等指标显示性能提升，该数据集仅包含噪声OCT图像而无干净参考

Conclusion: 该方法在仅有噪声图像的情况下有效提升OCT图像质量，具有改善临床诊断结果的潜力

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨领域的类内连接性，成功解决了对比学习在领域泛化中的性能下降问题，为领域泛化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code

Conclusion: HumanCM证明了在人体运动预测任务中，一致性模型可以替代扩散模型，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

*Jianbiao Mei,Yu Yang,Xuemeng Yang,Licheng Wen,Jiajun Lv,Botian Shi,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IR-WM是一个隐式残差世界模型，专注于建模世界的当前状态和演化，通过预测残差变化来避免冗余建模静态背景，在nuScenes基准测试中在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的端到端自动驾驶系统依赖视觉中心的世界模型，但这些模型通常完全重建未来场景，浪费大量容量在冗余建模静态背景上。

Method: IR-WM首先从视觉观察建立当前状态的鸟瞰图表示，然后利用前一时刻的BEV特征作为时间先验，仅预测基于自车动作和场景上下文的残差变化。还应用对齐模块来校准语义和动态不对齐问题。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面取得了顶尖性能。

Conclusion: 隐式残差世界模型通过专注于建模变化而非完整重建，有效提高了自动驾驶系统的预测和规划能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出UKANFormer模型，在Allen Coral Atlas的噪声监督下实现高精度珊瑚礁语义分割，挑战了数据质量直接限制模型性能的传统观念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全球珊瑚礁分布产品（如Allen Coral Atlas）在空间精度和语义一致性方面存在局限，特别是在需要精细边界划分的区域。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，在解码器中引入全局-局部变换器（GL-Trans）模块，同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节。

Result: 珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度83.98%，在相同噪声标签设置下优于传统基线模型，预测结果在视觉和结构上都比训练用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展的珊瑚礁制图，为生态监测提供了基础。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

TL;DR: 研究表明，离散的自回归视觉模型比连续扩散模型更适合推理时搜索优化，波束搜索能让2B参数的自回归模型超越12B参数的扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索在语言模型中取得了成功，但在图像生成领域应用有限，现有方法对扩散模型效果不佳，需要探索更适合视觉生成的架构。

Method: 在离散的自回归视觉模型上应用波束搜索，利用离散token空间的优势进行早期剪枝和计算重用，并分析验证器在速度与推理能力间的权衡。

Result: 波束搜索显著提升文本到图像生成质量，2B参数的自回归模型在多个基准测试中超越12B参数的扩散模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而非仅规模）对视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型比连续扩散模型更适合搜索策略。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式图像超分辨率模型能力的提升，它们产生伪影的倾向也在增加。这些伪影对人类观察者的影响程度不同，应该根据其显著性而非统一处理为二元缺陷。

Method: 构建了一个包含11种当代图像SR方法产生的1302个伪影示例的数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分。基于此数据集训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 训练的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够产生空间显著性热图。

Conclusion: 该研究为SR伪影的显著性感知评估和缓解提供了数据集和工具，强调了根据人类感知的显著性来表征伪影的重要性。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法在图像恢复中受限于小感受野和缺乏通道特征建模，难以充分恢复精细纹理细节。

Method: 提出GMWTConvs扩大感受野提取特征，MCAM模块捕获通道间长程依赖，MTELoss损失函数指导纹理结构保持。

Conclusion: WaMaIR通过结合大感受野特征提取、通道长程依赖建模和纹理增强损失，有效解决了图像恢复中的纹理细节重建问题。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理图像区域，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑不一致、过渡不自然或整体连贯性丧失

Method: 引入双层级引导机制：区域在完整图像上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整个图像与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果

Conclusion: 通过多层级语义对齐，实现了精确协调的图像编辑，使每个区域都能理解其在全局图像上下文中的角色

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成模型主要依赖LLM，对预训练视觉基础模型和高级微调技术探索有限，且忽视了非Transformer架构如Mamba网络的潜力。

Method: 将X光图像分块标记化，通过SSM-based视觉骨干网络提取特征，使用Partial LoRA进行参数高效微调，结合混合解码器的LLM生成报告。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上进行了广泛实验，完全验证了所提策略对X光医疗报告生成的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过参数高效微调Mamba网络，实现了端到端训练，在基准数据集上取得了强劲结果。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法依赖2D-3D特征对应，在纹理缺失物体和变化光照条件下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 提出基于束调整原理的姿态回归算法，利用Lie代数扩展3DGS构建姿态可微渲染管道，通过迭代优化输入图像与渲染图像的差异来估计姿态，同时更新3DGS模型的颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的精度提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合3DGS和束调整原理，有效解决了纹理缺失和光照变化下的6D姿态估计问题，显著提升了估计精度。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

Motivation: 现有方法需要微调模型以产生与掩码解码器兼容的输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: 在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头，通过精炼注意力图中嵌入的空间线索来提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点状特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重新训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了一个高效强大的范式，为构建真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Motivation: 消除对昂贵人工标注数据集的依赖，实现可扩展的无监督道路分割，适用于自动驾驶场景。

Method: 基于几何先验生成弱标签（地平线以上为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并利用互信息最大化增强时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上达到0.82的IoU，显示出高准确性和时间稳定性。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性为自动驾驶中的可扩展无监督道路分割提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 摄影风格是著名摄影师魅力的体现，但学习和迁移摄影风格需要深入理解照片从原始状态到最终效果的编辑过程。现有方法要么无法从参考图像中学习有意义的摄影概念，要么无法保持内容图像的内容。

Method: 基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型，使用文本反演技术优化摄影概念的提示词，学习参考图像的摄影风格。生成先验使PIF能够学习摄影概念的平均外观，并根据文本提示调整它们。

Result: PIF在提取和迁移各种摄影风格方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效解决摄影风格学习和迁移的问题，在保持内容图像内容的同时成功提取和转移参考图像的摄影风格。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

on labor. High-quality data are essential for developing such harvesting
robots. However, there are currently no consistently and comprehensively
annotated open-source lychee datasets featuring fruits in natural growing
environments. To address this, we constructed a dataset to facilitate lychee
detection and maturity classification. Color (RGB) images were acquired under
diverse weather conditions, and at different times of the day, across multiple
lychee varieties, such as Nuomici, Feizixiao, Heiye, and Huaizhi. The dataset
encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth
images. The images are annotated with 9,658 pairs of lables for lychee
detection and maturity classification. To improve annotation consistency, three
individuals independently labeled the data, and their results were then
aggregated and verified by a fourth reviewer. Detailed statistical analyses
were done to examine the dataset. Finally, we performed experiments using three
representative deep learning models to evaluate the dataset. It is publicly
available for academic

TL;DR: ReefNet是一个大型公开珊瑚礁图像数据集，包含约92.5万个属级硬珊瑚注释，映射到世界海洋物种名录，旨在推动珊瑚礁自动监测技术的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于气候变化等人为压力导致珊瑚礁快速衰退，迫切需要可扩展的自动化监测方法。现有数据集在规模、地理范围或标签粒度上存在限制，且不适合机器学习应用。

Method: 整合了76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像，提供细粒度、分类学映射的标签。提出两种评估设置：源内基准测试和跨源基准测试，分别测试局部性能和领域泛化能力。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但在跨域时性能急剧下降；零样本模型在所有情况下表现均较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似的属。

Conclusion: ReefNet提供了一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类的进展，将发布数据集、基准代码和预训练模型以支持全球珊瑚礁监测和保护。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，通过纹理特征实现跨域木材碎片水分含量预测，准确率提升23%达到80%，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统烘箱干燥法耗时且破坏样本，现有间接方法在木材来源多样时准确性不足，需要解决源材料变异性对数据驱动模型的影响。

Method: 分析五种纹理特征，提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征在不同木材源数据间传递知识，并基于调整互信息设计模型保存准则。

Result: 组合五种纹理特征达到95%准确率；AdaptMoist方法使跨域预测准确率从57%提升至80%，改进23%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist是跨域木材碎片水分含量估计的稳健解决方案，对依赖木材碎片的行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2DGS-R提出了一种分层训练方法，在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，通过正常一致性正则化、原地克隆操作和透明度冻结微调来实现这一目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在渲染质量上表现出色但难以准确表示表面，而2D高斯泼溅在几何保真度上有进步但渲染质量受损。目前无法在单一训练阶段同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练方法：首先用正常一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原地克隆操作；最后在透明度冻结的情况下微调模型。

Result: 相比原始2DGS，仅需1%额外存储和最小额外训练时间，实现了高质量渲染结果同时保持精细几何结构。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器上的最优解决方案，在分布式安全基础设施中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

TL;DR: BARL是一个半监督医学图像分割框架，通过在表示空间和标签空间同时进行对齐，显著提升了分割性能，在多个数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，但忽视了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习到既具有判别性又具有空间一致性的特征表示。

Method: 提出BARL框架，包含双路径正则化(DPR)和渐进认知偏差校正(PCBC)用于标签空间对齐，以及区域级和病灶实例匹配用于表示空间对齐。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。

Conclusion: BARL通过双边对齐策略有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，消融研究验证了各组件的贡献。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于配准的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准与基于记忆库的异常检测相结合，通过联合优化配准和表征学习来提高3D点云异常检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于记忆库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些问题会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化点云配准和异常检测。该方法利用两个任务都依赖局部几何结构建模和跨样本特征相似性的特点。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过将点云配准与异常检测相结合，可以学习到既对旋转鲁棒又对异常检测有效的特征，显著提高了3D点云异常检测的性能。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经元级别的分析框架，通过人类大脑活动研究视觉语言模型的多模态信息处理机制，发现人工神经元与生物神经元在多个功能网络中具有共享表征机制和功能冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽视了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 结合细粒度人工神经元分析和基于fMRI的体素编码，研究两种架构不同的视觉语言模型（CLIP和METER），通过神经元级别分析框架探索多模态信息处理机制。

Result: 发现四个关键结果：1) ANs能成功预测多个功能网络中的BNs活动；2) ANs和BNs都表现出功能冗余；3) ANs表现出与BNs平行的极性模式；4) CLIP和METER的架构驱动不同的BNs模式。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型中存在类脑层次处理提供了有力证据，表明在神经元级别存在共享的神经信息处理机制。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Motivation: 传统的监督微调方法在指令图像编辑中容易过拟合到标注模式，限制了模型在训练分布之外的探索和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Edit-R1是一个模型无关的框架，能够有效提升指令图像编辑模型的泛化能力，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架为未来尾迹-航班关联研究奠定了坚实基础，支持概率分配策略和时空平滑处理。

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic

whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Di-Bregman框架，通过Bregman散度密度比匹配实现扩散模型蒸馏，提高单步生成效率并保持高视觉保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流模型生成质量高但采样计算成本昂贵，现有蒸馏方法缺乏统一的理论基础

Method: 将扩散蒸馏表述为基于Bregman散度的密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角统一多种现有目标

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文本到图像生成任务中，Di-Bregman相比反向KL蒸馏获得更好的单步FID，同时保持与教师模型相似的高视觉保真度

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是实现高效单步扩散生成的理论基础扎实且实用的方法

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

*Junhao Zhao,Zishuai Liu,Ruili Fang,Jin Lu,Linghan Zhang,Fei Dou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CARE框架，通过序列-图像对比对齐方法解决ADL识别中序列和图像表示之间的对齐问题，在三个CASAS数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADL识别方法存在表示层面的限制：序列方法保留时间顺序但对噪声敏感且缺乏空间感知，图像方法捕获全局模式但压缩时间动态并扭曲传感器布局，简单的特征融合方法无法实现两种表示视图的对齐。

Method: 提出CARE端到端框架，结合序列-图像对比对齐(SICA)和交叉熵分类，联合优化表示学习和分类。整合时间感知的噪声弹性序列编码、空间感知的频率敏感图像表示，使用联合对比-分类目标进行端到端学习。

Result: 在三个CASAS数据集上达到最先进性能：Milan 89.8%、Cairo 88.9%、Kyoto7 73.3%，并展示了对传感器故障和布局变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CARE框架通过对比对齐有效利用了序列和图像表示的互补优势，实现了可靠且鲁棒的ADL识别，在智能家居环境中具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

*Luca Zanella,Massimiliano Mancini,Yiming Wang,Alessio Tonioni,Elisa Ricci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BaGLM方法，利用大型多模态模型实现无需训练的在线视频步骤定位，通过贝叶斯滤波整合历史帧信息，在三个数据集上超越基于训练的离线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频步骤定位方法需要带标签的训练数据和离线处理，成本高且无法满足在线决策需求。本文探索如何无需训练即可在线执行VSG。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力预测步骤，开发BaGLM方法通过贝叶斯滤波整合历史帧信息，包括通过大型语言模型提取的依赖矩阵和步骤进度估计。

Result: 在线无任务特定调优的策略优于离线和基于训练的模型。BaGLM在三个数据集上表现出优于最先进基于训练的离线方法的性能。

Conclusion: BaGLM证明了利用大型多模态模型进行无需训练的在线视频步骤定位的可行性，为在线场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究探讨了不同视频特征对时间视频定位任务的影响，发现仅改变视频编码器就能显著影响模型性能，并揭示了特征互补的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间视频定位研究过于集中在少数视频表示方法上，可能导致架构过拟合。需要研究不同视频特征对经典架构的影响。

Method: 在三个基准数据集(Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions、YouCookII)上，使用基于CNN、时序推理和Transformer的视频编码器提取特征，并在经典架构上评估性能。

Result: 结果显示，仅改变视频编码器就能显著影响模型性能，同时揭示了使用某些特征时的明显模式和错误。

Conclusion: 不同视频特征之间存在明显的性能差异和互补潜力，这为未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了专用遥感基础模型优于通用视觉基础模型的观点，通过设计基准测试和训练iBOT模型，发现在小规模下专用模型并未带来一致改进。


<details>

Motivation: 研究动机是验证专用遥感基础模型是否真的比通用视觉基础模型更有用，特别是在遥感图像具有独特特征和应用需求的情况下。

Method: 设计了衡量遥感模型向低分辨率图像泛化能力的基准测试，并在MillionAID数据集上训练了iBOT自监督视觉编码器，加入了遥感特定的修改。

Result: 结果显示，在ViT-B规模下，这些预训练模型都没有比通用基线带来一致的改进。

Conclusion: 结论是在小规模情况下，专用遥感基础模型并不比通用视觉基础模型更有优势。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

TL;DR: ED-VTG是一种基于多模态大语言模型的细粒度视频时序定位方法，通过两阶段处理将文本查询转换为富含细节的句子，然后使用轻量级解码器进行精确定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用多模态大语言模型的能力来联合处理文本和视频，有效定位视频中的自然语言查询，解决直接定位时信息不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段将语言查询转换为包含缺失细节和线索的丰富句子；第二阶段使用轻量级解码器基于丰富查询的上下文表示预测准确边界。训练时使用多实例学习目标动态选择最优查询版本。

Result: 在多个时序视频定位和段落定位基准测试中达到最先进结果，显著优于所有先前提出的基于LLM的时序定位方法，在零样本评估场景中保持明显优势。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法在视频时序定位任务中表现出色，不仅超越了专门的模型，还在零样本场景中展现出强大泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

*Yutong Zhong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，在不改变推理架构的情况下提升3D定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，而忽视了3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: 采用解耦表示学习方法，将2D特征指定为语义信标用于"是什么"识别，3D特征作为空间锚点用于"在哪里"定位。包含对齐损失和伪标签损失的双目标损失函数。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2在定位精度和鲁棒性方面取得显著提升，特别是在杂乱户外场景中。

Conclusion: W2R2通过重新构建模型内部表示空间，有效解决了2D语义偏差问题，实现了更精确的3D定位，而无需修改推理架构。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Motivation: 解决真实指纹数据集收集耗时、昂贵且需要严格隐私保护的问题，通过合成指纹数据来应对生物特征数据收集中的隐私、成本和可访问性挑战。

Method: 使用条件StyleGAN2-ADA和StyleGAN3架构生成特定手指身份的高分辨率合成活体指纹，然后利用CycleGAN将这些指纹转换为模拟多种攻击材料（如EcoFlex、Play-Doh）的逼真伪造指纹。

Result: StyleGAN3模型实现了低至5的FID分数，生成的指纹在0.01%错误接受率下达到99.47%的真实接受率；StyleGAN2-ADA模型在相同条件下达到98.67%的真实接受率。匹配实验确认了强大的隐私保护特性，无显著身份泄露证据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功创建了高质量的合成指纹数据集，在保持强隐私保护的同时，为开发鲁棒的伪造检测系统提供了重要资源，解决了真实指纹数据收集的挑战。

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个临床医生参与循环的深度学习管道，用于肺癌CT图像分割和预后预测。VNet模型在分割性能、放射组学稳定性和预测准确性方面表现最佳，半监督学习优于监督学习，临床医生更倾向于使用AI生成的初始掩模进行精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像在筛查、预后和治疗中至关重要。手动分割存在变异性大且耗时的问题，而深度学习虽然提供自动化但面临临床采用障碍。

Method: 使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，比较了5种深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D），在完整图像和点击裁剪图像上与专家轮廓进行基准测试。评估了497个放射组学特征的分割可重复性，比较了监督学习和半监督学习在38种降维策略和24种分类器下的预后建模。6名医生在7个领域对掩模进行定性评估。

Result: VNet实现了最佳性能（Dice = 0.83，IoU = 0.71）、放射组学稳定性（平均相关性 = 0.76，ICC = 0.65）和SSL下的预测准确性（准确率 = 0.88，F1 = 0.83）。SSL在所有模型中一致优于SL。放射科医生因VNet的瘤周表现和平滑边界而偏爱它，更倾向于使用AI生成的初始掩模进行精炼而非完全替换。

Conclusion: 将VNet与SSL结合可产生准确、可重复且临床可信的基于CT的肺癌预后结果，突显了实现以医生为中心的AI转化的可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Result: 该方法在所有情况下都显著改进了当代结果，在准确率和平均精度之间取得了良好平衡

Conclusion: 该广义选择方法能够超越现有技术水平，为行人重识别任务提供更优的类表示选择策略

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Motivation: 现有视频推理LMM依赖昂贵的RL训练和冗长的思维链，计算成本高且推理过程控制机制有限。

Method: 使用模型输出熵作为信号，发现高质量模型经历微探索和微利用过程。在推理时通过小型可训练控制器基于熵目标优化LMM的值缓存。

Conclusion: 基于熵的推理时优化能有效提升视频推理性能，无需额外训练即可获得接近RL模型的效果，且大幅提升效率。

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

TL;DR: 比较通用视觉基础模型Hiera与专用分割模型SAM2的特征通用性，发现专用化虽然提升空间相关任务性能，但在概念距离较远的任务上表现不佳，存在可量化的信息损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究通用基础视觉模型与专用模型之间的权衡关系，为高效特征编码设计提供理论基础，目前这一权衡尚未被充分理解。

Method: 使用轻量级可训练neck模块来探测冻结特征的适应性，通过信息论成本量化专用化的代价，并进行跨neck分析。

Result: SAM2在深度估计等空间相关任务上表现优异，但在姿态估计和图像描述等概念距离较远的任务上表现不如通用模型Hiera，显示出语义信息的损失。

Conclusion: 专用化存在明确的权衡：提升特定任务性能的同时会损失通用语义信息，每个适应层级都会产生表示瓶颈，为多样化下游应用的特征编码设计提供量化基础。

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a
quantitative foundation for designing efficient feature coding and adaptation
strategies for diverse downstream applications.

*Zhe Luo,Wenjing Jia,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ProDAT方法，一种基于密度感知的渐进式点云编码技术，支持单一模型实现多比特率渐进解码，显著提升编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了在资源受限环境中的高质量服务部署。现有学习型点云几何编码方法的固定潜在表示不支持渐进解码。

Method: 提出密度感知的尾丢弃机制(ProDAT)，利用密度信息作为指导信号，根据重要性自适应解码潜在特征和坐标，实现单一模型的多比特率渐进解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验结果表明，ProDAT不仅支持渐进编码，而且在编码效率上优于现有最先进的学习型编码技术，在SemanticKITTI上PSNR-D2的BD-rate提升超过28.6%，在ShapeNet上提升超过18.15%。

Conclusion: ProDAT成功解决了点云渐进编码问题，在保持高编码效率的同时实现了灵活的渐进解码能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FMCAF预处理架构，通过频域滤波和跨注意力融合来增强RGB和红外图像的多模态目标检测性能，在多个数据集上表现优于传统融合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态目标检测在挑战性条件下通过利用多个传感器模态的互补线索来提高鲁棒性。需要一种通用的融合方法来提升不同多模态挑战的性能，而不需要针对特定数据集进行调优。

Method: FMCAF包含频域滤波块(Freq-Filter)来抑制冗余频谱特征，以及基于跨注意力的融合模块(MCAF)来改善模态间特征共享。这是一种预处理架构，旨在增强RGB和红外输入的融合。

Result: 在LLVIP(低光行人检测)和VEDAI(航空车辆检测)数据集上，FMCAF优于传统融合方法(拼接)，在VEDAI上获得+13.9% mAP@50的提升，在LLVIP上获得+1.1%的提升。

Conclusion: FMCAF有潜力作为未来检测管道中稳健多模态融合的灵活基础架构，支持其在不同多模态挑战中的通用性。

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane通过引入平面先验来改进高斯泼溅的几何重建，特别针对平面区域提供更平滑精确的网格表示，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时难以达到足够的平滑度和精度，限制了在场景编辑和物理仿真等下游应用中的使用。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法向预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化表示；引入动态高斯重分类器自适应调整平面高斯；利用优化后的平面先验改进网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面数，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 平面先验的引入有效提升了高斯泼溅在平面区域的重建质量，支持场景对象的解耦和灵活操作。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对预训练扩散模型的优化策略，通过潜在空间细化和双向交互机制，在保持感知真实性的同时显著提升内容保真度，特别是在低光场景下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往以牺牲内容保真度为代价来获得更高的感知真实性，这一问题在低光场景中尤为严重。

Method: 引入潜在细化管道恢复VAE编码中丢失的空间细节，并建立条件潜在与噪声潜在之间的动态双向交互机制。

Result: 大量实验表明该方法显著提升了预训练扩散模型的保真度性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为即插即用方案，可无缝集成到现有扩散网络中提供更有效的控制，在保持真实性和美学质量的同时改善保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种使用LED环境照明生成人眼不可见但相机可检测的水印方法，通过优化LED光谱特性实现视觉不可感知性，支持在标准帧率下提取水印。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可见光通信需要高频调制，而本方法旨在开发一种视觉不可感知的水印技术，用于隐私保护和内容验证，同时能在普通消费相机上工作。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，联合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱响应和LED产生白光的特性，优化LED光谱配置以实现不可见水印嵌入。

Result: 成功实现了在10秒视频片段中嵌入128位信息的水印，虽然传输速率有限，但足以支持基本的元数据需求，且能在30-60fps标准帧率下提取。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私保护和内容验证提供了一种实用的视觉不可感知水印解决方案，平衡了不可感知性和检测可靠性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

TL;DR: 提出了GOOD框架，通过双重引导机制生成多样化的OOD样本，显著提升OOD检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定性和多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: 使用现成的ID分类器直接引导扩散采样轨迹，包含图像级引导（基于对数分割梯度）和特征级引导（基于k-NN距离），并提出了统一OOD评分

Result: GOOD生成的样本能显著提升OOD检测性能，经过定量和定性分析验证了其有效性

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过双重引导机制实现了更可控和多样化的OOD样本生成，为OOD检测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KineDiff3D是一个统一的框架，通过运动学感知扩散模型从单视角输入重建铰接物体形状并估计姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接物体（如笔记本电脑和抽屉）由于其多部件几何结构和可变关节配置，在3D重建和姿态估计方面面临挑战，这些因素在不同状态下引入了结构多样性。

Method: 首先通过运动学感知VAE将完整几何、关节角度和部件分割编码到结构化潜在空间；然后使用两个条件扩散模型分别回归全局姿态和关节参数，以及从部分观测生成运动学感知潜在代码；最后通过迭代优化模块双向优化重建精度和运动学参数。

Conclusion: 提出的KineDiff3D框架能有效处理铰接物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，展示了在准确重建和运动学参数估计方面的优势。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Result: 在DeepCAD和Fusion360数据集上达到最先进性能，在代码有效性、几何精度和建模简洁性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACO-CAD框架有效提升了从单张图像生成CAD模型的几何准确性和建模效率，为工业设计提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Method: 研究了多种最先进的对抗攻击方法在不同预处理技术下的可迁移性，分析了人脸检测模型和插值方法的影响，并提出了基于输入变换的预处理不变方法。

Result: 人脸检测模型的选择可使攻击成功率下降高达78%，而插值方法影响相对较小。提出的预处理不变方法可将攻击可迁移性提高27%。

Conclusion: 预处理在人脸识别系统中至关重要，考虑预处理因素有助于提高面部对抗样本的对抗泛化能力。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Motivation: 解决掩码自回归模型在并行生成视觉内容时，由于空间相关视觉令牌建模复杂性导致的加速潜力受限问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：结构生成阶段建立全局语义框架，细节重建阶段高效完成剩余令牌。结合频率加权令牌选择(FTS)为图像细节分配更多计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成和文本到图像生成任务中，MAR-H模型实现3.72倍加速，同时保持可比质量(FID:1.59, IS:304.4 vs 原始1.59, 299.1)。

Conclusion: GtR方法显著优于现有加速方法，在各种模型规模和生成任务上均表现出色，为掩码自回归模型提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法假设训练和测试数据来自同一域，限制了在开放世界场景中的适用性。DG-GCD要求模型泛化到包含新类别的未见域，而现有方法DG2CD-Net计算成本高且存在误差累积。

Method: 使用GPT引导的扩散进行源域增强；引入切线CutMix进行曲率感知插值；结合惩罚Busemann对齐、混合双曲对比正则化和自适应异常值排斥的统一损失；可学习的曲率参数适应数据集复杂度。

Result: 在PACS、Office-Home和DomainNet数据集上达到最先进水平，持续优于现有的欧几里得和双曲(DG)-GCD基线方法。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习有效解决了DG-GCD问题，实现了域和类别级别的泛化，避免了模拟训练的高计算成本。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

*Pu Zhang,Yuwei Li,Xingyuan Xian,Guoming Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本的视觉token剪枝方法，通过平衡任务相关性和信息多样性，在保持性能的同时显著降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力增强，视觉token冗余导致推理成本过高，现有方法忽视了文本提示的指导，无法有效优先考虑任务相关性。

Method: 采用分层方法：先选择任务相关的核心视觉token，再补充多样性token以保留更广泛上下文，实现任务相关性与信息多样性的平衡。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，即使剪枝90%的token，性能仍能匹配或超越现有最优方法，仅造成最小精度损失，同时显著减少GPU内存占用和推理延迟。

Conclusion: 提出的提示感知视觉token剪枝方法在保持模型性能的同时，有效解决了视觉语言模型中的token冗余问题，显著降低了推理成本。

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

*M Saifuzzaman Rafat,Mohd Ruhul Ameen,Akif Islam,Abu Saleh Musa Miah,Jungpil Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)开发了一个专门用于检测孟加拉国河流侵蚀的AI模型，通过颜色通道分析和微调SAM的掩码解码器，实现了86.30%的mIoU和92.60%的Dice分数，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的主要河流既是商业和生计的动脉，也是持续破坏的媒介，每年吞噬整个村庄和大片农田，导致社区消失和数千家庭流离失所。传统人工分析这种缓慢灾难极为困难。

Method: 构建了包含2003-2025年孟加拉国脆弱地区历史Google Earth影像的新数据集，首次包含手动标注的消失定居点数据。方法包括颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水域分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。

Result: 模型在河流侵蚀检测方面表现出色，达到86.30%的平均交并比和92.60%的Dice分数，性能显著超越传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了三个关键贡献：首个孟加拉国因河流侵蚀消失定居点的标注数据集；专门针对此关键任务微调的AI模型；以及通过视觉证据量化土地损失的方法。这些工具为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了监控侵蚀、预测轨迹和保护脆弱社区的新视角。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作机制将GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理的视觉定位和执行链问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机使用代理仅依赖基本操作（点击、输入、滚动），需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联失败和性能瓶颈。这些代理与其他利用丰富程序化接口的代理隔离，无法利用API、MCP服务器等工具。

Method: 方法包含四个关键组件：(1)从软件文档、开源仓库和代码生成中扩展程序化工具的自动化流水线；(2)生成超过17,000个可验证任务的合成数据引擎；(3)大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集；(4)结合监督微调和在线强化学习的两阶段训练管道。

Result: 实验显示，7B和32B模型相比最先进代理有显著改进。在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相比基础模型平均相对改进22%，步骤速度提升11%。在WindowsAgentArena的域外评估中达到21.7%成功率，优于在Windows数据上训练的基线。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制被证明至关重要，在保持执行效率的同时减少了错误传播，成功桥接了GUI基本操作与高级程序化工具调用之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究针对FPS游戏VALORANT，通过分析比赛录像中的小地图信息构建回合结果预测模型，利用TimeSformer视频识别模型结合战术特征，在数据增强后达到约81%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志数据和统计信息，而VALORANT作为需要复杂策略的FPS游戏，需要更深入分析战术特征来提升预测准确性。

Method: 基于TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取详细战术特征（如角色位置信息和游戏内事件），构建数据增强的数据集来训练预测模型。

Result: 在数据增强后训练的模型达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中后期阶段表现显著优于仅使用小地图信息本身训练的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，证明了战术分析在电竞预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，利用视觉语言模型处理，实现3-4倍的token压缩，同时保持与领先LLM相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文LLM在扩展到百万token级别时面临的高计算和内存成本问题。

Method: 将长文本渲染为图像，使用视觉语言模型处理，并通过LLM驱动的遗传搜索优化视觉渲染配置。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中达到3-4倍token压缩，预填充和解码速度快约4倍，SFT训练快约2倍，128K上下文VLM可处理1M token任务。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文扩展是解决长上下文建模挑战的有效方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过三个关键组件解决领域差异和类别不平衡问题，在多个数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要模型能够持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学习类别的性能。现有重放方法由于领域差异和类别不平衡问题，难以有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: EndoCIL包含三个核心组件：基于最大均值差异的重放策略（MDBR）选择多样化样本，先验正则化类别平衡损失（PRCBL）缓解类别不平衡，以及全连接梯度校准（CFG）减少对新类别的偏置。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下普遍优于最先进的CIL方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在终身内窥镜诊断中有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，显示出良好的临床可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出基于DINOv2的面部欺骗攻击检测方法，通过提取可泛化特征和抑制注意力机制中的扰动来区分真实和欺骗面部图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别系统容易受到欺骗攻击，恶意行为者可能通过展示注册用户的照片来绕过认证过程，因此需要在面部识别之前检测此类欺骗攻击。

Method: 使用带寄存器的DINOv2模型提取可泛化特征，并抑制注意力机制中的扰动，从而聚焦于关键和细微特征。

Result: 在ICCV2025第六届面部反欺骗研讨会提供的统一物理-数字攻击检测数据集和SiW数据集上进行了实验验证。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测面部欺骗攻击，提高面部识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了多时刻检索（MMR）任务，构建了QV-M²数据集和FlashMMR框架，解决了现有单时刻检索方法在现实应用中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法专注于单时刻检索，但现实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，现有数据集和方法不足以支撑视频时序定位需求。

Method: 提出了FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块来精炼时刻边界，通过约束时间调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，通过精细过滤管道修剪低置信度提议。

Result: 在QV-M²数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP上提升3.00%，在mAP@3+tgt上提升2.70%，在mR@3上提升2.56%。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位场景研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 所提出的框架有效解决了深度伪造检测中的公平性和可解释性问题，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Conclusion: PnF方法通过MLLMs的零样本推理能力显著提升运动预测性能，且无需微调，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Conclusion: SG-CLDFF为临床工作流程提供了实用且可解释的自动化白细胞分析路径。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Result: YOLO模型在验证集上达到96.7% mAP@50，验证集包含带有蓝色球形标记的模拟手术场景标注图像。

Conclusion: 这种基于机器视觉的自动化照明解决方案减少了外科医生的身体负担，提高了照明一致性，有助于改善手术效果。

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

### [133] [Exploring Structural Degradation in Dense Representations for Self-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17299)
*Siran Dai,Qianqian Xu,Peisong Wen,Yang Liu,Qingming Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现自监督学习中存在一个反直觉现象：训练时间过长会损害密集预测任务的性能，称为自监督密集退化(SDD)。作者提出了DSE指标来评估无标注情况下的密集表示质量，并基于此开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中训练时间过长反而会损害密集预测任务性能的反常现象，需要解决无标注情况下如何有效评估密集表示质量的问题。

Method: 提出了DSE（密集表示结构估计器），包含类别相关性度量和有效维度度量，并基于此开发了模型选择策略和DSE正则化方法。

Result: 在16种自监督方法和4个基准测试上的实验表明，模型选择策略平均提升mIoU 3.0%，且DSE正则化能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: 自监督密集退化现象普遍存在，DSE指标能有效评估密集表示质量，提出的方法能显著提升密集预测任务性能。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

TL;DR: LongInsightBench是首个专门评估模型理解长视频能力的基准测试，重点关注人类语言、观点、行为等上下文元素，并整合视觉、音频和文本多模态信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频理解基准主要关注短视频，缺乏对长视频中复杂上下文和多模态信息整合能力的评估。

Method: 从FineVideo数据集中精选约1000个长时长、信息密集的视频，设计6个挑战性任务场景，并开发三步半自动数据质量保证流程。

Result: 实验结果显示全模态模型在精确时间定位和长距离因果推理任务上仍面临挑战，多模态融合存在信息丢失和处理偏差问题。

Conclusion: LongInsightBench为评估模型长视频理解能力提供了有效基准，揭示了当前全模态模型在复杂多模态任务中的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{LongInsightBench}, the first benchmark designed to
assess models' ability to understand long videos, with a focus on human
language, viewpoints, actions, and other contextual elements, while integrating
\textbf{visual, audio, and text} modalities. Our benchmark excels in three key
areas: \textbf{a) Long-Duration, Information-Dense Videos:} We carefully select
approximately 1,000 videos from open-source datasets FineVideo based on
duration limit and the information density of both visual and audio modalities,
focusing on content like lectures, interviews, and vlogs, which contain rich
language elements. \textbf{b) Diverse and Challenging Task Scenarios:} We have
designed six challenging task scenarios, including both Intra-Event and
Inter-Event Tasks. \textbf{c) Rigorous and Comprehensive Quality Assurance
Pipelines:} We have developed a three-step, semi-automated data quality
assurance pipeline to ensure the difficulty and validity of the synthesized
questions and answer options. Based on LongInsightBench, we designed a series
of experiments. Experimental results shows that Omni-modal models(OLMs) still
face challenge in tasks requiring precise temporal localization (T-Loc) and
long-range causal inference (CE-Caus). Extended experiments reveal the
information loss and processing bias in multi-modal fusion of OLMs. Our dataset

*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过BOLD信号去卷积和因果图推断两阶段方法，解决了传统方法在神经因果推断中的计算难题和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的两个基本限制：从血流动力学扭曲的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性质，以及现有方法（如动态因果建模）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂的逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD去卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率提高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中恢复已知神经通路的保真度达88%，而传统方法在99%以上的受试者中无法识别这些典型回路。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了实用的工具，能够在大规模因果推断中捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有对抗防御方法对抗对抗性服装的效果，发现这些防御方法在面对大覆盖面积的对抗性服装时表现不佳，揭示了现有防御系统的共同漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验表明，简单地增大对抗补丁的尺寸就能使现有的防御方法失效。对抗性服装不仅尺寸大，而且在人体上看起来更自然，为评估对抗防御方法提供了良好的测试案例。

Method: 通过制作对抗性服装，在数字世界和物理世界中测试多种防御方法的效果，并针对Faster R-CNN制作了一套能突破多种防御方法的服装。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗性服装面前表现都很差。制作的一套对抗性服装在物理世界中，对未防御的检测器攻击成功率达到96.06%，对九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗防御方法在面对大覆盖面积的对抗性服装时存在共同漏洞，需要开发更强大的防御机制来应对这类攻击。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，使用字符级引导的扩散模型来恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，在恢复质量和识别准确率上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对车牌识别系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度，并促进车牌图像的进一步利用。需要解决现实条件下捕获的严重退化车牌图像的恢复问题。

Method: CharDiff框架利用外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符级先验，并引入字符引导注意力通过区域掩码(CHARM)模块，确保每个字符的引导仅限制在其自身区域，避免与其他区域干扰。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，CharDiff相比性能最佳的基线模型实现了28%的相对CER降低，在恢复质量和识别准确率方面显著优于基线恢复模型。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

Method: 提出后处理的OSR方法，基于输入到最近类均值的距离构建概率分布，然后与logit空间的softmax概率进行比较，衡量NCM与分类头之间的一致性。

Result: 在两个评估数据集中排名前三，在两个数据集上表现一致，而当前最先进方法通常只在单个数据集上表现优异。非洲和瑞典动物的AUROC分别达到93.41和95.35。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的后处理开放集识别策略，无需重新训练预训练模型，在野生动物分类中实现了稳定且优异的性能。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将视觉语义知识从帧模态转移到事件模态，显著提升事件到视频重建的质量和语义信息恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机仅捕获强度变化，忽略静态物体和背景，导致事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有E2V方法往往忽视语义信息在视频重建中的重要作用。

Method: 1. 跨模态特征对齐模块将SAM模型的视觉语义转移到事件编码器；2. 语义感知特征融合块集成学习到的语义特征；3. 语义感知E2V监督利用SAM生成的类别标签指导语义细节重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升帧质量，优于最先进的E2V方法。

Conclusion: Semantic-E2VID通过有效利用视觉语义知识，成功解决了事件到视频重建中语义信息缺失的问题，为事件视觉任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: M2H作为单目空间感知系统的基础，支持动态环境中的3D场景图构建，并在真实世界数据上验证了实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多面部表情特征融合的帕金森病严重程度诊断方法，通过注意力机制融合多种表情特征，并采用自适应类别平衡策略解决类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情类型易导致误诊，且忽视不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，大多仅进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断。

Method: 集成多种面部表情特征通过注意力机制进行特征融合，采用自适应类别平衡策略根据类别分布和分类难度动态调整训练样本贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略均有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效诊断PD严重程度，多表情特征融合和自适应平衡策略显著提升了诊断性能。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过观察他人与物体的互动来学习新物体的交互方式。现有的弱监督交互感知方法仅从外中心图像单向转移到自我中心图像，在复杂交互场景中应用受限。

Method: 提出LoopTrans闭环框架，包含统一跨模态定位和去噪知识蒸馏机制，桥接物体中心的自我中心图像和交互中心的外中心图像之间的领域差距。

Result: 实验表明，LoopTrans在图像和视频基准测试的所有指标上均取得一致改进，甚至能处理人体完全遮挡物体交互区域的挑战性场景。

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过双向知识转移有效提升了交互感知能力，在复杂交互场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge

*Dmitrii Galimzianov,Viacheslav Vyshegorodtsev,Ivan Nezhivykh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于视觉的自动化系统，用于监测马厩中马匹和人的行为，使用YOLOv11和BoT-SORT进行目标检测和跟踪，能够识别五种事件类型并处理摄像头盲区。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统马匹行为监测方法劳动密集且耗时，需要自动化系统来早期发现健康福利问题。

Method: 使用YOLOv11进行目标检测，BoT-SORT进行多目标跟踪，基于目标轨迹和空间关系推断事件状态，利用CLIP和GroundingDINO构建自定义数据集。

Result: 定性评估显示系统在马匹相关事件检测上表现可靠，但人员检测因数据不足存在局限。

Conclusion: 该工作为马场实时行为监测奠定了基础，对动物福利和厩舍管理具有重要意义。

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

*Shaharyar Ahmed Khan Tareen,Filza Khan Tareen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepDetect是一个智能、一体化的密集关键点检测器，通过融合传统检测器输出并训练轻量级ESPNet模型，在关键点密度、重复性和正确匹配数方面超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关键点检测器（SIFT、SURF等）和学习方法（SuperPoint等）存在对光度变化敏感、关键点密度低、重复性差、适应性有限以及缺乏语义理解等问题。

Method: 融合7种关键点检测器和2种边缘检测器的输出创建真实掩码，然后使用这些掩码作为标签训练轻量级ESPNet模型。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上，DeepDetect在关键点密度（0.5143）、重复性（0.9582）和正确匹配数（59,003）方面达到最大值，超越其他检测器。

Conclusion: DeepDetect通过深度学习统一传统检测器的优势，能够语义地关注图像并产生高密度关键点，适应各种视觉退化条件。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

TL;DR: 利用AV1运动向量生成密集亚像素对应关系和经过余弦一致性过滤的短轨迹，在压缩域前端实现与SIFT相当的性能但CPU使用更少，在SfM演示中成功重建了数十万个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索压缩域对应关系作为资源高效的前端方法，为完整流程提供可扩展的路径，减少计算资源消耗

Method: 重新利用AV1运动向量生成密集亚像素对应关系，通过余弦一致性过滤短轨迹，在压缩域进行前端处理

Result: 在短视频上运行性能与顺序SIFT相当但CPU使用少得多，产生更密集的匹配和具有竞争力的成对几何关系；在117帧剪辑的SfM演示中，MV匹配注册所有图像并重建46-62万个点，重投影误差0.51-0.53像素

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是一个实用且资源高效的前端方法，具有在完整流程中扩展的清晰路径

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨面临场景复杂性和高质量数据集缺乏的挑战，现有数据集无法准确反映雨和光照的耦合效应。

Method: 开发了CST-Net网络，包含可学习的颜色空间转换器(CSC)在Y通道进行雨滴去除，并引入隐式光照引导来捕获光照信息。

Result: 提出的HQ-NightRain数据集具有更高的和谐性和真实性，CST-Net在复杂夜间场景中表现出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为夜间图像去雨提供了高质量基准数据集和有效方法，实验验证了数据集和方法的有效性。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)初始化的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来提升稀疏视图下的3D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3DGS容易过拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法要么增强初始化，要么添加训练时约束，但研究发现初始化是决定性因素，决定了性能上限。

Method: 1) 频率感知SfM：通过低频视图增强和宽松多视图对应改进低纹理区域覆盖；2) 3DGS自初始化：利用光度监督生成额外点，补偿SfM稀疏区域；3) 点云正则化：通过几何/可见性先验确保多视图一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升，成为更强的初始化策略。

Conclusion: 初始化是稀疏视图3DGS的关键因素，提出的方法通过改进SfM和点云质量，显著提升了稀疏视图下的3D重建性能。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知灵活性，且基于网格的"原位分类"与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配问题。

Method: 使用稀疏动态查询，包含范围自适应感知模块（通过自车状态调制可学习查询并增强时空关联）和状态条件预测模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测）。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务上达到最先进性能，验证了在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询实现了灵活、自适应且高效的4D占用世界建模，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

TL;DR: POTNet通过熵引导的双聚类头改进原型最优传输，在无监督显著目标检测中实现接近监督方法的性能，无需像素级标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督显著目标检测方法在缺乏可靠伪掩码时性能受限，原型质量弱时最优传输的全局一致性未被充分利用。

Method: 提出POTNet，用熵引导的双聚类头替代单一k-means：高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means，两组原型通过最优传输对齐，生成更清晰的伪掩码。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，AutoSOD比无监督方法F-measure提升26%，比弱监督方法提升36%，大幅缩小与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过改进原型生成和最优传输对齐，无监督显著目标检测可以达到接近监督方法的精度，无需像素级标注。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

*Yuanli Wu,Long Zhang,Yue Du,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，通过将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，构建结构化、数据集自适应的评分标准来指导可解释的场景评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高级语义和细粒度叙事线索，零样本提示方法对人工提示模板敏感且依赖数据集特定的分数归一化。

Method: 使用评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为伪标签并聚合成评分标准。推理时，首尾片段仅基于描述评分，中间片段结合相邻场景的上下文摘要来评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越了无监督和先前的零样本基线方法，接近监督方法的性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签有效稳定了基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用、可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Conclusion: 成功开发并开源了完整的大规模视频生成训练堆栈，首次公开利用Megatron-Core实现高效训练的多节点扩展代码。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node

Result: 在纵向主动监测数据集上显著优于最先进的U-Net和Transformer模型，在有限和噪声数据下实现优越的前列腺区域分割

Conclusion: MambaX-Net为前列腺癌主动监测提供了一种有效的半监督纵向分割解决方案

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Motivation: 减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，实现智能基础设施维护中的道路裂缝检测。

Method: 集成三个组件：分类器生成类激活图(CAMs)，重建器测量特征可推断性，检测器生成像素级检测结果；使用路径感知注意力模块(PAAM)融合高低层特征，以及中心增强CAM一致性模块(CECCM)优化伪标签生成。

Result: 在三个图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到与监督方法相当的结果，并优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著推进了可扩展的道路检测，源代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含动态元素（如移动人物、可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息：抑制运动线索用于姿态估计，增强运动线索用于几何重建。

Result: 在动态场景中持续优于原始VGGT，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计、密集点图重建方面取得更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了动态场景中多任务重建的内在冲突，无需后处理即可实现4D重建任务。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断变化的视觉环境，特别是在物体外观随时间变化的领域。汽车模型作为技术制品的代表性类别，其时间演变过程需要被研究。

Result: 静态预训练在域内数据上能达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但在跨年测试时准确率下降；时间增量策略能改善时间鲁棒性；时间感知图像生成能产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时间适应问题提供了丰富的基准，时间增量学习策略能有效应对现实世界中的持续学习场景。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个水下伪装实例分割数据集UCIS4K和基于SAM的UCIS-SAM网络，通过三个关键模块解决水下环境中的颜色失真、低对比度和模糊问题，在伪装实例分割任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪装实例分割方法在陆地数据集上训练，水下样本有限，在水下场景中性能不足。水下环境的颜色失真、低对比度和模糊特性使伪装实例分割面临更大挑战。

Conclusion: UCIS4K数据集和UCIS-SAM网络有效解决了水下伪装实例分割的挑战，通过专门设计的水下特征增强和频率域处理机制，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

*Sébastien Thuau,Siba Haidar,Ayush Bajracharya,Rachid Chelouah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了两种节俭的联邦学习方法用于暴力检测：基于视觉语言模型的零样本和联邦微调，以及个性化训练的紧凑3D卷积神经网络。两种方法在非IID设置下均达到90%以上准确率，CNN3D在ROC AUC和能量效率方面表现更优，而VLM在上下文推理方面更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是开发资源高效的联邦学习方法来检测暴力行为，特别关注能源效率和环境可持续性，为视频监控提供负责任的人工智能解决方案。

Method: 使用两种互补策略：(i) 基于LLaVA-7B的视觉语言模型的零样本和联邦微调（使用LoRA），(ii) 个性化训练6580万参数的紧凑3D卷积神经网络，在非IID设置下评估准确率、校准和能耗。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss方面略优于LoRA微调的VLM，且能耗更低。VLM在上下文推理和多模态推理方面保持优势。量化了训练和推理阶段的能耗及二氧化碳排放。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量级CNN用于常规分类，选择性激活VLM处理复杂场景。该框架为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShapeCraft是一个多智能体框架，将3D资产表示为形状程序，通过图结构程序化形状表示将复杂自然语言分解为子任务图，生成结构化、可交互的3D模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到3D生成方法产生的非结构化网格和交互性差的问题，使其更适合艺术工作流程。

Method: 提出基于图的程序化形状表示，使用LLM智能体分层解析用户输入初始化GPS，然后迭代优化程序化建模和绘制过程。

Result: 定性和定量实验显示ShapeCraft在生成几何准确和语义丰富的3D资产方面优于现有基于LLM的方法，支持动画和用户定制编辑。

Conclusion: ShapeCraft展示了在更广泛交互应用中的潜力，能够生成结构化、纹理化和可交互的3D资产。

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

### [162] [PICABench: How Far Are We from Physically Realistic Image Editing?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17681)
*Yuandong Pu,Le Zhuo,Songhao Han,Jinbo Xing,Kaiwen Zhu,Shuo Cao,Bin Fu,Si Liu,Hongsheng Li,Yu Qiao,Wenlong Zhang,Xi Chen,Yihao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PICABench基准和PICAEval评估协议，用于系统评估图像编辑的物理真实性，涵盖8个物理维度，并构建了PICA-100K训练数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽视了物理效果的真实性，如移除物体时未能同时移除其阴影、反射等物理效应。

Method: 引入PICABench基准系统评估物理真实性，提出PICAEval评估协议使用VLM作为评判器，并构建PICA-100K数据集从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现物理真实性仍是一个具有挑战性的问题，存在很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 该基准和解决方案为从简单内容编辑向物理一致性真实感的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

*Siqi Chen,Shanyue Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的3D点云自动分割框架，结合无人机扫描的真实点云和BIM生成的合成数据，解决基础设施模型分割中手动标注耗时且易错的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机技术结合摄影测量能高效获取基础设施的3D模型，但传统手动分割结构组件耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用机器学习框架，结合真实无人机扫描点云和BIM生成的合成数据，通过互补优势克服手动标注限制。

Result: 在铁轨数据集验证中，对轨道和枕木等主要组件实现了高精度识别和分割；使用小规模数据集结合BIM数据显著减少训练时间同时保持合理分割精度。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法提高了3D基础设施模型分割的精度和效率，推动了无人机与BIM技术在结构健康监测和基础设施管理中的集成应用。

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割基础模型微调方法存在两个问题：1）高层特征表示不足；2）微调过程破坏了预训练权重的结构完整性。

Method: 1）构建基础专家、语义专家和自适应专家，采用像素概率自适应投票策略进行专家选择和融合；2）提出语义引导对比学习方法解决对比学习中弱监督问题。

Conclusion: IC-MoE有效补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征表示能力，同时保持了预训练权重的结构完整性，并在多样化医学图像分割场景中表现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dinomaly2是一个统一的图像异常检测框架，通过五个简单元素的组合在标准重建框架中实现卓越性能，在多类、多模态和少样本任务中均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多类异常检测模型性能显著落后于一对一模型，且该领域已分裂为针对特定场景的专门方法，需要统一的解决方案。

Method: 采用"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，实现方法简约化，无需修改即可自然扩展到多样化任务。

Result: 在12个异常检测基准测试中表现出全谱优势，多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的图像级AUROC，少样本场景下仅用8个正常样本就超越之前全样本模型。

Conclusion: 简约设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性的结合使Dinomaly2成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

Motivation: 解决文本-图像人物检索中的模态异质性问题，现有方法要么忽略细粒度差异，要么需要先验信息进行局部对齐，且当前方法主要针对英语，限制了在多语言环境中的应用。

Method: 提出Bi-IRRA框架，包含双向隐式关系推理模块（通过掩码图像和文本的双向预测来隐式增强跨语言和跨模态的局部关系建模）和多维全局对齐模块（桥接模态异质性）。

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架通过双向隐式关系推理和多维全局对齐，有效解决了多语言文本-图像人物检索中的模态异质性问题，为多语言环境下的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Conclusion: 自监督学习在高分辨率DEM衍生物上具有潜力，可在植被茂密且标注稀缺的遗产环境中实现干石墙的自动映射。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world

Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，原始图像方法在当前表现更好，但壳预处理方法为未来开发稳健的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

TL;DR: 提出基于双编码器和注意力的皮肤病变分类框架，结合精确的病灶分割和临床元数据，在提高准确率的同时增强模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测对患者预后至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑箱"问题，临床信任度低。需要解决病灶分割精度和模型可解释性不足的问题。

Method: 使用带双注意力门和ASPP的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割，然后采用双DenseNet201编码器分别处理原始图像和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征，并集成基于Transformer的患者元数据模块。

Result: 在HAM10000、ISIC 2018和2019数据集上取得最先进的分割性能，显著提升分类准确率和平均AUC，Grad-CAM热图验证模型关注病灶区域而非背景伪特征。

Conclusion: 结合精确病灶分割、临床数据和注意力融合机制，能够构建更准确且可解释的皮肤癌分类模型，增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法在开放世界场景中泛化能力不足，传统闭集检测器无法处理未见过的物体，而直接应用3D开放词汇模型又面临词汇扩展和语义重叠问题。

Method: 提出OP3Det，结合2D基础模型的强泛化能力和零样本能力，利用2D语义先验和3D几何先验生成类别无关的提议，通过跨模态专家混合动态路由单模态和多模态特征来学习广义3D物体性。

Conclusion: OP3Det通过有效结合2D和3D先验，实现了广义3D物体发现，在开放世界3D检测任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Result: 在相似资源约束下，相比现有求解器训练方法表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 广义对抗求解器提供了一种简单有效的方法来加速扩散模型采样，同时保持高质量的细节生成。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型只有有限的预定义尺寸，无法适应实际部署中的计算约束，需要一种能够生成弹性模型的剪枝方法。

Method: 结合梯度信息和跨网络结构相关性，使用进化算法近似Hessian非对角结构，采用自监督重要性评分机制，无需分类头。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于分析循环血细胞簇（CCCs）图像的计算框架，通过YOLOv11模型分类细胞簇图像，并结合多通道荧光染色识别细胞类型，准确率超过95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式细胞术结合荧光染色常用于分析细胞簇，但现有机器学习方法主要针对单细胞分析，缺乏自动分析细胞簇图像的工具。细胞簇形状不规则、大小不一且包含异质细胞类型，需要多通道染色识别。

Method: 采用两步分析策略：1）使用YOLOv11模型对图像进行细胞簇与非细胞簇分类；2）通过叠加细胞簇轮廓与多通道荧光染色区域来识别细胞类型，克服细胞碎片和染色伪影的影响。

Result: 在细胞簇分类和表型识别方面均达到超过95%的准确率，优于传统CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 该自动化框架有效分析流式细胞术中的CCC图像，利用明场和荧光数据，最初在血细胞上测试，具有分析免疫细胞和肿瘤细胞簇等更广泛应用的潜力。

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

TL;DR: RaindropGS是一个用于评估3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在雨滴干扰条件下性能的综合基准，包含真实世界雨滴数据集和完整评估流程，揭示了现有方法在无约束雨滴图像上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准通常使用已知相机姿态的合成雨滴图像评估3DGS，但在真实场景中雨滴会干扰相机姿态估计和点云初始化，且合成与真实雨滴存在显著域差距，影响泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含三个对齐图像集（雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦、无雨地面真值）的真实世界雨滴重建数据集，设计完整评估流程：数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知3DGS评估。

Result: 揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制，以及相机焦点位置、不准确姿态和点云初始化对重建的干扰影响。

Conclusion: 为开发更鲁棒的雨滴条件下3DGS方法提供了明确方向，建立了全面的评估基准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法在多参考视觉地点识别中实现了显著的性能提升，同时保持了轻量级特性，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种高效的视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉令牌和解码阶段检索查询相关令牌来实现加速，在保持准确性的同时获得2.6倍端到端加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的推理可扩展性受到视觉令牌数量增长的限制，这些令牌主导了推理延迟。

Method: 提出SparseVILA，在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉令牌，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关令牌，采用解耦的稀疏设计。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务上实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: 通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，SparseVILA为高效多模态推理提供了无需训练、架构无关的加速框架。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练免费注意力控制方法难以同时实现强编辑能力和源图像一致性，在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积，且全局一致性限制了细粒度编辑能力。

Method: 基于MM-DiT架构分析，提出三种关键洞察：视觉专用注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、查询键值令牌差异化操作，构建ConsistEdit方法。

Result: 在广泛图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，支持结构和非结构一致性场景，首次实现全推理步骤和注意力层编辑，无需手工调整。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit显著提升了编辑的可靠性和一致性，支持鲁棒的多轮和多区域编辑，并能渐进调整结构一致性，提供更精细的控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子自然语言处理在语义建模中的潜力，特别是在资源受限的少样本设置下，通过将组合结构直接嵌入量子电路来实现高效的语义表示。

Method: 使用lambeq库和DisCoCat框架构建参数化量子电路处理句子对，训练语义相关性和推理分类任务，并提出基于聚类的架构来促进参数共享。

Result: 量子模型在参数数量大幅减少的情况下达到与经典基准相当的性能，在推理任务上优于随机初始化的transformer，在相关任务上测试误差更低，且学习效率比经典模型高出最多五个数量级。

Conclusion: 量子自然语言处理在低资源、结构敏感的场景中展现出巨大潜力，其高参数效率为自然语言处理提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Quantum natural language processing (QNLP) offers a novel approach to
semantic modeling by embedding compositional structure directly into quantum
circuits. This paper investigates the application of QNLP models to the task of
Natural Language Inference (NLI), comparing quantum, hybrid, and classical
transformer-based models under a constrained few-shot setting. Using the lambeq
library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits
for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference
classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel
information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which
quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate
that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while
operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models
outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower
test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly
higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more
than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource,
structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote
parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that
improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters
rather than individual tokens.

Abstract: This study presents a novel multi-model fusion framework leveraging two
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT and Claude, to enhance
the reliability of chest X-ray interpretation on the CheXpert dataset. From the
full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234
radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only
prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of
62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a
95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the
impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes
following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly
selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal
cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while
consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions,
agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These
findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and
using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical
utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to
reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead.

Motivation: 虽然已有多种LLM自校正方法，但缺乏全面评估，且LLM能否真正自我校正仍是重要问题。

Method: 开发CorrectBench基准，评估内在、外部和微调三种自校正策略在常识推理、数学推理和代码生成任务上的表现。

Result: 1) 自校正方法能提高准确性，特别是复杂推理任务；2) 混合策略有进一步改进但降低效率；3) 推理LLM在额外自校正下优化有限且时间成本高；4) 简单CoT基线表现竞争力强。

Conclusion: 自校正有潜力提升LLM推理性能，但需平衡推理能力与操作效率，建议进一步研究优化这一平衡。

Abstract: Self-correction of large language models (LLMs) emerges as a critical
component for enhancing their reasoning performance. Although various
self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these
methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly
correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this
study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the
effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and
fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical
reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction
methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing
different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it
reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited
optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs.
Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline
demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the
potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while
highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently,

TL;DR: EvolveR是一个让LLM智能体通过闭环经验生命周期实现自我改进的框架，包含离线自蒸馏和在线交互两个关键阶段，在复杂多跳问答任务中表现优于现有基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体在工具使用方面表现良好，但缺乏从自身经验中系统学习的能力，无法迭代优化问题解决策略，这限制了其自主性和持续改进能力。

Method: 提出EvolveR框架，包含：1）离线自蒸馏阶段：将智能体交互轨迹合成为结构化、可重用的抽象策略原则库；2）在线交互阶段：智能体与任务交互并检索蒸馏原则指导决策，积累多样化行为轨迹；采用策略强化机制迭代更新智能体。

Result: 在复杂多跳问答基准测试中，EvolveR实现了优于现有强基线智能体的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该工作为智能体不仅从外部数据学习，还能从自身行为后果中学习的完整蓝图，为更自主和持续改进的系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Model (LLM) agents show strong performance in tool
use, but lack the crucial capability to systematically learn from their own
experiences. While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external
knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the
inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we
introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through
a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key
stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction
trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable
strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with
tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making,
accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a
policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its
performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop
question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over
strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for
agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of
their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously
improving systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/EvolveR.

*Binglan Han,Anuradha Mathrani,Teo Susnjak*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究量化了提示策略与大语言模型在系统文献综述筛选阶段的交互作用，评估了6个LLM在5种提示类型下的表现，发现CoT-少样本提示提供最可靠的精确率-召回率平衡，并推荐了分阶段工作流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 系统文献综述的筛选阶段耗时且劳动密集，本研究旨在探索LLM如何通过不同的提示策略自动化这一过程，分析模型与提示策略的交互效应。

Method: 评估6个LLM（GPT-4o、GPT-4o-mini、DeepSeek-Chat-V3、Gemini-2.5-Flash、Claude-3.5-Haiku、Llama-4-Maverick）在5种提示类型（零样本、少样本、思维链、思维链-少样本、自我反思）下的表现，使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数作为评估指标。

Result: 结果显示明显的模型-提示交互效应：CoT-少样本提示提供最可靠的精确率-召回率平衡；零样本提示在高敏感度筛选中最大化召回率；自我反思表现不佳。GPT-4o和DeepSeek整体表现稳健，GPT-4o-mini在显著降低成本的同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 推荐分阶段工作流程：首先使用低成本模型配合结构化提示进行初步筛选，仅对边界案例使用高容量模型。研究为任务自适应LLM部署提供了比较基准和实践指导。

Abstract: This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language
models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews
(SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3,
Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types
(zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection)
across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction
effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance;
zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection
underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and
DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs
competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis
for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute
differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across
prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer
attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that
(1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening
and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These
findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature
screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a
comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.

*Tina Behnia,Puneesh Deora,Christos Thrampoulidis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个合成测试平台，用于系统分析语言模型中统计规律性和事实关联之间的交互作用，发现上下文多样性和结构对事实泛化能力的关键影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对语言模型中统计规律性和事实关联交互作用的系统分析，特别是这些交互如何影响泛化能力。

Method: 设计了一个灵活的合成测试平台，将通用标记的统计流与抽象事实的源-目标标记对相结合，能够精细控制它们的交互作用。

Result: 研究发现更高的上下文多样性会延迟域内事实准确性，但对域外事实泛化的影响关键取决于上下文结构。在某些情况下，低多样性会阻碍事实回忆，而最优多样性水平取决于训练时长。

Conclusion: 上下文设计和多样性水平的相互作用以不同方式影响泛化能力，通过模型组件的受控干预发现域外失败源于不同的优化瓶颈，特别是嵌入和反嵌入层的重要性。

Abstract: Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical
regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific
tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of
their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically
determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these
impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a
statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of
source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their
interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by
manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level
by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled
experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays
in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD)
factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some
cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity
becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity
prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration.
Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical
generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade.
This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level
impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of
controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to
distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding
and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects
that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed
for future investigations.

TL;DR: 这是首个关于生成式AI信任与不信任的计算研究，使用2022-2025年Reddit多子版块数据集，结合众包标注和分类模型分析公众态度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI融入日常生活，理解公众信任对负责任采用和治理至关重要，但缺乏大规模、纵向的计算方法来衡量对GenAI和LLMs的信任。

Method: 使用39个子版块的Reddit多年度数据集（197,618条帖子），结合众包标注代表性样本和分类模型进行扩展分析。

Result: 信任与不信任随时间基本平衡，主要模型发布时出现波动；技术性能和可用性是主要维度，个人经验是最常见态度形成原因；不同用户群体（专家、伦理学家、普通用户）呈现不同模式。

Conclusion: 研究提供了大规模信任分析的方法框架，并揭示了公众对生成式AI不断演变的认知，为负责任AI发展提供见解。

Abstract: The rise of generative AI (GenAI) has impacted many aspects of human life. As
these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust
in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior
work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer
interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and
longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large
language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of
Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025)
spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a
representative sample were combined with classification models to scale
analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with
shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability
dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason
shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g.,
experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological
framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public
perceptions of GenAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI领域缺乏中东和非洲地区的多模态文化多样性数据集，特别是针对埃及文化的资源有限。

Method: 设计并运行新的数据收集流程，收集了涵盖地标、食物和民间传说等313个概念的3000多张图像，每个条目都经过人工验证文化真实性和多模态一致性。

Result: 在EgMM-Corpus上评估CLIP模型的零样本性能，Top-1准确率为21.2%，Top-5准确率为36.4%。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了大规模视觉语言模型中存在的文化偏见，并证明了EgMM-Corpus作为开发文化感知模型基准的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in AI, multimodal culturally diverse datasets are
still limited, particularly for regions in the Middle East and Africa. In this
paper, we introduce EgMM-Corpus, a multimodal dataset dedicated to Egyptian
culture. By designing and running a new data collection pipeline, we collected
over 3,000 images, covering 313 concepts across landmarks, food, and folklore.
Each entry in the dataset is manually validated for cultural authenticity and
multimodal coherence. EgMM-Corpus aims to provide a reliable resource for
evaluating and training vision-language models in an Egyptian cultural context.
We further evaluate the zero-shot performance of Contrastive Language-Image
Pre-training CLIP on EgMM-Corpus, on which it achieves 21.2% Top-1 accuracy and
36.4% Top-5 accuracy in classification. These results underscore the existing
cultural bias in large-scale vision-language models and demonstrate the
importance of EgMM-Corpus as a benchmark for developing culturally aware
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文通过理论分析探讨了语言模型是否真正学习到了语法知识，提出了基于最小语义差异对的概率相关性分析方法，并在英语和中文数据上验证了三个关键预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型是否真正掌握了语法知识，因为概率和语法性在语言学中是不同概念，需要澄清字符串概率能否反映模型的语法知识。

Method: 基于语料库生成过程的简单假设，构建理论分析框架，使用280K个英语和中文句子对进行实证验证，重点关注最小语义差异对中的概率相关性。

Result: 验证了三个预测：(1)最小对中字符串概率的相关性；(2)模型与人类在最小对中差异的相关性；(3)语法和不合语法字符串在概率空间中难以区分。

Conclusion: 为使用概率来研究语言模型的结构知识提供了理论基础，并指出了未来语言模型语法评估的研究方向。

Abstract: What have language models (LMs) learned about grammar? This question remains
hotly debated, with major ramifications for linguistic theory. However, since
probability and grammaticality are distinct notions in linguistics, it is not
obvious what string probabilities can reveal about an LM's underlying
grammatical knowledge. We present a theoretical analysis of the relationship
between grammar, meaning, and string probability, based on simple assumptions
about the generative process of corpus data. Our framework makes three
predictions, which we validate empirically using 280K sentence pairs in English
and Chinese: (1) correlation between the probability of strings within minimal
pairs, i.e., string pairs with minimal semantic differences; (2) correlation
between models' and humans' deltas within minimal pairs; and (3) poor
separation in probability space between unpaired grammatical and ungrammatical
strings. Our analyses give theoretical grounding for using probability to learn
about LMs' structural knowledge, and suggest directions for future work in LM
grammatical evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了两种低资源设置下的方法（多元化解码和模型引导）来增强语言模型的多元对齐能力，仅用50个标注样本就能在多个高风险任务中提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型训练范式假设每个查询只有一个最优答案，导致响应泛化且对齐效果差。需要确保模型能够反映多样化的人类价值观和细微差别。

Method: 使用多元化解码和模型引导两种方法，在低资源设置下（仅50个标注样本）增强语言模型的多元对齐能力。

Result: 模型引导方法在零样本和少样本基线上表现一致提升，在仇恨言论检测和错误信息检测等高风险任务中降低了假阳性，在GlobalOpinionQA中改善了与人类价值观的分布对齐。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了多样性的重要性，展示了语言模型如何适应考虑细微视角，为低资源环境下的多元对齐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As language models have a greater impact on society, it is important to
ensure they are aligned to a diverse range of perspectives and are able to
reflect nuance in human values. However, the most popular training paradigms
for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every
query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to
enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with
two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically
demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot
and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods
decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech
detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional
alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA. We hope our work highlights the
importance of diversity and how language models can be adapted to consider
nuanced perspectives.

TL;DR: 提出Profile-to-PEFT框架，使用超网络将用户配置文件直接映射到适配器参数，无需为每个用户单独训练，实现实时个性化LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法需要为每个用户训练单独的适配器，计算成本高且无法实时更新，限制了大规模应用。

Method: 采用端到端训练的超网络，将编码后的用户配置文件直接映射到完整的适配器参数集（如LoRA），部署时无需进行用户特定训练。

Result: 实验表明该方法在部署时使用更少计算资源的同时，性能优于基于提示的个性化和OPPU方法，对分布外用户具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Profile-to-PEFT框架实现了高效、可扩展和自适应的LLM个性化，适合大规模应用场景。

Abstract: Personalized large language models (LLMs) tailor content to individual
preferences using user profiles or histories. However, existing
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the
``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for
each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time
updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a
hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a
full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at
deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen
users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and
OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The
framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and
maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different
embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient,
scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale
applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在训练后增强能力的同时，是否真正意识到自己学到和思考的内容，这关系到模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 通过定义三个核心能力，在多个需要学习不同策略的任务上实证评估，并对比SFT、DPO和GRPO三种训练方法的模型表现。

Result: RL训练的模型比SFT模型表现出更强的学习行为认知能力和泛化能力，但在推理过程与最终输出的对齐方面较弱，GRPO训练的模型这种不对齐效应最明显。

Conclusion: 强化学习训练的模型虽然在学习认知和泛化方面表现更好，但存在推理过程与输出不一致的问题，这为模型可解释性研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Recent advances in post-training techniques have endowed Large Language
Models (LLMs) with enhanced capabilities for tackling complex, logic-intensive
tasks through the generation of supplementary planning tokens. This development
raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they "learn" and
"think"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of
learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains,
and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We
empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require
learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models
post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization
(DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate
that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned
behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks
than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning
traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.

Motivation: 在社交媒体影响公共卫生的时代，打击疫苗怀疑论和错误信息成为关键社会目标。虽然错误信息检测已有进展，但生成针对性的实时反驳论点仍是一个研究不足的领域。

Method: 基于先前错误信息反驳研究，实验了多种提示策略和微调方法优化反驳论点生成，并训练分类器将反疫苗推文分类为疫苗效力、副作用、政治影响等多标签类别，实现更情境感知的反驳。

Result: 通过人工判断、LLM评估和自动指标的评估显示，这些方法具有很强的一致性。整合标签描述和结构化微调能够增强反驳论点的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模缓解疫苗错误信息提供了一个有前景的途径，证明了整合标签描述和结构化微调能够有效提升反驳论点的质量。

Abstract: In an era where public health is increasingly influenced by information
shared on social media, combatting vaccine skepticism and misinformation has
become a critical societal goal. Misleading narratives around vaccination have
spread widely, creating barriers to achieving high immunisation rates and
undermining trust in health recommendations. While efforts to detect
misinformation have made significant progress, the generation of real time
counter-arguments tailored to debunk such claims remains an insufficiently
explored area. In this work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to generate
sound counter-argument rebuttals to vaccine misinformation. Building on prior
research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting
strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.
Additionally, we train classifiers to categorise anti-vaccine tweets into
multi-labeled categories such as concerns about vaccine efficacy, side effects,
and political influences allowing for more context aware rebuttals. Our
evaluation, conducted through human judgment, LLM based assessments, and
automatic metrics, reveals strong alignment across these methods. Our findings
demonstrate that integrating label descriptions and structured fine-tuning
enhances counter-argument effectiveness, offering a promising approach for
mitigating vaccine misinformation at scale.

Motivation: 现有方法通常通过生成范式扁平化论证结构，难以有效建模论证组件和论证关系之间的依赖关系。

Method: 使用自回归论证结构预测框架，将论证结构建模为预定义的约束动作集，通过条件预训练语言模型逐步构建论证结构。

Result: 在三个标准AM基准测试中，AASP在两个基准上实现了所有AM任务的最先进结果，在一个基准上取得了强劲结果。

Conclusion: AASP框架能够有效捕捉论证推理流程，在论证挖掘任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Argument Mining (AM) helps in automating the extraction of complex
argumentative structures such as Argument Components (ACs) like Premise, Claim
etc. and Argumentative Relations (ARs) like Support, Attack etc. in an
argumentative text. Due to the inherent complexity of reasoning involved with
this task, modelling dependencies between ACs and ARs is challenging. Most of
the recent approaches formulate this task through a generative paradigm by
flattening the argumentative structures. In contrast to that, this study
jointly formulates the key tasks of AM in an end-to-end fashion using
Autoregressive Argumentative Structure Prediction (AASP) framework. The
proposed AASP framework is based on the autoregressive structure prediction
framework that has given good performance for several NLP tasks. AASP framework
models the argumentative structures as constrained pre-defined sets of actions
with the help of a conditional pre-trained language model. These actions build
the argumentative structures step-by-step in an autoregressive manner to
capture the flow of argumentative reasoning in an efficient way. Extensive
experiments conducted on three standard AM benchmarks demonstrate that AASP
achieves state-of-theart (SoTA) results across all AM tasks in two benchmarks
and delivers strong results in one benchmark.

Result: 该方法在两个任务上取得改进：识别Reddit帖子是否有助于检测抑郁症状的相关性预测，以及基于用户Reddit历史完成标准化抑郁筛查问卷

Conclusion: 引导机制作为计算效率高的工具，在LLMs心理健康领域适应方面具有未开发的潜力

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming AI,
opening new opportunities in sensitive and high-impact areas such as Mental
Health (MH). Yet, despite these advancements, recent evidence reveals that
smaller-scale models still struggle to deliver optimal performance in
domain-specific applications. In this study, we present a cost-efficient yet
powerful approach to improve MH assessment capabilities of an LLM, without
relying on any computationally intensive techniques. Our lightweight method
consists of a linear transformation applied to a specific layer's activations,
leveraging steering vectors to guide the model's output. Remarkably, this
intervention enables the model to achieve improved results across two distinct
tasks: (1) identifying whether a Reddit post is useful for detecting the
presence or absence of depressive symptoms (relevance prediction task), and (2)
completing a standardized psychological screening questionnaire for depression
based on users' Reddit post history (questionnaire completion task). Results
highlight the untapped potential of steering mechanisms as computationally
efficient tools for LLMs' MH domain adaptation.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在决策中扮演更重要角色，需要理解AI如何做出决策而不仅仅是决策结果。道德困境是评估AI推理过程的理想测试平台，因为存在多个合理的结论。

Method: 创建MoReBench数据集：1000个道德场景，每个场景配有专家制定的评估标准，包括识别道德考量、权衡利弊、给出可行建议等。另创建MoReBench-Theory测试AI在五种规范伦理学框架下的推理能力。

Result: 扩展定律和现有数学、代码、科学推理基准无法预测模型的道德推理能力。模型对特定道德框架（如边沁功利主义和康德义务论）表现出偏好，这可能是流行训练范式的副作用。

Conclusion: MoReBench基准推动了以过程为重点的推理评估，有助于开发更安全、更透明的AI系统。

Abstract: As AI systems progress, we rely more on them to make decisions with us and
for us. To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is
imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how
they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both
final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces,
present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and
code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are
an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for
multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral
scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider
essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench
contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations,
weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI
advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously.
Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can
reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that
scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning
tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also
show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act
Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular
training paradigms. Together, these benchmarks advance process-focused
reasoning evaluation towards safer and more transparent AI.

Method: 采用神经符号方法，将任务分为两个阶段：离线阶段将非正式问题规范转换为形式化知识库，在线阶段使用符号决策引擎基于形式化输入和知识库生成可靠结果。

Result: 在复杂推理任务上的评估显示，ATA在完全自动化设置下与最先进的端到端推理模型竞争，同时保持可信度。使用人工验证的知识库时，ATA显著优于更大的模型，具有完美确定性、增强的稳定性以及对提示注入攻击的固有免疫性。

Conclusion: ATA通过基于符号推理的决策生成，为构建下一代透明、可审计和可靠的自主体提供了一个实用且可控的架构。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in
trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of
transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic
neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The
core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline
knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an
LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic
knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and
refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain
requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is
encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes
this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a
reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task,
we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with
state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while
maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected
knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models,
while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input
perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating
decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and
controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent,
auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探索Whisper语音识别模型在L2口语评估中的潜力，通过提取隐藏表示中的声学和语言特征，仅需训练轻量级分类器即可超越现有先进基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挖掘Whisper模型在L2口语评估中的潜在能力，不同于以往仅分析其转录文本的方法，本研究深入探索其隐藏表示的特征提取能力。

Method: 从Whisper的中间和最终输出中提取声学和语言特征，仅训练轻量级分类器，并融入图像和文本提示信息作为辅助相关性线索。

Result: 在GEPT图片描述数据集上表现优异，超越现有先进基线方法（包括多模态方法），通过融入额外信息获得进一步性能提升。

Conclusion: Whisper模型即使没有任务特定微调，也能内在编码口语的序数熟练度模式和语义方面，显示出其作为口语评估和理解的强大基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a
well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the
context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that
extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a
step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and
linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight
classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs,
our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset,
outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach.
Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary
relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even
without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal
proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential
as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

### [200] [FrugalPrompt: Reducing Contextual Overhead in Large Language Models via Token Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16439)
*Syed Rifat Raiyan,Md Farhan Ishmam,Abdullah Al Imran,Mohammad Ali Moni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FrugalPrompt是一个新颖的LLM提示压缩框架，通过保留最具语义重要性的token来减少输入长度，在多个NLP任务中实现20%压缩率时性能损失很小，但在数学推理任务中性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的冗长输入会增加成本、碳足迹和推理延迟，而典型提示中存在大量冗余的低效用token，只有少数token承载主要语义权重。

Method: 使用GlobEnc和DecompX两种token归因方法为输入序列中的每个token分配显著性分数，按分数排序并保留前k%的token，保持原始顺序获得稀疏的压缩提示。

Result: 在情感分析、常识问答和摘要任务中，20%的提示压缩仅导致轻微性能损失，表明LLM可以从高显著性线索重建省略的上下文；但在数学推理中性能急剧恶化，反映对完整token连续性的更强依赖。

Conclusion: 该工作有助于更细致地理解LLM在性能-效率权衡中的行为，并界定了对上下文稀疏性容忍的任务与需要详尽上下文的任务之间的边界。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to
expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon
footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the
redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of
tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this
inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework
for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens.
Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX,
we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to
preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse
frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment
Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a
suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction
incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that
contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In
contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply,
reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis
with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns
that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may
resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional
NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding
of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the
boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring
exhaustive context. Our source code and models are available at:

TL;DR: TrajSelector是一个高效的Best-of-N框架，利用LLM的隐藏状态进行过程级评分，通过轻量级验证器评估推理轨迹质量，在保持较低推理成本的同时显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的外部TTS方法存在计算开销大和未充分利用LLM内在潜表示的问题，需要更高效的Best-of-N选择框架。

Method: 使用仅0.6B参数的轻量级验证器，基于LLM隐藏状态对推理轨迹进行逐步评分，采用端到端数据驱动训练，无需大量步骤级标注。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，TrajSelector在Best-of-32设置下比多数投票准确率高4.61%，比现有过程奖励模型高4.31%-12.21%，且推理成本更低。

Conclusion: TrajSelector通过有效利用LLM的潜表示，提供了一个计算效率高且性能优异的Best-of-N推理轨迹选择框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in complex
reasoning tasks, largely enabled by test-time scaling (TTS) paradigms that
allocate additional compute during inference. Among these, external TTS
(particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance
improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning
trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high
computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the
underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce
TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the
hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight
verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise
trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning
trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training
recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential
results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers
consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority
voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by
4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.

TL;DR: RAVEN是一个结合课程强化学习和多模态大语言模型的广告视频违规检测框架，通过渐进式训练策略和GRPO优化方法提升推理能力，在工业数据集上实现了优异的违规类别准确性和时间定位性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有广告视频违规检测方法在精确时间定位、噪声标注和泛化能力方面存在不足，需要开发更有效的检测框架。

Method: 集成课程强化学习与多模态大语言模型，采用渐进式训练策略结合精确和粗略标注数据，使用GRPO开发推理能力，设计多层次奖励机制确保时间定位和类别预测一致性。

Result: 在工业数据集和公共基准测试中，RAVEN在违规类别准确性和时间间隔定位方面表现优异，在线A/B测试验证了其实际应用价值，精度和召回率显著提升。

Conclusion: RAVEN框架有效解决了广告视频违规检测中的关键挑战，展示了强大的泛化能力，缓解了监督微调带来的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Advertisement (Ad) video violation detection is critical for ensuring
platform compliance, but existing methods struggle with precise temporal
grounding, noisy annotations, and limited generalization. We propose RAVEN, a
novel framework that integrates curriculum reinforcement learning with
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enhance reasoning and cognitive
capabilities for violation detection. RAVEN employs a progressive training
strategy, combining precisely and coarsely annotated data, and leverages Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to develop emergent reasoning abilities
without explicit reasoning annotations. Multiple hierarchical sophisticated
reward mechanism ensures precise temporal grounding and consistent category
prediction. Experiments on industrial datasets and public benchmarks show that
RAVEN achieves superior performances in violation category accuracy and
temporal interval localization. We also design a pipeline to deploy the RAVEN
on the online Ad services, and online A/B testing further validates its
practical applicability, with significant improvements in precision and recall.
RAVEN also demonstrates strong generalization, mitigating the catastrophic
forgetting issue associated with supervised fine-tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文扩展了LiTEx分类法在自然语言推理中的应用，不仅分析标注者推理类型的差异，还考察标签选择的分歧，发现表面标签不一致可能掩盖深层的解释一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注标注者在相同标签下的解释差异，而本文旨在更全面地分析标注者分歧，包括标签选择和推理过程的差异，以揭示自然语言推理中人类标注变异的复杂性。

Method: 将LiTEx分类法应用于两个英文NLI数据集，从多个维度对齐标注变异：NLI标签一致性、解释相似性和分类法一致性，并考虑标注者选择偏好的复合因素。

Result: 发现标注者可能标签不一致但解释高度相似的情况，表明表面分歧可能掩盖深层解释一致性；同时揭示了标注者在解释策略和标签选择上的个体偏好。

Conclusion: 推理类型的一致性比标签一致性更能反映自由文本解释的语义相似性，强调了基于推理的解释的丰富性，以及将标签视为绝对真实时需要谨慎对待。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference datasets often exhibit human label variation. To
better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the
underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the
LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into
reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on
within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but
provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by
examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in
the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning
process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We
apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from
multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy
agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias.
We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly
similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask
underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals
individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These
findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the
semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our
findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need
for caution in treating labels as ground truth.

TL;DR: 提出使用"退出"作为LLM代理的安全机制，让代理在缺乏信心时主动退出，在ToolEmu框架下评估12个先进LLM，结果显示退出指令显著提升安全性且几乎不影响帮助性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在复杂环境中运行并产生现实后果，其安全性变得至关重要。多轮代理场景中的不确定性和模糊性会累积，导致超出传统文本生成失败的严重风险。

Method: 利用ToolEmu框架系统评估12个最先进LLM的退出行为，通过添加明确的退出指令来测试代理的安全性和帮助性权衡。

Result: 退出指令使所有模型的安全性平均提升+0.39（0-3分制），专有模型提升+0.64，而帮助性仅平均下降-0.03，显示出极佳的安全-帮助性权衡。

Conclusion: 简单添加明确的退出指令是一种高度有效的安全机制，可立即部署到现有代理系统中，作为高风险应用中自主代理的有效第一道防线。

Abstract: As Large Language Model (LLM) agents increasingly operate in complex
environments with real-world consequences, their safety becomes critical. While
uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn
agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where
uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks
beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using "quitting" as a
simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and
withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu
framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12
state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable
safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit
instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all
models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average
decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding
explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism
that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes
quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in
high-stakes applications.

Motivation: 现有智能体系统组件选择和组合方法存在局限性，主要依赖静态语义检索，无法综合考虑能力、成本和实时效用，导致组件复用和组合效率低下

Method: 引入结构化自动化框架，受背包问题启发，通过动态测试候选组件并实时建模其效用，系统性地识别、选择和组装最优的智能体组件集合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实证评估显示，基于在线背包问题的组合器始终位于帕累托前沿，在单智能体设置中成功率提升高达31.6%，在多智能体系统中成功率从37%提升至87%

Conclusion: 该方法在多样化领域和预算约束下展现出强大的适应性，显著提高了智能体系统的性能和资源利用效率

Abstract: Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and
integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain
environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval
approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and
composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete
capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component
selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and
real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured,
automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the
knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically
identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly
considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically
testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our
approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable
reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five
benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer
consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at
significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the
single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate
improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In
multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from
37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The
substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method
across diverse domains and budget constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审作为科学的守门人面临挑战：提交量激增和LLM在学术评估中的广泛使用，导致有缺陷的评审（来自人类专家和AI系统）可能系统性地破坏同行评审生态系统和学术诚信。

Method: 四阶段LLM驱动框架：1)从OpenReview收集ICLR和NeurIPS论文及评审；2)使用GPT-4.1标注评审类型并人工验证；3)通过LLM驱动的合成数据增强解决类别不平衡和数据稀缺问题；4)微调编码器模型和开源LLM。

Result: 构建了包含6,634篇论文、24,657条真实评审和46,438条合成评审的语料库。有缺陷评审显示更低的评分、更高的自报告信心、更低的结构复杂度和更高比例的负面情绪。AI生成检测显示ChatGPT出现后AI生成评审大幅增加。

Conclusion: 这是首个用于检测有缺陷同行评审的LLM驱动系统，为同行评审中的AI治理提供证据，并为维护学术诚信的人机协作提供宝贵见解。

Abstract: Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions
and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation
present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to
improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However,
unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to
systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic
integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an
automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard
employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR
and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2)
annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class
imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation,
producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438
synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source
LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of
the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate
lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural
complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text
detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have
increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models,
mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial
enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents
the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing
evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable
insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析LLMs在回答文化相关问题时内部激活路径的重叠程度，研究了语言模型的文化理解机制，发现语言特异性比文化因素对内部表征的影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多元文化环境中的应用日益广泛，准确的文化理解变得至关重要。现有评估多关注输出层面性能，难以揭示响应差异的驱动因素，而电路分析研究覆盖语言少且很少聚焦文化。

Method: 通过测量LLMs在回答语义等效问题时内部激活路径的重叠程度，比较两种条件：(1)改变目标国家但固定问题语言；(2)改变问题语言但固定国家。同时使用同语言国家对来区分语言和文化因素。

Result: 结果显示，同语言跨国家问题的内部路径重叠度高于跨语言同国家问题，表明存在强烈的语言特定模式。特别地，韩国-朝鲜对显示出低重叠度和高变异性，说明语言相似性不能保证内部表征的一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs的文化理解机制受语言特异性影响强于文化因素，语言相似性不足以确保内部表征的一致性，这对跨文化应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural
contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations
have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that
drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have
covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace
LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path
overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions:
varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the
question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country
pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal
paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for
cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific
patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and
high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned
internal representation.

TL;DR: SHALLOW是首个系统性地从词汇、语音、形态和语义四个维度分类和量化ASR系统幻觉现象的基准框架，能够捕捉WER无法区分的细粒度错误模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统中的幻觉会产生与语音信号完全无关但语法语义合理的转录，这在医疗和法律等关键领域带来严重风险。传统评估指标无法区分语音不准确性和幻觉现象。

Method: 提出SHALLOW基准框架，从四个互补维度（词汇、语音、形态、语义）系统分类幻觉现象，并为每个类别定义针对性指标来生成可解释的模型行为分析。

Result: SHALLOW指标在识别质量高时与WER强相关，但随着WER增加相关性显著减弱。SHALLOW能够捕捉在降级和挑战性条件下WER无法区分的细粒度错误模式。

Conclusion: SHALLOW框架支持对模型弱点的具体诊断，并提供超越聚合错误率的模型改进反馈，为ASR系统幻觉评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent
and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely
unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While
similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the
usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be
more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically
plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing
stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as
healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on
error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and
hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation
frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened
propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce
SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and
quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes:
lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics
within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior.
Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have
found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when
recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens
substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error
patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging
conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and
provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can
offer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语等低资源语言缺乏AI生成文本检测工具，随着LLM生成文本能力的增强，区分人类写作和机器生成文本变得困难，这给打击错误信息和学术不端带来了挑战。

Method: 构建了包含1800篇人类写作和1800篇AI生成文本的平衡数据集，进行语言学和统计分析，使用字符数、词汇丰富度、N-gram模式等特征，并微调了mdeberta-v3-base、distilbert-base-multilingualcased和xlm-roberta-base三个多语言transformer模型。

Result: mDeBERTa-v3-base模型表现最佳，在测试集上F1分数达到91.29，准确率为91.26%。

Conclusion: 该研究推进了乌尔都语社区对抗错误信息和学术不端的努力，并为低资源语言的NLP工具开发做出了贡献。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are now capable of generating text that closely
resembles human writing, making them powerful tools for content creation, but
this growing ability has also made it harder to tell whether a piece of text
was written by a human or by a machine. This challenge becomes even more
serious for languages like Urdu, where there are very few tools available to
detect AI-generated text. To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated
text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset
comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from
models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed
linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as
character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram
patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests.
Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as
mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were
fine-tuned on this dataset. The mDeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest
performance, with an F1-score 91.29 and accuracy of 91.26% on the test set.
This research advances efforts in contesting misinformation and academic
misconduct in Urdu-speaking communities and contributes to the broader
development of NLP tools for low resource languages.

### [211] [Unleashing Diverse Thinking Modes in LLMs through Multi-Agent Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16645)
*Zhixuan He,Yue Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DiMo框架通过四个专门化LLM代理模拟结构化辩论，提升大语言模型的性能和可解释性，在六个基准测试中表现优于单模型和辩论基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能强大但缺乏可解释的推理过程，需要一种能同时提升性能和解释性的方法。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，四个专门化代理代表不同的推理范式，通过迭代式辩论来挑战和完善初始响应。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DiMo框架的准确率超过了广泛使用的单模型和辩论基线，在数学问题上提升最大。

Conclusion: DiMo是一个语义感知的Web原生多智能体框架，能够生成语义类型化、URL注释的证据链，为下游系统提供可检查和重用的结构化论证。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack
interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration
Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance
and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized
LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the
framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through
iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more
robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six
benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over
widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math.
We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it
models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically
typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly
interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the
framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs,
combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that
downstream systems can inspect and reuse.

*Yiyang Liu,James C. Liang,Heng Fan,Wenhao Yang,Yiming Cui,Xiaotian Han,Lifu Huang,Dongfang Liu,Qifan Wang,Cheng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，通过将实例感知信息整合到提示学习中，解决了传统提示学习方法依赖网格搜索、缺乏实例感知信息的问题，实现了参数高效且性能优越的模型调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于提示的学习方法存在两个主要问题：1）严重依赖网格搜索来确定最优提示长度，计算负担重；2）缺乏实例感知信息，导致与输入序列的注意力交互受限。研究发现，简单地加入实例感知信息就能提升模型性能，而无需额外微调。

Method: 提出了Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT)方法，创新性地将实例感知和任务感知信息集成到单个胶囊提示中，采用近乎参数免费的方式。该方法利用现成的、信息丰富的实例语义，将实例感知标记置于序列最前位置作为"注意力锚点"。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多种语言任务上表现出优越性能（如在T5-Large上达到84.03%的平均准确率），同时保持高参数效率（如在Llama3.2-1B上仅使用模型参数的0.003%）。

Conclusion: CaPT方法通过引入实例感知信息作为注意力锚点，有效提升了提示学习的性能，同时保持了极高的参数效率，为大型语言模型的高效调优提供了新思路。

Abstract: Prompt-based learning has emerged as a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT)
approach to facilitate Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation to downstream
tasks by conditioning generation with task-aware guidance. Despite its
successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid
searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number
of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer
findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by
its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention
interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating
instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the
prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we
find an interesting phenomenon, namely "attention anchor", that incorporating
instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully
preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more
active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our
observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and
effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics
into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both
instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner
(i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our
method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g.,
84.03\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an "attention anchor," while
enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\% of model parameters on
Llama3.2-1B).

### [213] [Temporal Understanding under Deictic Frame of Reference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16685)
*Damin Zhang,Julia Rayz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了TUuD框架评估大语言模型在动态时间参考点下的时间理解能力，发现LLMs能部分适应人类的时间认知模式，但时间推理能力仍受参考框架变化和时间距离影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过空间隐喻理解时间，使用时间参考框架(t-FoR)来感知时间关系。虽然LLMs在自然语言理解方面取得显著进展，但其时间理解和推理能力仍然有限，需要评估LLMs如何解释动态变化的时间参考点。

Method: 引入TUuD框架，让LLMs从0.00到1.00评分当前时刻与目标事件之间的相似度，量化两个时间点之间的感知时间对齐程度，评估LLMs在动态变化的时间参考点下的表现。

Result: 四个评估的LLMs显示出对时间参考框架的可测量适应，相似度评分在当前时刻附近达到峰值，并向过去和未来事件递减。但这种适应在超出近期语境时会减弱。

Conclusion: LLMs表现出部分类似人类的时间认知，但其时间推理对参考框架变化和时间距离仍然敏感，表明其时间理解能力仍有限制。

Abstract: Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal
experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in
sensory-motor experience. For example, "summer is approaching" parallels "We
are approaching the summer". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of
reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint.
Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines
how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of
"now". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in
natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about
time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding
under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event
and event-event relations when the reference point of "now" dynamically shifts
along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition
\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the
current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00
(highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment
between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit
measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking
around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The
adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while
LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning
remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了思维链（CoT）推理在自然语言理解（NLU）任务中的应用，发现随着模型规模增大，CoT推理从阻碍NLU性能转变为超越直接标签预测，并开发了专门设计的训练方法实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注思维链在推理任务中的作用，忽视了其在自然语言理解任务中的潜在价值，本文旨在系统探索理性在NLU任务中的适用性。

Method: 构建了NLURC数据集，开发了多种理性增强方法，并系统探索这些方法在NLU任务中的应用效果。

Result: 发现模型规模与CoT推理效果呈正相关；大多数理性增强训练方法表现不如仅标签训练，但有一种专门设计的方法能持续改进性能；使用理性训练的LLM在未见NLU任务上表现显著提升，性能可与大十倍模型相媲美。

Conclusion: 理性在NLU任务中具有重要价值，特别是在模型规模较大时，通过专门设计的训练方法可以显著提升模型性能和在未见任务上的泛化能力。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, which provide step-by-step reasoning to
derive final answers, benefit LLMs in both inference and training.
Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during
inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during
training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic
and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of
rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on
other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this
work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To
conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and
high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various
rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these
methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially
surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to
surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive
correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than
label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving
improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance
gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while
delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent in modern society
and has a significant effect on global health and well-being. Heart-related
conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a
combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various
socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially
complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data,
which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature,
among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly
been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount
of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain
deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to
revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of
cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in
cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find
articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range
of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process,
we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from
multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types,
cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals
considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the
considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a
temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP
methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the
review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in
cardiology to date.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become
ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines
their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of "chameleon
behavior" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with
contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in
search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising
17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn
conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in
state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the
Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use
Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of
Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent
failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511),
with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small
across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a
sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations
between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes
(r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that
limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query
framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency
evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems
where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for
reliable decision support.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了诗歌中空白的分布特征，比较了人类创作诗歌与LLM生成诗歌在空白使用上的差异，并探讨了文本处理方法对空白表示的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空白是诗歌形式的关键组成部分，反映了诗人对标准化形式的遵循与反叛。尽管诗歌是长期存在的艺术形式，也是LLM的生成任务，但空白在NLP社区中未得到足够关注。

Method: 使用来自Poetry Foundation的19k英文诗歌语料库，分析了4k诗人如何使用空白。比较了已发表诗歌与LLM生成诗歌、未发表诗歌的空白使用，并探索了不同时期、诗歌形式和数据源中的空白使用模式。

Result: 发现不同的文本处理方法会导致诗歌数据中空白表示的显著差异。发布了2.8k公共领域诗歌子集以促进该领域进一步研究。

Conclusion: 研究结果对LLM预训练数据集的处理策略具有重要启示，强调了在诗歌处理中保留空白特征的重要性。

Abstract: Whitespace is a critical component of poetic form, reflecting both adherence
to standardized forms and rebellion against those forms. Each poem's whitespace
distribution reflects the artistic choices of the poet and is an integral
semantic and spatial feature of the poem. Yet, despite the popularity of poetry
as both a long-standing art form and as a generation task for large language
models (LLMs), whitespace has not received sufficient attention from the NLP
community. Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry
Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We
release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to
facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the
published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems
posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time
periods, poetic forms, and data sources. Additionally, we find that different
text processing methods can result in significantly different representations
of whitespace in poetry data, motivating us to use these poems and whitespace
patterns to discuss implications for the processing strategies used to assemble
pretraining datasets for LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Beacon基准来测量大语言模型中的谄媚偏见（sycophancy），即模型倾向于讨好用户而非坚持事实的倾向，并揭示了这种偏见随模型能力增强而加剧的现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在奖励优化过程中混淆了帮助性和礼貌服从，形成了事实性和谄媚之间的结构性权衡，这种偏见会影响模型的推理原则性。

Method: 引入Beacon基准，通过单轮强制选择任务独立于对话上下文来隔离谄媚偏见，并提出了提示级和激活级的干预方法来调节这种偏见。

Result: 对12个最先进模型的评估显示，谄媚偏见可分解为稳定的语言和情感子偏见，且随模型容量增加而增强；干预方法能够在事实性和社会合规判断之间调节偏见。

Conclusion: Beacon将谄媚重新定义为一种可测量的规范性错误泛化，为研究和缓解大规模生成系统中的对齐漂移提供了可复现的基础。

Abstract: Large language models internalize a structural trade-off between truthfulness
and obsequious flattery, emerging from reward optimization that conflates
helpfulness with polite submission. This latent bias, known as sycophancy,
manifests as a preference for user agreement over principled reasoning. We
introduce Beacon, a single-turn forced-choice benchmark that isolates this bias
independent of conversational context, enabling precise measurement of the
tension between factual accuracy and submissive bias. Evaluations across twelve
state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable
linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We
further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate
these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of
alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant
judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative
misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and
mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.

Motivation: 现有语言智能体在动态对抗游戏中策略推理能力不足，需要无需专家标注数据的自动学习方法，而对手选择对学习性能有重要影响但研究不足。

Method: 提出SCO-PAL（Step-level poliCy Optimization through Play-And-Learn）方法，通过设置不同水平的对手进行分析，发现自博弈是最有效的学习方式。

Result: 使用SCO-PAL与自博弈，相比基线在四个对手上的平均胜率提升约30%，在六个对抗游戏中对抗GPT-4的胜率达到54.76%。

Conclusion: 自博弈是提升对抗环境中策略推理的最有效方式，SCO-PAL方法显著提高了语言智能体的游戏表现。

Abstract: Existing language agents often encounter difficulties in dynamic adversarial
games due to poor strategic reasoning. To mitigate this limitation, a promising
approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically,
without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where
agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in
dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance.
However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an
area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy
Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we
conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at
different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve
strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with
self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by
approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against
GPT-4 in six adversarial games.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
sophisticated capabilities, including the ability to process and comprehend
extended contexts. These emergent capabilities necessitate rigorous evaluation
methods to effectively assess their performance in long-context understanding.
In this paper, we present \textbf{LC-Eval}, a bilingual, multi-task evaluation
benchmark designed to evaluate long-context understanding in English and
Arabic, targeting context lengths ranging from 4k to over 128k tokens. LC-Eval
introduces four novel and challenging tasks: multi-document question answering,
bilingual question answering, claim verification within a paragraph, and
multiple-choice questions based on long contexts. These tasks are designed to
assess LLMs' abilities in deep reasoning, document comprehension, information
tracing, and bilingual information extraction and understanding. The benchmark
includes datasets in both Arabic and English for each task, allowing for a
comparative analysis of their performance across different text genres.
Evaluations were conducted on both open-weight and closed LLMs, with results
indicating that LC-Eval presents significant challenges. Even high-performing
models, such as GPT-4o, struggled with certain tasks, highlighting the
complexity and rigor of the benchmark.

Result: 在高资源和低资源领域均取得显著提升，NDCG@10指标相比强通用领域基线最高提升13.4%。

Conclusion: 联合监督和分阶段适应对领域自适应至关重要，MOSAIC框架能有效提升句子嵌入模型在专业领域的性能。

Abstract: We introduce MOSAIC (Masked Objective with Selective Adaptation for In-domain
Contrastive learning), a multi-stage framework for domain adaptation of
sentence embedding models that incorporates joint domain-specific masked
supervision. Our approach addresses the challenges of adapting large-scale
general-domain sentence embedding models to specialized domains. By jointly
optimizing masked language modeling (MLM) and contrastive objectives within a
unified training pipeline, our method enables effective learning of
domain-relevant representations while preserving the robust semantic
discrimination properties of the original model. We empirically validate our
approach on both high-resource and low-resource domains, achieving improvements
up to 13.4% in NDCG@10 (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain) over strong
general-domain baselines. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate
the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the importance of balanced
joint supervision and staged adaptation.

Motivation: 理解LLMs何时依赖真实知识而非表面启发式进行基于知识的推理任务，通过实体比较任务来系统分析模型的行为模式。

Method: 使用实体比较任务（如比较河流长度），分析LLMs在拥有足够数值知识的情况下为何做出错误预测，识别三种启发式偏差的影响，并测试不同规模模型的表现差异。

Result: 小模型（7-8B参数）的预测更多受启发式偏差影响，而大模型（32B参数）能选择性使用更可靠的数值知识，思维链提示能改善所有模型对数值特征的使用。

Conclusion: 模型规模影响知识使用策略，大模型能更好地区分何时依赖知识而非启发式，思维链提示是改善模型推理的有效方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for knowledge-based
reasoning tasks, yet understanding when they rely on genuine knowledge versus
superficial heuristics remains challenging. We investigate this question
through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along
numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the
Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite
having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make
predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases
that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order,
and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression
using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the
model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override
principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters)
selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller
models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why
larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more
accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using
the numerical features across all model sizes.

Result: 在HIATUS的HRS1和HRS2跨体裁AA基准上，分别比之前最佳方法提升22.3和34.4个绝对Success@8点

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了跨体裁作者归属任务，证明了检索-重排策略在AA任务中的有效性，特别是通过针对性训练策略克服了IR方法的不适用性

Abstract: Authorship attribution (AA) is the task of identifying the most likely author
of a query document from a predefined set of candidate authors. We introduce a
two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA.
Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a
de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues
and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are
independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently,
for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR
are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal
behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that
enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using
our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of
22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on
HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.

Method: 基于角色理论和在线OUD康复社区帖子，构建提问者角色分类（患者、照顾者、从业者），并模拟15,321个嵌入各角色目标、行为和经验的提问。

Result: 模拟问题高度可信且与现实数据相当。评估五个LLM发现：相同问题但不同角色会引发系统性差异 - 脆弱角色（患者、照顾者）比从业者获得更多支持性回应（+17%）和更少知识内容（-19%）。

Conclusion: 用户角色的隐式信号会塑造模型回应，本研究提供了基于角色的对话AI评估方法，强调了角色感知评估的重要性。

Abstract: Language model users often embed personal and social context in their
questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed --
creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations,
while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking.
This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use
disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide
accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for
User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based
questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery
community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles --
patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321
questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our
evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable
to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but
differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as
patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced
knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates
how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a
methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成专业金融报告是一个劳动密集且智力要求高的过程，现有AI系统难以完全自动化。需要解决高质量、多模态金融报告生成的技术挑战。

Method: 采用Code Agent with Variable Memory (CAVM)架构统一外部数据、设计工具和智能体；提出迭代视觉增强机制逐步优化原始视觉输出；使用两阶段写作框架将简洁的分析链扩展为连贯的、引用感知的多模态报告。

Result: 在各种公司和行业级任务上的实验表明，FinSight在事实准确性、分析深度和呈现质量方面显著优于所有基线系统，包括领先的深度研究系统。

Conclusion: FinSight展示了生成接近人类专家质量报告的技术路径，通过多智能体框架有效解决了专业金融报告生成的挑战。

Abstract: Generating professional financial reports is a labor-intensive and
intellectually demanding process that current AI systems struggle to fully
automate. To address this challenge, we introduce FinSight (Financial InSight),
a novel multi agent framework for producing high-quality, multimodal financial
reports. The foundation of FinSight is the Code Agent with Variable Memory
(CAVM) architecture, which unifies external data, designed tools, and agents
into a programmable variable space, enabling flexible data collection, analysis
and report generation through executable code. To ensure professional-grade
visualization, we propose an Iterative Vision-Enhanced Mechanism that
progressively refines raw visual outputs into polished financial charts.
Furthermore, a two stage Writing Framework expands concise Chain-of-Analysis
segments into coherent, citation-aware, and multimodal reports, ensuring both
analytical depth and structural consistency. Experiments on various company and
industry-level tasks demonstrate that FinSight significantly outperforms all
baselines, including leading deep research systems in terms of factual
accuracy, analytical depth, and presentation quality, demonstrating a clear
path toward generating reports that approach human-expert quality.

TL;DR: 提出神经群通信（NGC）框架，将神经网络重新构想为交互神经群的动态系统，通过低维信号交换实现参数压缩，在保持推理能力的同时提升模型效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代神经网络规模不断扩大带来的效率和可解释性挑战，构建能够学习高效、模块化和可解释表示的大型神经系统的核心问题。

Method: 将神经网络视为神经群交互的动态系统，权重作为神经状态间的瞬时交互，神经计算通过神经群间的迭代通信展开，引入神经元稳定性度量来量化序列处理中的稳定模式。

Result: 在大语言模型中实例化NGC，在适度压缩下在复杂推理基准上表现更优，在相同压缩率下持续优于标准低秩近似和跨层基共享方法。

Conclusion: NGC框架通过结构化神经群动态实现高效压缩，同时保持推理能力，为高维学习系统中的泛化提供了新的理论视角。

Abstract: The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented
performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability.
This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems
that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose
Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a
neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than
a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as
an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient
interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation
unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This
low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons
exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and
inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant
parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal
stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the
contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence
processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities
correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the
neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability.
Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate
improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate
compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and
cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude
by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured
neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional
learning systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了基于心理学感知理论的多模态具身知识理解基准，发现视觉语言模型在具身知识理解上并不优于纯文本模型，且在视觉维度表现最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉基础是否能增强多模态语言模型对具身知识的理解，与纯文本模型相比。

Method: 构建基于心理学感知理论的具身知识理解基准，包含视觉、听觉、触觉、味觉、嗅觉和内部感知六个维度，通过向量比较和问答任务评估30个先进语言模型。

Result: 视觉语言模型在具身知识理解任务中并不优于纯文本模型；模型在视觉维度表现显著差于其他感官维度；向量表示易受词形和频率影响；模型在空间感知和推理问题上表现困难。

Conclusion: 需要更有效地将具身知识整合到语言模型中，以增强其对物理世界的理解能力。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal language models (LMs), it remains
unclear whether visual grounding enhances their understanding of embodied
knowledge compared to text-only models. To address this question, we propose a
novel embodied knowledge understanding benchmark based on the perceptual theory
from psychology, encompassing visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory
external senses, and interoception. The benchmark assesses the models'
perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector
comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing
30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models
(VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models
perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory
dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily
influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer
questions involving spatial perception and reasoning. Our findings underscore
the need for more effective integration of embodied knowledge in LMs to enhance
their understanding of the physical world.

TL;DR: ChiKhaPo是一个大规模多语言基准测试，包含8个不同难度的子任务，用于评估生成模型在2700多种语言中的词汇理解和生成能力，填补了现有基准测试在低资源语言覆盖方面的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型基准测试主要针对高资源或中资源语言，且多关注推理和生成等高阶任务，但大量证据表明LLMs在全球3800多种书面语言中缺乏基本语言能力。

Method: 利用现有词典、单语数据和双语平行语料构建ChiKhaPo基准，包含8个不同难度的子任务，覆盖2700多种语言，重点关注词汇理解和生成能力。

Result: 6个最先进的模型在该基准测试中表现不佳，性能得分受到语言家族、语言资源丰富度、任务类型以及理解与生成方向等因素的影响。

Conclusion: ChiKhaPo基准测试旨在促进和鼓励大语言模型的大规模多语言基准测试，填补了低资源语言评估的空白。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) are largely restricted
to high- or mid-resource languages, and often evaluate performance on
higher-order tasks in reasoning and generation. However, plenty of evidence
points to the fact that LLMs lack basic linguistic competence in the vast
majority of the world's 3800+ written languages. We introduce ChiKhaPo,
consisting of 8 subtasks of varying difficulty designed to evaluate the lexical
comprehension and generation abilities of generative models. ChiKhaPo draws on
existing lexicons, monolingual data, and bitext, and provides coverage for
2700+ languages for 2 subtasks, surpassing any existing benchmark in terms of
language coverage. We further show that 6 SOTA models struggle on our
benchmark, and discuss the factors contributing to performance scores,
including language family, language resourcedness, task, and comprehension
versus generation directions. With ChiKhaPo, we hope to enable and encourage
the massively multilingual benchmarking of LLMs.

TL;DR: PROMPT-MII是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于元学习指令归纳模型，能够为任意新数据集生成紧凑指令，实现与上下文学习相当的性能但大幅减少推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 上下文学习虽然有效但推理成本高，随着上下文长度增长而增加。需要一种方法能够将训练示例压缩为紧凑但描述性的提示。

Method: 提出PROMPT-MII框架，使用强化学习元学习指令归纳模型，在3,000多个多样化分类数据集上训练，能够为任意新数据集动态生成紧凑指令。

Result: 在90个未见任务上评估，PROMPT-MII将下游模型质量提高了4-9个F1点（相对提升10-20%），匹配上下文学习性能同时需要3-13倍更少的token。

Conclusion: PROMPT-MII能够有效减少大语言模型适应新任务时的推理成本，同时保持或提升模型性能，为高效模型适应提供了可行方案。

Abstract: A popular method to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new tasks is
in-context learning (ICL), which is effective but incurs high inference costs
as context length grows. In this paper we propose a method to perform
instruction induction, where we take training examples and reduce them to a
compact but descriptive prompt that can achieve performance comparable to ICL
over the full training set. Specifically, we propose PROMPT-MII, a
reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to meta-learn an instruction
induction model that can generate compact instructions on the fly for an
arbitrary new dataset. We train on over 3,000 diverse classification datasets
from the HuggingFace hub, and evaluate on 90 unseen tasks. PROMPT-MII improves
downstream model quality by 4-9 F1 points (10-20% relative), matching ICL
performance while requiring 3-13x fewer tokens.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次将参数高效微调(PEFT)应用于孟加拉语仇恨言论检测，使用LoRA和QLoRA技术在三个大型语言模型上进行微调，在BD-SHS数据集上取得了最高92.23%的F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语社交媒体上的仇恨言论急剧增加，特别是针对妇女和青少年。现有方法要么计算成本高，要么依赖专有API，需要更实用高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用LoRA和QLoRA参数高效微调技术，在Gemma-3-4B、Llama-3.2-3B和Mistral-7B三个指令调优大语言模型上微调，仅训练少于1%的参数，在单张消费级GPU上完成实验。

Result: Llama-3.2-3B获得最高F1分数92.23%，Mistral-7B为88.94%，Gemma-3-4B为80.25%，证明了PEFT方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PEFT是孟加拉语及相关低资源语言仇恨言论检测的实用且可复现策略，为低资源语言NLP任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Bengali social media platforms have witnessed a sharp increase in hate
speech, disproportionately affecting women and adolescents. While datasets such
as BD-SHS provide a basis for structured evaluation, most prior approaches rely
on either computationally costly full-model fine-tuning or proprietary APIs.
This paper presents the first application of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) for Bengali hate speech detection using LoRA and QLoRA. Three
instruction-tuned large language models - Gemma-3-4B, Llama-3.2-3B, and
Mistral-7B - were fine-tuned on the BD-SHS dataset of 50,281 annotated
comments. Each model was adapted by training fewer than 1% of its parameters,
enabling experiments on a single consumer-grade GPU. The results show that
Llama-3.2-3B achieved the highest F1-score of 92.23%, followed by Mistral-7B at
88.94% and Gemma-3-4B at 80.25%. These findings establish PEFT as a practical
and replicable strategy for Bengali and related low-resource languages.

*Amit Moryossef,Clara Meister,Pavel Stepachev,Desmond Elliott*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UTF8Tokenizer是一个极简的字节级分词器，直接将文本映射到UTF-8编码对应的字节ID，使用C0控制字节编码特殊行为，具有快速分词、低传输开销和可共享嵌入表等优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字节级分词方法存在超出范围的ID或需要辅助标记的问题，作者希望设计一个更简洁高效的分词器，利用ASCII原始设计理念，通过C0控制字节统一处理所有特殊行为。

Method: 采用字节级映射方法，将文本直接对应到UTF-8编码的字节ID，所有特殊功能（如填充、边界、对话结构等）都使用C0控制字节编码，无需额外标记。

Result: 实现了14倍的分词速度提升，主机-设备传输减少8倍，支持256*d的可共享嵌入表，并通过位偏置嵌入技术改进语言模型收敛。

Conclusion: UTF8Tokenizer提供了一个高效、简洁的分词方案，利用C0控制字节的统一编码机制，在性能和实用性方面都有显著提升，且与HuggingFace兼容。

Abstract: We present UTF8Tokenizer, a minimalist byte-level tokenizer that maps text
exactly to IDs corresponding to the bytes underlying the text's UTF-8 encoding
(e.g., byte x09 is token ID 9). Unlike prior byte-level approaches (Xue et al.,
2021; Pagnoni et al., 2025), our implementation never introduces out-of-range
IDs (i.e. there is no token ID 256) or auxiliary tokens: all special behavior
(e.g., padding, boundaries, conversation structure, attention segments, tool
calling, "thinking" spans, etc.) is encoded using C0 control bytes - just as
ASCII was originally designed to embed control information alongside printable
text. These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization
(14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2)
simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and
(3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes
per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training,
removing inference costs. Our HuggingFace-compatible implementation improves
language modeling convergence.

*Yuval Reif,Guy Kaplan,Roy Schwartz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种词汇表压缩方法，通过将词形变化表示为基词向量加变换向量的组合，而非为每个表面形式分配独立token，从而释放词汇表空间用于更多样化的词汇。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准分词算法将词形变化视为独立token，导致词汇表被表面形式变体填满，牺牲了低频词和多语言覆盖。需要更紧凑的词汇表设计来利用语言的内在结构。

Method: 使用变换向量（加性偏移）来表示词形变化，将词汇表重新设计为共享基词和变换向量的组合形式，而不修改模型权重。

Result: 在多个LLM和五种语言上测试，最多可移除10%的词汇表条目，扩展了词汇覆盖范围，对下游任务性能影响最小。

Conclusion: 词汇表设计应从字符串枚举转向组合式词汇表，充分利用语言的基础结构。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) were shown to encode word form variations, such
as "walk"->"walked", as linear directions in embedding space. However, standard
tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling
the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., "walk", "walking",
"Walk"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We
show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors --
additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied
to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces.
Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than
assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base
form and transformation vectors (e.g., "walked" = "walk" + past tense). We
apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to
10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more
diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage
to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and
without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational
rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a
compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态防御框架，通过在线学习对抗迭代越狱攻击，显著提升了LLMs的安全性同时保持无害任务响应质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法无法主动破坏迭代越狱攻击的动态试错循环，这些攻击通过重复重写提示词来诱导有害输出

Method: 使用强化学习动态优化提示词，确保无害任务适当响应同时明确拒绝有害提示；引入Past-Direction Gradient Damping防止对攻击中窄带输入重写过拟合

Result: 在三个LLMs上的实验显示，该方法显著优于五种现有防御方法，对抗五种迭代越狱攻击；同时提升了无害任务的响应质量

Conclusion: 该框架通过动态更新防御策略有效对抗迭代越狱攻击，在保持安全性的同时提升了模型性能

Abstract: Iterative jailbreak methods that repeatedly rewrite and input prompts into
large language models (LLMs) to induce harmful outputs -- using the model's
previous responses to guide each new iteration -- have been found to be a
highly effective attack strategy. Despite being an effective attack strategy
against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively
disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel
framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning
in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the
distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless
prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes
prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly
rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band
of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce
Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs
show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods
against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that
our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for
harmless tasks.

Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试主要关注自然语言理解中的显式信息提取，缺乏针对隐式信息、语用推理和跨句子/段落/多说话者话语的话语跟踪的更具挑战性的多语言基准。

Method: 提出了DiscoTrack基准测试，涵盖12种语言和四个话语理解层次：显著性识别、实体跟踪、话语关系和桥接推理。

Result: 评估显示，即使对于最先进的模型，这些任务仍然具有挑战性。

Conclusion: DiscoTrack填补了现有基准测试的空白，为评估LLM在话语跟踪和隐式推理能力方面提供了更全面的多语言测试平台。

Abstract: Recent LLM benchmarks have tested models on a range of phenomena, but are
still focused primarily on natural language understanding for extraction of
explicit information, such as QA or summarization, with responses often tar-
geting information from individual sentences. We are still lacking more
challenging, and im- portantly also multilingual, benchmarks focus- ing on
implicit information and pragmatic infer- ences across larger documents in the
context of discourse tracking: integrating and aggregating information across
sentences, paragraphs and multiple speaker utterances. To this end, we present
DiscoTrack, an LLM benchmark target- ing a range of tasks across 12 languages
and four levels of discourse understanding: salience recognition, entity
tracking, discourse relations and bridging inference. Our evaluation shows that
these tasks remain challenging, even for state-of-the-art models.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现基于大语言模型的搜索代理比基础模型更容易产生有害输出，提出了SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，在保持问答性能的同时显著降低有害性。


<details>

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注提升搜索代理的实用性，但其安全行为尚未充分探索。研究发现搜索代理在处理有害问题时可能降低拒绝阈值，通过检索外部信息合成不安全内容。

Method: 提出SafeSearch多目标强化学习方法，结合最终输出的安全/效用奖励和查询级别的整形项，惩罚不安全查询并奖励安全查询。

Result: 实验显示SafeSearch在三个红队测试数据集上减少代理有害性超过70%，同时产生安全有用的回答，与仅优化效用的微调代理保持相当的问答性能。

Conclusion: 查询级别的奖励在联合改进安全性和效用方面具有有效性，证明了联合对齐安全性和效用的重要性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based search agents iteratively generate queries,
retrieve external information, and reason to answer open-domain questions.
While researchers have primarily focused on improving their utility, their
safety behaviors remain underexplored. In this paper, we first evaluate search
agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce
harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track
someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a
search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal
threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize
them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that
utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment
of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement
learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a
novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe
ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70%
across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and
matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses
confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety
and utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的模型计算成本高且在少数毒性类别上性能下降的问题，以及传统集成方法缺乏语义适应性的局限性。

Method: 使用可学习的参考向量通过余弦相似度调节上下文嵌入，集成多源嵌入（GloVe、FastText、BERT CLS），包含字符级BiLSTM用于形态学线索、嵌入空间SMOTE用于少数类增强，以及自适应焦点损失和动态类别加权。

Result: 在Jigsaw Toxic Comment基准测试中，xLSTM在威胁类别上比BERT提升33%，在身份仇恨类别上提升28%，推理延迟50ms，余弦门控在消融实验中贡献+4.8% F1增益。

Conclusion: 轻量级、理论指导的架构可以在不平衡、特定领域的NLP任务上超越大型预训练模型，建立了新的效率-适应性边界。

Abstract: Toxic comment detection remains a challenging task, where transformer-based
models (e.g., BERT) incur high computational costs and degrade on minority
toxicity classes, while classical ensembles lack semantic adaptability. We
propose xLSTM, a parameter-efficient and theoretically grounded framework that
unifies cosine-similarity gating, adaptive feature prioritization, and
principled class rebalancing. A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d
modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues
and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class
imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS)
through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues,
embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with
dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains
96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28%
on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference
latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations. The results
establish a new efficiency adaptability frontier, demonstrating that
lightweight, theoretically informed architectures can surpass large pretrained
models on imbalanced, domain-specific NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究大语言模型的提示敏感性现象，提出通过语义空间采样和改述扰动来改善不确定性校准，并引入新的不确定性分解指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型对语义相同但表述不同的提示会产生不同答案分布，这表明模型输出的不确定性可能无法反映对提示含义的真实不确定性。

Method: 将提示敏感性建模为泛化误差，通过语义概念空间的改述扰动进行采样，并设计新的不确定性分解指标来量化提示敏感性带来的不确定性。

Result: 语义空间采样改进了不确定性校准而不影响准确性，新分解指标能有效量化提示敏感性在LLM不确定性中的贡献。

Conclusion: 该方法为改善提示敏感语言模型的不确定性校准提供了新途径，证明某些LLM未能对其输入含义展现一致的一般推理能力。

Abstract: An interesting behavior in large language models (LLMs) is prompt
sensitivity. When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions
of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers.
This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution
for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the
prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show
that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing
perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy.
Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in
black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling
semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this
decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is
attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve
uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides
evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the
meanings of their inputs.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了基于推理的大语言模型在思维过程中如何聚合社会偏见，发现了两种导致偏见加剧的失败模式，并提出了一种轻量级的提示缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于推理的大语言模型通过内部结构化思维过程在复杂任务中表现出色，但这种现象可能会聚合社会刻板印象，导致有偏见的结果。然而，语言模型在社交偏见场景中的底层行为仍未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统研究思维过程中的机制，发现了两种驱动社会偏见聚合的失败模式：刻板印象重复和无关信息注入。基于这些发现，引入了一种轻量级的基于提示的缓解方法，让模型根据这些特定失败模式审查自己的初始推理。

Result: 在问答（BBQ和StereoSet）和开放式（BOLD）基准测试上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了偏见，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了语言模型思维过程中社会偏见聚合的机制，并提出了一种有效的缓解方法，能够在减少偏见的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: While reasoning-based large language models excel at complex tasks through an
internal, structured thinking process, a concerning phenomenon has emerged that
such a thinking process can aggregate social stereotypes, leading to biased
outcomes. However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social
bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically
investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and
uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype
repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary
justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or
introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these
insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that
queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific
failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and
open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias
while maintaining or improving accuracy.

TL;DR: VeriMAP是一个用于多智能体协作的验证感知规划框架，通过分解任务、建模子任务依赖关系，并将规划器定义的通过标准编码为Python和自然语言的验证函数，解决多智能体协作中的规划、协调和验证挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协作在解决复杂任务时面临规划、协调和验证的新挑战，执行失败往往源于任务解释、输出格式或智能体间交接的细微偏差，而非单纯的推理缺陷。

Method: VeriMAP框架包括任务分解、子任务依赖建模，并将规划器定义的通过标准编码为Python和自然语言的子任务验证函数。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的评估表明，VeriMAP优于单智能体和多智能体基线，同时增强了系统的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 验证感知规划能够在多智能体系统中实现可靠的协调和迭代优化，无需依赖外部标签或注释。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex
tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents.
However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning,
coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from
flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation,
output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present
VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware
planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies,
and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions
(VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets,
demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while
enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how
verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative
refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or
annotations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DVAGen是一个开源统一框架，用于训练、评估和可视化动态词汇增强语言模型，解决了现有方法代码库碎片化、缺乏对现代LLM支持以及推理可扩展性有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定词汇表训练的语言模型难以泛化到新词或词汇表外词，限制了处理多样化词组合的灵活性。现有动态词汇方法存在代码库碎片化、缺乏现代LLM支持和推理可扩展性有限等挑战。

Method: DVAGen框架模块化流水线以便定制，无缝集成开源LLM，首次提供CLI和WebUI工具进行实时结果检查，支持批量推理。

Result: 验证了动态词汇方法在现代LLM上的有效性，显著提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: DVAGen通过统一的动态词汇增强框架，解决了现有方法的局限性，为语言模型提供了更好的词汇泛化能力和推理效率。

Abstract: Language models trained with a fixed vocabulary struggle to generalize to
novel or out-of-vocabulary words, limiting their flexibility in handling
diverse token combinations. Existing dynamic vocabulary approaches attempt to
address this limitation but face challenges such as fragmented codebases, lack
of support for modern LLMs, and limited inference scalability. To overcome
these issues, we introduce DVAGen, a fully open-source, unified framework
designed for training, evaluation, and visualization of dynamic
vocabulary-augmented language models. Our framework modularizes the pipeline
for ease of customization, integrates seamlessly with open-source LLMs, and is
the first to provide both CLI and WebUI tools for real-time result inspection.
We validate the effectiveness of dynamic vocabulary methods on modern LLMs and
demonstrate support for batch inference, significantly improving inference
throughput.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了基于提示和基于强化学习的查询增强方法，发现简单的无训练查询增强方法通常与更昂贵的基于强化学习的方法表现相当甚至更好，并提出了结合两者优势的混合方法OPQE。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较基于提示和基于强化学习的查询增强方法在一致实验条件下的表现，探索更有效的查询增强策略。

Method: 提出了OPQE方法，让LLM策略学习生成最大化检索性能的伪文档，结合了提示的灵活性和RL的针对性优化。

Result: 简单无训练的查询增强方法表现与基于强化学习的方法相当或更好；OPQE方法优于单独的提示方法和基于强化学习的重写方法。

Conclusion: 协同方法能产生最佳结果，结合提示的灵活性和RL的针对性优化是最有效的查询增强策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of
interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main
approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or
pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's
parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies
reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly
optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and
limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent
experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic
comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse
benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key
finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par
with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when
using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid
method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of
rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that
maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative
structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE
outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating
that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made
available to facilitate reproducibility.

TL;DR: 研究表明人们在理解AI生成的讽刺时不会完全采用意向立场，神经数据显示P200和P600效应减弱，表明对AI的沟通意图归因减少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地被部署为社交代理并训练产生幽默和讽刺，需要研究人们是否会对AI采用意向立场，将心理状态归因于AI行为

Method: 比较AI与人类来源讽刺语句的行为和神经反应，使用ERP成分：P200反映早期不一致性检测，P600反映重新解释不一致性为故意讽刺的认知努力

Result: 行为上参与者对AI的故意沟通归因显著少于人类；神经数据显示AI生成讽刺的P200和P600效应减弱，表明检测和重新分析努力减少；认为AI更真诚的人对AI讽刺表现出更大的P200和P600效应

Conclusion: 尽管当前LLM具有语言复杂性，但实现真正的社交代理需要超越语言能力，需要人类对人工代理的意向性归因方式发生转变

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as social agents
and trained to produce humor and irony, a question emerges: when encountering
witty AI remarks, do people interpret these as intentional communication or
mere computational output? This study investigates whether people adopt the
intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI
during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it
requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors
through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural
responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established
ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing
cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results
demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward
AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to
deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI
than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as
computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis
consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people
who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for
AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated
by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that
source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena.
Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social
agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how
humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.

*Jiaqi Leng,Xiang Hu,Junxiong Wang,Jianguo Li,Wei Wu,Yucheng Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了基于分块稀疏注意力的长上下文模型，提出了三个关键设计原则：表达性分块编码器、旁路残差路径和强制选择稀疏性，实现了从4K到3200万token的无训练长度外推。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer受限于二次复杂度，而滑动窗口注意力等替代架构无法有效利用完整上下文。分块稀疏注意力是极长长度外推的有前景范式，但其成功的关键架构原理尚未完全理解。

Method: 通过统一框架和全面消融研究，识别出三个关键设计原则：(1) 具有专用CLS token的表达性非线性分块编码器；(2) 旁路残差路径稳定整合全局信息；(3) 预训练期间的强制选择稀疏性以弥合训练-测试分布差距。

Result: 结合这些原则，在RULER和BABILong上实现了从4K上下文训练到3200万token的无训练长度外推，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 研究为开发未来高能力长上下文语言模型提供了一套清晰且经验基础的设计原则。

Abstract: Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and
BABILong. Our findings provide a clear and empirically-grounded set of design
principles for developing future, highly-capable long-context language models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的注意力转移框架，通过上下文保留抑制和抗幻觉响应塑造来解决大语言模型遗忘中的效用与幻觉困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法面临两难：激进遗忘会损害模型效用，保守策略保留效用但会产生幻觉响应，这限制了LLM在知识密集型应用中的可靠性。

Method: AS框架包含两个注意力级干预：重要性感知抑制（减少对遗忘集记忆知识的依赖）和注意力引导保留增强（强化保留集中语义重要token的注意力），通过双损失目标联合优化。

Result: 在ToFU基准上准确率提升15%，TDEC基准上提升10%，同时保持竞争力的无幻觉遗忘效果，在遗忘效果、泛化性和响应可靠性之间实现了优越平衡。

Conclusion: AS框架通过局部化遗忘同时保留不相关知识，在表示叠加下实现了遗忘效果与模型效用的更好平衡，显著提升了LLM在知识密集型应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: The increase in computing power and the necessity of AI-assisted
decision-making boost the growing application of large language models (LLMs).
Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred
increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning
approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model
utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated
responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive
applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS)
framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1)
context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens
without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant
response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about
unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level
interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning
set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention
enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in
the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components
are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary
that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under
representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves
performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods,
achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC
benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning
effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance
between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.

*Junlong Tong,Yingqi Fan,Anhao Zhao,Yunpu Ma,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了StreamingThinker框架，让大语言模型能够在读取输入时就开始推理，而不是等待完整输入，从而显著降低延迟并保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理范式需要等待完整输入后才开始思考，这带来了不必要的延迟，且在动态场景下会削弱对早期信息的注意力。受人类边阅读边思考的认知方式启发，设计流式思考范式。

Method: StreamingThinker框架整合了流式CoT生成、流式约束训练和流式并行推理。使用流式推理单元进行质量控制的CoT生成，通过流式注意力掩码和位置编码保持推理顺序，利用并行KV缓存实现输入编码与推理生成的解耦。

Result: 在Qwen3模型系列上的数学推理、逻辑推理和基于上下文的QA推理任务中，StreamingThinker保持了与批处理思考相当的性能，同时使推理开始前的token等待时间减少80%，最终答案生成的时间级延迟减少60%以上。

Conclusion: 流式思考范式有效解决了LLM推理延迟问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率，为动态场景下的实时推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm
initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces
unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic
scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first
design a \textit{\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where
reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once
reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with
\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading
through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint
training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker
employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation,
enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and
position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input
encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling
true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across
math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks.
Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance
comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\% reduction in token waiting
before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\% reduction in time-level
latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning. Code will be released at
\href{https://github.com/EIT-NLP/StreamingLLM/tree/main/StreamingThinker}{this

TL;DR: 本文提出了VideoBiasEval框架，用于评估视频生成中的社会偏见，发现对齐调优会强化并稳定化社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频扩散模型通过奖励模型进行对齐调优，虽然提升了视觉质量，但可能无意中编码和放大了社会偏见。

Method: 引入VideoBiasEval诊断框架，基于社会偏见分类学，采用基于事件的提示策略，分离语义内容和演员属性，并引入多粒度指标进行评估。

Result: 对齐调优不仅强化了代表性偏见，还使其在时间上更稳定，产生更平滑但更刻板的描绘。

Conclusion: 需要在对齐过程中进行偏见感知的评估和缓解，以确保公平和负责任的视频生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have significantly enhanced
text-to-video generation, particularly through alignment tuning using reward
models trained on human preferences. While these methods improve visual
quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To
systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline,
we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating
social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias
taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to
disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes
(gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to
evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity,
(3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4)
the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we
conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference
datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through
alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment
tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them
temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These
findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout
the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.

Motivation: 研究新闻媒体如何通过情感框架影响公众情绪，探索负面或情绪化标题吸引更多关注和传播更快的现象。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 4B进行零样本推理，分析了30万条孟加拉语新闻标题及其内容，识别每篇文章的主导情绪和整体基调。

Result: 发现负面情绪明显占主导地位，特别是愤怒、恐惧和失望情绪，不同媒体对相似故事的情感呈现存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 基于研究结果，提出了以人为本的新闻聚合器设计理念，通过可视化情感线索帮助读者识别日常新闻中隐藏的情感框架。

Abstract: News media often shape the public mood not only by what they report but by
how they frame it. The same event can appear calm in one outlet and alarming in
another, reflecting subtle emotional bias in reporting. Negative or emotionally
charged headlines tend to attract more attention and spread faster, which in
turn encourages outlets to frame stories in ways that provoke stronger
reactions. This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion
analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we
analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the
dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear
dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment,
and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed
across outlets. Based on these insights, we propose design ideas for a
human-centered news aggregator that visualizes emotional cues and helps readers
recognize hidden affective framing in daily news.

Abstract: Large language models have exhibited impressive performance across a broad
range of downstream tasks in natural language processing. However, how a
language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally
understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in
prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the
urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of
language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this
gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust
in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions.
First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic
interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the
literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and
reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and
autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations
for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in
the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities,
critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned,
trustworthy LLM explanations.

Method: 提出TaxoAlign方法，这是一个基于主题的三阶段指令引导的学术分类法生成方法，并建立了包含460个分类法的CS-TaxoBench基准数据集。

Result: TaxoAlign在几乎所有评估指标上都持续优于基线方法，通过自动评估和人工评估验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: TaxoAlign方法能够有效弥合人工生成和自动创建分类法之间的差距，为学术分类法生成提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Taxonomies play a crucial role in helping researchers structure and navigate
knowledge in a hierarchical manner. They also form an important part in the
creation of comprehensive literature surveys. The existing approaches to
automatic survey generation do not compare the structure of the generated
surveys with those written by human experts. To address this gap, we present
our own method for automated taxonomy creation that can bridge the gap between
human-generated and automatically-created taxonomies. For this purpose, we
create the CS-TaxoBench benchmark which consists of 460 taxonomies that have
been extracted from human-written survey papers. We also include an additional
test set of 80 taxonomies curated from conference survey papers. We propose
TaxoAlign, a three-phase topic-based instruction-guided method for scholarly
taxonomy generation. Additionally, we propose a stringent automated evaluation
framework that measures the structural alignment and semantic coherence of
automatically generated taxonomies in comparison to those created by human
experts. We evaluate our method and various baselines on CS-TaxoBench, using
both automated evaluation metrics and human evaluation studies. The results
show that TaxoAlign consistently surpasses the baselines on nearly all metrics.

Motivation: 社交媒体上的反社会行为（如仇恨言论、骚扰和网络霸凌）对平台安全和社福祉构成风险，但现有研究主要关注X和Reddit等网络，多轮对话环境因数据有限而研究不足。

Method: 使用CyberAgressionAdo-Large数据集，评估了6种基于文本和8种基于图的表示学习方法，分析词汇线索、交互动态及其多模态融合。

Result: 多模态模型优于单模态基线，晚期融合模型mBERT + WD-SGCN在反社会行为检测上表现最佳（0.718），在同伴群体识别（0.286）和霸凌分析（0.606）上也有竞争力。

Conclusion: 多模态方法能有效处理隐式攻击、角色转换和情境依赖的敌意等细微反社会行为现象。

Abstract: Antisocial behavior (ASB) on social media -- including hate speech,
harassment, and cyberbullying -- poses growing risks to platform safety and
societal well-being. Prior research has focused largely on networks such as X
and Reddit, while \textit{multi-party conversational settings} remain
underexplored due to limited data. To address this gap, we use
\textit{CyberAgressionAdo-Large}, a French open-access dataset simulating ASB
in multi-party conversations, and evaluate three tasks: \textit{abuse
detection}, \textit{bullying behavior analysis}, and \textit{bullying
peer-group identification}. We benchmark six text-based and eight graph-based
\textit{representation-learning methods}, analyzing lexical cues, interactional
dynamics, and their multimodal fusion. Results show that multimodal models
outperform unimodal baselines. The late fusion model \texttt{mBERT + WD-SGCN}
achieves the best overall results, with top performance on abuse detection
(0.718) and competitive scores on peer-group identification (0.286) and
bullying analysis (0.606). Error analysis highlights its effectiveness in
handling nuanced ASB phenomena such as implicit aggression, role transitions,

Result: Nyx不仅在标准文本RAG基准测试中表现优异，在更通用和现实的URAG设置中表现更突出，显著提升了视觉语言任务的生成质量。

Conclusion: Nyx为混合模态检索增强生成提供了有效的解决方案，通过统一的多模态检索器和高质量数据集构建方法，成功解决了现实世界中的多模态信息检索挑战。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
enhancing large language models (LLMs) by retrieving relevant documents from an
external corpus. However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text
documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and
documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this
paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to
improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified
mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate
the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated
pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct
NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that
better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality
dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform
pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets,
followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream
vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative
preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs
competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more
general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality
in vision-language tasks.

### [252] [The Atomic Instruction Gap: Instruction-Tuned LLMs Struggle with Simple, Self-Contained Directives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17388)
*Henry Lim,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现指令调优的大语言模型在简单指令执行上存在不足，对选项标签格式敏感，且缺乏对原子指令的忠实遵循能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大语言模型展现出强大的零样本推理能力，但其执行简单、自包含指令的能力尚未得到充分探索，而这正是复杂指令遵循的基础。

Method: 在修改后的MMLU和MMLU-Pro基准上评估20个指令调优大语言模型，系统性地改变选项标签格式（字母、数字、罗马数字），在四种范式下测试：有明确指令、无指令、移除选项内容、三样本示例。

Result: 标签格式变化导致性能显著波动（如罗马数字vs数字下降30.45%）；无指令时性能进一步下降（最多-10.84%）；移除选项内容时除数字标签外均无法通过随机选择基线；三样本示例无法显著提升鲁棒性；大模型准确率更高但指令遵循仍不一致。

Conclusion: 当前指令调优范式存在不足，需要专门针对原子指令遵循的评估方法和训练策略。

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (IT-LLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
reasoning, yet their ability to execute simple, self-contained instructions
remains underexplored, despite this being foundational to complex
instruction-following. We evaluate 20 IT-LLMs on modified MMLU and MMLU-Pro
benchmarks, by systematically varying the format of option labels (alphabetic,
numeric, Roman) while keeping their meaning identical under four paradigms,
namely: (1) With explicit instructions, label changes cause large performance
shifts (e.g., -30.45\% for Roman vs. numeric), revealing instruction-format
bias. (2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\%) and
label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3)
When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except
with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4)
Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and
generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric
formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain
inconsistent in instruction adherence. These results expose the insufficiencies
of current instruction-tuning paradigms and highlight the need for evaluation
methods and training strategies that explicitly target atomic
instruction-following.

TL;DR: 提出了EduAdapt基准数据集，包含近48k个按年级标注的问答对，用于评估LLM在不同年级水平上的适应性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在教育应用中虽然表现良好，但缺乏针对不同年级学生的适应性，无法根据学生的认知发展阶段提供合适的解释和词汇。

Method: 创建了涵盖9个科学科目、从1年级到12年级的问答数据集，将年级分为四个水平组，评估了多种开源LLM的表现。

Result: 大型模型整体表现更好，但在为低年级学生（1-5年级）生成合适回答方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估LLM年级适应性的数据集和框架，旨在通过改进训练和提示策略开发更适合教育发展的AI系统。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are transforming education by answering
questions, explaining complex concepts, and generating content across a wide
range of subjects. Despite strong performance on academic benchmarks, they
often fail to tailor responses to students' grade levels. This is a critical
need in K-12 education, where age-appropriate vocabulary and explanation are
essential for effective learning. Existing models frequently produce outputs
that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no
standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive
and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a
benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects,
spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse
set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally
perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for
early-grade students (Grades 1-5). Our work presents the first dataset and
evaluation framework for assessing grade-level adaptability in LLMs, aiming to
foster more developmentally aligned educational AI systems through better
training and prompting strategies. EduAdapt code and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/NaumanNaeem/EduAdapt.

TL;DR: Ladder-base是首个采用GRPO强化学习方法训练的中医专用大语言模型，在多个推理指标上超越了通用LLM和中医领域模型，展示了GRPO在传统医学领域对齐专家级推理的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统中医知识体系独特且复杂，现有中医专用LLM存在对齐不足、数据质量差和评估不一致等问题，需要更有效的训练方法来提升推理能力和事实一致性。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct基础模型，使用GRPO强化学习方法，在TCM-Ladder基准的文本子集上进行训练，80%数据用于训练，剩余20%平均分为验证集和测试集。

Result: Ladder-base在标准化评估中，在多个推理指标上超越了GPT-4、Gemini 2.5、Claude 3、Qwen3等通用LLM，以及BenTsao、HuatuoGPT2、Zhongjing等中医领域模型。

Conclusion: GRPO为LLM在传统医学领域对齐专家级推理提供了有效且高效的策略，支持开发可信赖且具有临床基础的中医人工智能系统。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) presents a rich and structurally unique
knowledge system that challenges conventional applications of large language
models (LLMs). Although previous TCM-specific LLMs have shown progress through
supervised fine-tuning, they often face limitations in alignment, data quality,
and evaluation consistency. In this study, we introduce Ladder-base, the first
TCM-focused LLM trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
reinforcement learning method that improves reasoning and factual consistency
by optimizing response selection based on intra-group comparisons. Ladder-base
is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively
on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data
for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and
test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior
performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both
state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and
Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and
Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient
strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical
domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM
artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: 研究表明通过自然语言指令调优和多模态整合开发中医领域大语言模型是可行的，为生成式AI与传统医学推理的对齐提供了实用框架和可扩展的实际部署路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning
and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning
generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for
real-world deployment.

*Tiancheng Hu,Benjamin Minixhofer,Nigel Collier*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现对齐后训练不仅导致任务准确率下降，还会造成严重的校准损失，使模型过度自信、可靠性降低。通过简单的权重插值方法可以缓解这一问题，找到帕累托最优的模型，在提升准确率的同时改善校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示对齐后训练带来的完整代价——不仅是任务准确率下降，还包括严重的校准损失，导致模型过度自信和可靠性降低。

Method: 采用简单的后处理干预：在模型对齐前后的权重之间进行插值，寻找帕累托最优的插值点。

Result: 该方法能够找到同时超越两个父模型准确率的模型，并显著恢复对齐过程中损失的校准性能，证明这不是严格的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 简单的模型合并提供了一种计算高效的方法来缓解对齐代价的完整范围，产生更强大且更可靠的模型。

Abstract: The "alignment tax" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task
accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models
overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this
trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention:
interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially,
this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals
Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both
parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment.
Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally
efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding
models that are more capable and more reliable.

*Yushi Yang,Shreyansh Padarha,Andrew Lee,Adam Mahdi*

TL;DR: RL训练的搜索模型具有脆弱的安全性，两种简单攻击（搜索攻击和多搜索攻击）能显著降低模型的安全性能，暴露了当前RL训练方法在安全性方面的核心弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RL训练的搜索模型的安全性特性，这些模型在推理任务中表现出色但安全性未被充分理解。

Method: 使用两种简单攻击方法：搜索攻击（强制模型以搜索开始响应）和多搜索攻击（鼓励模型重复搜索），在Qwen和Llama两个模型家族上进行测试。

Result: 攻击使拒绝率降低高达60.0%，答案安全性降低82.5%，搜索查询安全性降低82.4%。攻击通过触发模型生成有害的、镜像请求的搜索查询来绕过安全机制。

Conclusion: 当前RL训练方法存在核心弱点，只奖励有效查询的生成而不考虑其危害性，迫切需要开发安全感知的智能RL流程来优化安全搜索。

Abstract: Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to
autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common
application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety
properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained
search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful
requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile.
Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search
(Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search
(Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across
two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks
lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query
safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful,
request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal
tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards
continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their
harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can
easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines
optimising for safe search.

Conclusion: 基于BERT的深度上下文嵌入模型能够有效提升低资源语言临床文本中的命名实体识别性能，为多语言临床NLP系统的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data
underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured
clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems,
including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects
assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized
language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named
entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity
of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this
gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to
enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ
MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different
monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text,
for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports
written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on
Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition
(SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian
Medications Recognition (IMR). These results outperform the mean and median F1
scores in the test leaderboard across all subtasks, with the mean/median values
being: 69.61%/75.66% for SDR, 81.22%/90.18% for SMR, 89.2%/88.96% for EMR, and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语翻译在机器翻译中是一个重大挑战，特别是对于乌尔都语等低资源语言，此前研究关注有限。需要推进该领域的研究。

Method: 创建了首个乌尔都语到英语习语翻译评估数据集，涵盖原生乌尔都语和罗马化乌尔都语脚本，并评估了多种开源LLM和NMT系统，使用BLEU、BERTScore、COMET和XCOMET等自动指标评估翻译质量。

Result: 提示工程相比直接翻译能提升习语翻译质量，但不同提示类型间的性能差异较小；跨脚本比较显示文本表示显著影响翻译质量，原生乌尔都语输入比罗马化乌尔都语产生更准确的习语翻译。

Conclusion: 该研究为乌尔都语习语翻译提供了首个评估基准，证明了提示工程的有效性和脚本表示对翻译质量的重要性，为低资源语言的习语翻译研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Idiomatic translation remains a significant challenge in machine translation,
especially for low resource languages such as Urdu, and has received limited
prior attention. To advance research in this area, we introduce the first
evaluation datasets for Urdu to English idiomatic translation, covering both
Native Urdu and Roman Urdu scripts and annotated with gold-standard English
equivalents. We evaluate multiple open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Neural Machine Translation (NMT) systems on this task, focusing on their
ability to preserve idiomatic and cultural meaning. Automatic metrics including
BLEU, BERTScore, COMET, and XCOMET are used to assess translation quality. Our
findings indicate that prompt engineering enhances idiomatic translation
compared to direct translation, though performance differences among prompt
types are relatively minor. Moreover, cross script comparisons reveal that text
representation substantially affects translation quality, with Native Urdu
inputs producing more accurate idiomatic translations than Roman Urdu.

Motivation: 将AI整合到医疗保健中时，公平获取可靠健康信息至关重要，但不同语言的信息质量存在差异，引发对多语言大语言模型可靠性和一致性的担忧。

Method: 构建多语言维基医疗数据集，分析跨语言医疗覆盖，评估LLM回答与参考的对齐度，并通过上下文信息和检索增强生成进行案例研究。

Result: 发现维基百科覆盖和LLM事实对齐存在显著跨语言差异，模型回答更偏向英语维基百科，但提供非英语上下文能有效转向文化相关知识。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了构建更公平的多语言医疗AI系统的可行路径。

Abstract: Equitable access to reliable health information is vital when integrating AI
into healthcare. Yet, information quality varies across languages, raising
concerns about the reliability and consistency of multilingual Large Language
Models (LLMs). We systematically examine cross-lingual disparities in
pre-training source and factuality alignment in LLM answers for multilingual
healthcare Q&A across English, German, Turkish, Chinese (Mandarin), and
Italian. We (i) constructed Multilingual Wiki Health Care
(MultiWikiHealthCare), a multilingual dataset from Wikipedia; (ii) analyzed
cross-lingual healthcare coverage; (iii) assessed LLM response alignment with
these references; and (iv) conducted a case study on factual alignment through
the use of contextual information and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our
findings reveal substantial cross-lingual disparities in both Wikipedia
coverage and LLM factual alignment. Across LLMs, responses align more with
English Wikipedia, even when the prompts are non-English. Providing contextual
excerpts from non-English Wikipedia at inference time effectively shifts
factual alignment toward culturally relevant knowledge. These results highlight
practical pathways for building more equitable, multilingual AI systems for
healthcare.

TL;DR: ReXMoE是一种新颖的混合专家架构，通过跨层重用专家来改进路由机制，在固定参数预算下提升模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构受限于层本地路由机制，需要在专家维度和路由多样性之间进行权衡，限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 提出ReXMoE架构，允许路由器在相邻层间重用专家，并采用渐进式缩放路由策略逐步增加候选专家池。

Result: 在0.5B到7B参数规模的不同架构上实验表明，ReXMoE在固定架构维度下持续提升语言建模和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: ReXMoE为参数高效且可扩展的MoE基础LLMs提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach
to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating
a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts
substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and
enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited
by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own
expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality
and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a
novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local
approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE
decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert
combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating
overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing
(PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training.
As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task
performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters
across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves
performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new
design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.

Motivation: 当前AI文本检测方法对AI-人类协作过程建模粗糙，主要采用二元分类或多分类，无法有效处理复杂协作过程产生的文本特征。

Method: 构建层次亲和树结构建模不同文本生成过程的关系，设计专门损失函数对齐文本表示，开发RealBench基准数据集包含各种人机协作文本。

Result: DETree在混合文本检测任务中性能提升，在分布外场景特别是小样本学习条件下显著增强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于训练的方法在OOD设置中具有潜力，层次亲和树结构能有效建模复杂文本生成过程的关系。

Abstract: Detecting AI-involved text is essential for combating misinformation,
plagiarism, and academic misconduct. However, AI text generation includes
diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans,
human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI),
where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these
varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant
challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely,
primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or
multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We
observe that representations of texts generated through different processes
exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a
novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a
Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss
function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this
learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that
automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through
various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in
hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and
generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot
learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based
approaches in OOD settings. Our code and dataset are available at

Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), LLM agents capable of
autonomous reasoning, planning, and executing complex tasks have become a
frontier in artificial intelligence. However, how to translate the research on
general agents into productivity that drives industry transformations remains a
significant challenge. To address this, this paper systematically reviews the
technologies, applications, and evaluation methods of industry agents based on
LLMs. Using an industry agent capability maturity framework, it outlines the
evolution of agents in industry applications, from "process execution systems"
to "adaptive social systems." First, we examine the three key technological
pillars that support the advancement of agent capabilities: Memory, Planning,
and Tool Use. We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple
tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and
collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of
the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital
engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative
business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper
reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and
specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation
systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally,
we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their
capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in
various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions. By
combining technological evolution with industry practices, this review aims to
clarify the current state and offer a clear roadmap and theoretical foundation
for understanding and building the next generation of industry agents.

### [265] [Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17498)
*Zihan Liu,Shun Zheng,Xumeng Wen,Yang Wang,Jiang Bian,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER) 通过概率化迭代推理框架，在验证和修正能力较弱的小型开源模型上显著扩展了推理能力，使模型能够渐进式接近正确答案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源小模型在长链推理任务中验证和修正能力薄弱，限制了其解决复杂问题的能力，需要一种能够克服这些限制的新方法。

Method: 将迭代推理建模为马尔可夫链，通过并行运行多个自演化过程来放大微小的改进概率，保证收敛到正确解。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B模型上，DSER在AIME 2024-2025基准测试中解决了5个之前无法解决的问题，整体性能提升，甚至超过了600B参数教师模型的单轮准确率。

Conclusion: DSER不仅提供了测试时扩展的有效方法，还揭示了当前开源推理模型在自验证、修正和稳定性方面的根本局限，为开发下一代具有强大自演化能力的模型指明了研究方向。

Abstract: Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced
reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement
frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems,
their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction
capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This
work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities
on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially
extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning
(DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step
represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is
that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability
of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple
long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small
positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct
answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On
the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously
unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model
to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through
majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER
framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight
reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification,
refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for
developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving
capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多语言句子嵌入学习方法，结合了单语和跨语言表示的最佳方法，显著减少了并行训练数据需求，在112种语言上实现了83.7%的双文本检索准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然BERT在单语句子嵌入学习方面很有效，但基于BERT的跨语言句子嵌入尚未被充分探索。

Method: 结合了掩码语言建模(MLM)、翻译语言建模(TLM)、双编码器翻译排序和加性边际softmax等最佳方法。

Result: 预训练多语言模型将所需并行训练数据减少80%；在Tatoeba的112种语言上达到83.7%的双文本检索准确率，显著优于LASER的65.5%；同时保持单语迁移学习的竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多语言句子嵌入学习方面取得了显著进展，并公开发布了支持109+语言的最佳模型。

Abstract: While BERT is an effective method for learning monolingual sentence
embeddings for semantic similarity and embedding based transfer learning BERT
based cross-lingual sentence embeddings have yet to be explored. We
systematically investigate methods for learning multilingual sentence
embeddings by combining the best methods for learning monolingual and
cross-lingual representations including: masked language modeling (MLM),
translation language modeling (TLM), dual encoder translation ranking, and
additive margin softmax. We show that introducing a pre-trained multilingual
language model dramatically reduces the amount of parallel training data
required to achieve good performance by 80%. Composing the best of these
methods produces a model that achieves 83.7% bi-text retrieval accuracy over
112 languages on Tatoeba, well above the 65.5 achieved by LASER, while still
performing competitively on monolingual transfer learning benchmarks. Parallel
data mined from CommonCrawl using our best model is shown to train competitive
NMT models for en-zh and en-de. We publicly release our best multilingual
sentence embedding model for 109+ languages at https://tfhub.dev/google/LaBSE.

*Shiyu Ni,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Minghao Tang,Jingtong Wu,Zengxin Han,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EliCal框架，通过两阶段方法实现LLM的诚实对齐：先用廉价的自一致性监督激发内部置信度，再用少量正确性标注进行校准，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有诚实对齐方法要么依赖无训练置信度估计，要么需要大规模正确性标注，成本高昂。需要开发标注高效的训练方法来实现通用诚实对齐。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用廉价的自一致性监督激发内部置信度；2) 用少量正确性标注校准置信度。同时发布了包含56万训练实例的HonestyBench基准。

Result: 仅用1000个正确性标注（全监督的0.18%）就实现了接近最优的对齐效果，在未见过的MMLU任务上表现优于仅校准基线。

Conclusion: EliCal为LLM的通用诚实对齐提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: Honesty alignment-the ability of large language models (LLMs) to recognize
their knowledge boundaries and express calibrated confidence-is essential for
trustworthy deployment. Existing methods either rely on training-free
confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or
training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective,
achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires
costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we
introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that
first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency
supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness
annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a
benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k
evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals.
Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k
correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment
performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a
scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.

*Tiancheng Hu,Joachim Baumann,Lorenzo Lupo,Dirk Hovy,Nigel Collier,Paul Röttger*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SimBench是首个大规模、标准化的LLM模拟人类行为基准测试，整合了20个多样化数据集，发现当前最佳LLM的模拟能力有限（40.80/100），性能随模型规模对数线性增长，指令微调在低熵问题上提升性能但在高熵问题上下降，模型在模拟特定人口群体时表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM模拟人类行为的评估方法零散且不可比较，需要统一的基准测试来推动LLM模拟能力的发展，确保其能真实反映人类行为。

Method: 开发SimBench基准测试，整合20个多样化数据集，涵盖道德决策、经济选择等任务，使用大规模全球参与者数据，系统评估LLM的模拟能力。

Result: 最佳LLM模拟得分仅40.80/100；性能随模型规模对数线性增长；推理时计算增加不提升性能；指令微调存在对齐-模拟权衡；模型在模拟特定人口群体时表现不佳；模拟能力与深度知识推理能力强相关（MMLU-Pro，r=0.939）。

Conclusion: SimBench为LLM模拟能力提供了可测量的进步标准，当前LLM模拟能力有限但可通过更大模型规模提升，需要开发更忠实的LLM模拟器，特别是在处理人口群体多样性和高熵问题方面。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) simulations of human behavior have the potential
to revolutionize the social and behavioral sciences, if and only if they
faithfully reflect real human behaviors. Current evaluations are fragmented,
based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable
results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale,
standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By
unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to
economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the
necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM
simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have
limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly
with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased
inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off:
instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions
but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle
when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that
simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive
reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to
accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的多任务学习框架，将自回归LLM与临床推理对齐，用于MSK-CHORD数据集上的癌症治疗结果预测，通过CoT提示和GRPO强化学习方法显著提升预测性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在生物医学NLP中表现良好，但缺乏对高风险决策支持至关重要的结构化推理能力，特别是在处理异质临床数据时。

Method: 使用三种对齐策略：标准监督微调、带思维链提示的监督微调、以及基于强化学习的组相对策略优化方法，联合执行二元生存分类、连续生存时间回归和自然语言理由生成。

Result: 实验显示思维链提示将F1提高6.0%，MAE降低12%，GRPO在BLEU、ROUGE和BERTScore上实现了最先进的可解释性和预测性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在多任务临床建模中推理感知对齐的重要性，为精准肿瘤学中可解释、可信赖的LLM设立了新基准。

Abstract: Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate
and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical
NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes
decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that
aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on
the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary
survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural
language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1)
standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs
to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and
Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and
reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and
predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that
existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to
architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of
reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new
benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.

*Nisrine Rair,Alban Goupil,Valeriu Vrabie,Emmanuel Chochoy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper来研究语言模型如何内部表示歧义，发现微调后的模型在嵌入空间中形成模块化、非凸的区域，即使在高歧义情况下也能保持高预测纯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量评估指标（如准确率）无法捕捉模型内部如何表示歧义，特别是当人类标注者存在分歧时。需要新的方法来理解模型如何处理主观性NLP任务中的不确定性。

Method: 使用拓扑数据分析工具Mapper分析RoBERTa-Large在MD-Offense数据集上的嵌入空间结构，与传统可视化工具（PCA、UMAP）进行对比。

Result: 微调将嵌入空间重组为模块化、非凸的区域，与模型预测对齐。超过98%的连接组件展现出≥90%的预测纯度，但在歧义数据中与真实标签的对齐度下降，揭示了结构置信度与标签不确定性之间的隐藏张力。

Conclusion: Mapper是一个强大的诊断工具，能够揭示模型如何解决歧义，并提供了拓扑度量指标，可为主观NLP任务中的主动建模策略提供信息。

Abstract: Language models are often evaluated with scalar metrics like accuracy, but
such measures fail to capture how models internally represent ambiguity,
especially when human annotators disagree. We propose a topological perspective
to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances.
  Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from
topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding
space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for
highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\%$ of connected components exhibit $\geq 90\%$
prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous
data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label
uncertainty.
  Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry
directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident
clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for
understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also
enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in
subjective NLP tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的语言混淆门（LCG）方法，通过解码时过滤token来解决LLM的语言混淆问题，无需重新训练模型，且能区分有害混淆和可接受的语码转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前解决语言混淆的方法要么需要模型重新训练，要么无法区分有害的混淆和可接受的语码转换，因此需要一种更轻量且智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用规范调整的自蒸馏训练LCG，预测适当的语言家族，仅在需要时应用掩码。基于语言混淆不频繁、正确语言token通常位于预测前列、高资源语言输出token嵌入规范更大的发现。

Result: 在包括Qwen3、GPT-OSS、Gemma3、Llama3.1在内的各种模型上评估，LCG显著减少了语言混淆，通常降低一个数量级，且不影响任务性能。

Conclusion: LCG是一种有效的轻量级插件解决方案，能显著减少语言混淆，同时保持任务性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often experience language confusion, which is
the unintended mixing of languages during text generation. Current solutions to
this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate
between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces
the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters
tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using
norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and
apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that
language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the
top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource
languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models,
including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion
significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting
task performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有预训练语言模型在代码任务中表现良好，但未考虑代码内部潜在的高阶数据关联，限制了性能提升

Method: 设计token和超边生成器捕获三种高阶关联，改进超图神经网络架构并结合适配器调优，提出HGAdapter方法

Result: 在多个公开数据集（6种语言的代码摘要和克隆检测任务）上不同程度提升了PLM性能

Conclusion: 引入高阶数据关联有助于提高模型效果，HGAdapter可插入各种PLM中增强性能

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to
code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take
into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose
three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax
tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a
tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations.
We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with
adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to
fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is
allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments
were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code
summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the
performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results
validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to
improved effectiveness.

Conclusion: 显式建模法律推理链对于增强语言模型推理能力具有重要价值，LawChain框架在提升法律推理性能方面表现出良好的效果和泛化能力。

Abstract: Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and
decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning
predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC,
which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal
reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases,
with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel
framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese
tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes
used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module
reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained
sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort
legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to
systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for
tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large
language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our
results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling
crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several
baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning
through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on
additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and
Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these
baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in
tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis
tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning
chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.

Motivation: 现有遗忘学习方法评估只关注目标知识的遗忘程度和保留集性能，但忽视了用户可能希望在提示中重新引入已删除知识时模型仍能利用它的重要使用场景。

Method: 在现有遗忘学习目标基础上增加一个插件项，专门保护模型在上下文提示中包含遗忘知识时使用该知识的能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能将上下文效用恢复到接近原始水平，同时保持有效的遗忘效果和保留集效用。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在遗忘学习中考虑上下文效用的重要性，提出的方法能有效解决现有遗忘学习方法损害模型使用上下文知识能力的问题。

Abstract: Large language models may encode sensitive information or outdated knowledge
that needs to be removed, to ensure responsible and compliant model responses.
Unlearning has emerged as an efficient alternative to full retraining, aiming
to remove specific knowledge while preserving overall model utility. Existing
evaluations of unlearning methods focus on (1) the extent of forgetting of the
target knowledge (forget set) and (2) maintaining performance on the retain set
(i.e., utility). However, these evaluations overlook an important usability
aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if
it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six
state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such
contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a
plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when
it is present in context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
restores contextual utility to near original levels while still maintaining
effective forgetting and retain-set utility.

Abstract: Large Language Models have achieved strong performance on reasoning tasks,
solving competition-level coding and math problems. However, their scalability
is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging
coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only
thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation
methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting
challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST,
a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and
difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized
generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators
demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging
problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate
large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong
teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning
for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation
experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after
fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we
surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an
additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple
synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger
DeepSeek-R1-671B. These findings indicate that generating complex problems via
QueST offers an effective and scalable approach to advancing the frontiers of
competitive coding and reasoning for large language models.

*Nanda Kumar Rengarajan,Jun Yan,Chun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出轻量级少样本NER框架，通过新指令调优模板和保留实体信息的数据增强技术，在低资源场景下实现与最先进模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源场景下NER任务标注数据稀缺的问题，现有零样本和指令调优方法在领域特定实体上泛化能力不足且未能有效利用有限数据。

Method: 1) 新指令调优模板简化输出格式，利用先进LLM的大上下文窗口；2) 战略数据增强技术保留实体信息同时改写上下文，扩展训练数据而不损害语义关系。

Result: 在基准数据集上，少样本方法在CrossNER数据集上平均F1得分为80.1，数据增强版本比基线版本F1分数提升高达17分。

Conclusion: 为拥有有限NER训练数据和计算资源的群体提供了有前景的解决方案，在少样本和零样本任务上达到与最先进模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a critical task that requires substantial
annotated data, making it challenging in low-resource scenarios where label
acquisition is expensive. While zero-shot and instruction-tuned approaches have
made progress, they often fail to generalize to domain-specific entities and do
not effectively utilize limited available data. We present a lightweight
few-shot NER framework that addresses these challenges through two key
innovations: (1) a new instruction tuning template with a simplified output
format that combines principles from prior IT approaches to leverage the large
context window of recent state-of-the-art LLMs; (2) introducing a strategic
data augmentation technique that preserves entity information while
paraphrasing the surrounding context, thereby expanding our training data
without compromising semantic relationships. Experiments on benchmark datasets
show that our method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art models
on few-shot and zero-shot tasks, with our few-shot approach attaining an
average F1 score of 80.1 on the CrossNER datasets. Models trained with our
paraphrasing approach show consistent improvements in F1 scores of up to 17
points over baseline versions, offering a promising solution for groups with
limited NER training data and compute power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了AcademicEval，一个用于评估LLM在长上下文生成任务上的实时基准，使用arXiv论文构建学术写作任务，无需人工标注，确保无标签泄露。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长上下文LLM基准存在上下文长度固定、标注劳动密集以及LLM训练中标签泄露的问题，需要一个新的评估框架。

Method: 采用arXiv论文构建学术写作任务（标题、摘要、引言、相关工作），集成高质量专家策划的少样本演示，支持灵活上下文长度，实现高效实时评估。

Result: LLM在具有层次抽象级别的任务上表现不佳，且难以处理长少样本演示，突显了基准的挑战性。

Conclusion: AcademicEval为评估LLM的长上下文建模能力提供了有效基准，并揭示了增强LLM能力的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable performance in
long-context understanding. However, current long-context LLM benchmarks are
limited by rigid context length, labor-intensive annotation, and the pressing
challenge of label leakage issues during LLM training. Therefore, we propose
\textsc{AcademicEval}, a live benchmark for evaluating LLMs over long-context
generation tasks. \textsc{AcademicEval} adopts papers on arXiv to introduce
several academic writing tasks with long-context inputs, \textit{i.e.},
\textsc{Title}, \textsc{Abstract}, \textsc{Introduction}, and \textsc{Related
Work}, which cover a wide range of abstraction levels and require no manual
labeling. Moreover, \textsc{AcademicEval} integrates high-quality and
expert-curated few-shot demonstrations from a collected co-author graph to
enable flexible context length. Especially, \textsc{AcademicEval} features an
efficient live evaluation, ensuring no label leakage. We conduct a holistic
evaluation on \textsc{AcademicEval}, and the results illustrate that LLMs
perform poorly on tasks with hierarchical abstraction levels and tend to
struggle with long few-shot demonstrations, highlighting the challenge of our
benchmark. Through experimental analysis, we also reveal some insights for
enhancing LLMs' long-context modeling capabilities. Code is available at

*Tong Chen,Akari Asai,Luke Zettlemoyer,Hannaneh Hajishirzi,Faeze Brahman*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习方法，有效减少语言模型的外部幻觉，在保持其他任务性能的同时显著提升事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型经常生成训练数据不支持的事实错误信息（外部幻觉），现有缓解方法往往会影响开放生成和下游任务性能，限制了实际应用价值。

Method: 使用二元检索增强奖励的在线强化学习方法，只有当模型输出完全正确时才给予奖励1，否则为0，相比连续奖励方案更有效。

Result: 在开放生成任务中幻觉率降低39.3%；在短问答任务中学会校准弃权，在PopQA和GPQA上错误答案分别减少44.4%和21.7%；且不影响指令遵循、数学和代码能力。

Conclusion: 二元奖励强化学习能有效解决事实准确性与任务性能之间的权衡问题，而连续奖励RL虽然也能改善事实性，但会导致质量下降。

Abstract: Language models often generate factually incorrect information unsupported by
their training data, a phenomenon known as extrinsic hallucination. Existing
mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and
downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online
reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward
(RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach
assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually
correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models
across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3%
reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised
training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering,
the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting "I don't know"
when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7%
fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these
factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following,
math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality,
induces quality regressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗大语言模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，但这些结果向临床工作流程中安全可靠性能的转移仍面临挑战，需要更系统化的评估框架。

Method: 采用自主性级别框架(L0-L3)：信息工具、信息转换与聚合、决策支持、监督代理，将现有基准和指标与各层级的允许操作和风险对齐。

Result: 提出了基于层级的评估蓝图，包括指标选择、证据收集和声明报告的方法，以及将评估与监管联系的方向。

Conclusion: 通过以自主性为中心，该调查推动领域超越基于分数的声明，转向为真实临床使用提供可信、风险感知的证据。

Abstract: Medical Large language models achieve strong scores on standard benchmarks;
however, the transfer of those results to safe and reliable performance in
clinical workflows remains a challenge. This survey reframes evaluation through
a levels-of-autonomy lens (L0-L3), spanning informational tools, information
transformation and aggregation, decision support, and supervised agents. We
align existing benchmarks and metrics with the actions permitted at each level
and their associated risks, making the evaluation targets explicit. This
motivates a level-conditioned blueprint for selecting metrics, assembling
evidence, and reporting claims, alongside directions that link evaluation to
oversight. By centering autonomy, the survey moves the field beyond score-based
claims toward credible, risk-aware evidence for real clinical use.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了FARE（基础自动推理评估器），通过大规模数据（250万样本）和简单迭代拒绝采样SFT方法训练评估器，在多个评估任务中超越更大规模的专用评估器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式评估器主要关注新方法（如强化学习），而忽视大规模数据驱动开发。本文专注于数据扩展，以解决训练和测试时对可扩展评估的需求。

Method: 收集250万样本覆盖5种评估任务，使用简单的迭代拒绝采样监督微调方法训练8B和20B参数的FARE评估器。

Result: FARE-8B挑战更大的专用RL训练评估器，FARE-20B在开源评估器中创下新标准，超越专用70B+评估器。在推理时重排序、RL训练验证等实际任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 大规模数据驱动的简单SFT方法可以训练出强大的评估器，FARE在多个评估任务中表现出色，为实际应用提供了有效的评估解决方案。

Abstract: Finetuning specialized generative evaluators has emerged as a popular
paradigm to meet the increasing demand for scalable evaluation during both
training and test-time. However, recent work has largely focused on applying
new methodology, such as reinforcement learning (RL), to training evaluators,
shying away from large-scale, data-driven development. In this work, we focus
on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation
tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification,
and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With
our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family
of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative
rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges
larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for
open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static
benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers,
FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training,
FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs.
string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned
FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.

Method: 提出可执行知识图谱(xKG)，这是一个模块化和可插拔的知识库，自动从科学文献中提取技术洞察、代码片段和领域特定知识。

Result: 在三个代理框架和两种不同LLM上集成xKG后，在PaperBench上显示出显著的性能提升(使用o3-mini时提升10.9%)。

Conclusion: xKG被证明是自动化AI研究复现的通用且可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Replicating AI research is a crucial yet challenging task for large language
model (LLM) agents. Existing approaches often struggle to generate executable
code, primarily due to insufficient background knowledge and the limitations of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods, which fail to capture latent
technical details hidden in referenced papers. Furthermore, previous approaches
tend to overlook valuable implementation-level code signals and lack structured
knowledge representations that support multi-granular retrieval and reuse. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a
modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical
insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from
scientific literature. When integrated into three agent frameworks with two
different LLMs, xKG shows substantial performance gains (10.9% with o3-mini) on
PaperBench, demonstrating its effectiveness as a general and extensible
solution for automated AI research replication. Code will released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户草图难以直接表达连续的流动变化和旋转细节，需要中间表示来捕捉这些信息

Method: 两阶段框架：草图指导流函数生成，流函数作为速度场生成器的控制条件，使用流线编码全局流动动力学作为训练时的草图指导

Result: 生成的流函数能够捕捉草图中缺失的连续变化和旋转流动细节，生成的速度场可以指导烟雾模拟与预期流动对齐

Conclusion: 流函数作为中间表示有效连接用户草图与烟雾模拟，实现了草图驱动的烟雾插图生成

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a two-stage sketch-based smoke illustration
generation framework using stream function and latent diffusion models (LDM).
The user sketch is used to guide the generation of the stream function, which
serves as the control condition for the velocity field generator. The generated
velocity field can be used to guide the smoke simulation to align with the
intended flow. We adopt streamlines to encode global flow dynamics as sketch
guidance during training. The stream function constitutes the intermediate
representation that captures continuous variation and rotational flow details
absent from sketches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将运动融入静态图像能增强视觉表现力和沉浸感，但流体元素（如瀑布、河流、海洋）的复杂动态特性在建模和控制方面存在挑战，现有方法难以生成平滑且时间一致的流体运动

Method: 使用微调的条件潜在扩散模型从用户提供的草图生成运动场，通过运动适配器将其集成到潜在视频扩散模型中，精确控制流体运动

Result: 该框架能够生成具有平滑和时间一致流体运动的景观视频

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了静态图像中流体动画的挑战，通过运动草图引导实现了对流体运动的精确控制

Abstract: Integrating motion into static images not only enhances visual expressiveness
but also creates a sense of immersion and temporal depth, establishing it as a
longstanding and impactful theme in artistic expression. Fluid elements such as
waterfall, river, and oceans are common features in landscape, but their
complex dynamic characteristics pose significant challenges in modeling and
controlling their motion within visual computing. Physics-based methods are
often used in fluid animation to track particle movement. However, they are
easily affected by boundary conditions. Recently, latent diffusion models have
been applied to video generation tasks, demonstrating impressive capabilities
in producing high-quality and temporally coherent results. However, it is
challenging for the existing methods to animate fluid smooth and temporally
consistent motion. To solve these issues, this paper introduces a framework for
generating landscape videos by animating fluid in still images under the
guidance of motion sketches. We propose a finetuned conditional latent
diffusion model for generating motion field from user-provided sketches, which
are subsequently integrated into a latent video diffusion model via a motion
adapter to precisely control the fluid movement.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应无帧渲染方法，通过闭环反馈采样和GPU重建，在保持视觉质量的同时显著减少所需采样数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交互式渲染方法存在刚性采样模式限制，无法根据时空颜色变化进行细粒度自适应采样，限制了渲染效率

Method: 使用闭环反馈引导采样朝向图像边缘或运动区域，结合时间深度缓冲区存储样本，GPU重建响应采样密度和时空颜色梯度

Result: 模拟显示无帧渲染器比传统渲染方法减少一个数量级的采样数量，同时仅增加15%的计算时间开销

Conclusion: 自适应无帧渲染方法能够显著提高渲染速度，在静态场景中产生更锐利图像，在动态场景中保持图像及时更新

Abstract: We propose an adaptive form of frameless rendering with the potential to
dramatically increase rendering speed over conventional interactive rendering
approaches. Without the rigid sampling patterns of framed renderers, sampling
and reconstruction can adapt with very fine granularity to spatio-temporal
color change. A sampler uses closed-loop feedback to guide sampling toward
edges or motion in the image. Temporally deep buffers store all the samples
created over a short time interval for use in reconstruction and as sampler
feedback. GPU-based reconstruction responds both to sampling density and
space-time color gradients. Where the displayed scene is static, spatial color
change dominates and older samples are given significant weight in
reconstruction, resulting in sharper and eventually antialiased images. Where
the scene is dynamic, more recent samples are emphasized, resulting in less
sharp but more up-to-date images. We also use sample reprojection to improve
reconstruction and guide sampling toward occlusion edges, undersampled regions,
and specular highlights. In simulation our frameless renderer requires an order
of magnitude fewer samples than traditional rendering of similar visual quality
(as measured by RMS error), while introducing overhead amounting to 15% of
computation time.

Motivation: 传统骨架化方法通常假设体积解释，而该方法直接在表面上操作，确保结果表示对导航感知的几何分析保持相关性。

Result: 在程序内容生成和自动关卡分析两个用例中验证了该方法，能够产生简化的、连贯的表示。

Conclusion: 该方法支持程序生成、空间推理和地图分析等应用，能够从3D多边形数据中提取有效的层次结构表示。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method to extract a hierarchical tree representation
from 3D unorganized polygonal data. The proposed approach first extracts a
graph representation of the surface, which serves as the foundation for
structural analysis. A Steiner tree is then generated to establish an optimized
connection between key terminal points, defined according to
application-specific criteria. The structure can be further refined by
leveraging line-of-sight constraints, reducing redundancy while preserving
essential connectivity. Unlike traditional skeletonization techniques, which
often assume volumetric interpretations, this method operates directly on the
surface, ensuring that the resulting representation remains relevant for
navigation-aware geometric analysis. The method is validated through two use
cases: extracting structural representations from tile-based elements for
procedural content generation, and identifying key points and structural
metrics for automated level analysis. Results demonstrate its ability to
produce simplified, coherent representations, supporting applications in
procedural generation, spatial reasoning, and map analysis.

Conclusion: 指令式方法比声明式方法更简单且能处理更复杂多样的场景，错误修正机制提高了鲁棒性，人类评估显示明显偏好指令式方法。

Abstract: Synthesizing 3D scenes from open-vocabulary text descriptions is a
challenging, important, and recently-popular application. One of its critical
subproblems is layout generation: given a set of objects, lay them out to
produce a scene matching the input description. Nearly all recent work adopts a
declarative paradigm for this problem: using an LLM to generate a specification
of constraints between objects, then solving those constraints to produce the
final layout. In contrast, we explore an alternative imperative paradigm, in
which an LLM iteratively places objects, with each object's position and
orientation computed as a function of previously-placed objects. The imperative
approach allows for a simpler scene specification language while also handling
a wider variety and larger complexity of scenes. We further improve the
robustness of our imperative scheme by developing an error correction mechanism
that iteratively improves the scene's validity while staying as close as
possible to the original layout generated by the LLM. In forced-choice
perceptual studies, participants preferred layouts generated by our imperative
approach 82% and 94% of the time when compared against two declarative layout
generation methods. We also present a simple, automated evaluation metric for
3D scene layout generation that aligns well with human preferences.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对持久性图和合并树的广义Wasserstein距离，通过利用拓扑特征在输入域中的区域信息，提供了比经典Wasserstein距离更具区分性的度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Wasserstein距离在比较拓扑特征时没有充分利用特征在输入域中的区域信息，需要一种更精细的度量来更好地捕捉拓扑特征的差异。

Method: 重新定义拓扑特征比较为极值对齐区域值之间的距离，通过输入参数调整区域属性在距离中的影响，并提供子集计算和区域属性压缩两种策略来控制计算时间和内存使用。

Result: 在公开可用的集成数据上进行广泛实验，平均运行时间在分钟级别，能够有效跟踪拓扑特征的演化并检测集成中的关键阶段。

Conclusion: 提出的广义Wasserstein距离比经典方法更具区分性，支持拓扑特征跟踪和集成可视化，提供了实用的C++实现。

Abstract: This paper presents a generalization of the Wasserstein distance for both
persistence diagrams and merge trees [20], [66] that takes advantage of the
regions of their topological features in the input domain. Specifically, we
redefine the comparison of topological features as a distance between the
values of their extrema-aligned regions. It results in a more discriminative
metric than the classical Wasserstein distance and generalizes it through an
input parameter adjusting the impact of the region properties in the distance.
We present two strategies to control both computation time and memory storage
of our method by respectively enabling the use of subsets of the regions in the
computation, and by compressing the regions' properties to obtain low-memory
representations. Extensive experiments on openly available ensemble data
demonstrate the efficiency of our method, with running times on the orders of
minutes on average. We show the utility of our contributions with two
applications. First, we use the assignments between topological features
provided by our method to track their evolution in time-varying ensembles and
propose the temporal persistence curves to facilitate the understanding of how
these features appear, disappear and change over time. Second, our method
allows to compute a distance matrix of an ensemble that can be used for
dimensionality reduction purposes and visually represent in 2D all its members,
we show that such distance matrices also allow to detect key phases in the
ensemble. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to
reproduce our results.

Conclusion: 简单的预滤波是一种有效的技术，可以改善等值面可视化质量，去除干扰性的微小组件。

Abstract: Let $f: \mathbb{R}^3 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a scalar field. An isosurface
is a piecewise linear approximation of a level set $f^{-1}(\sigma)$ for some
$\sigma \in \mathbb{R}$ built from some regular grid sampling of $f$.
Isosurfaces constructed from scanned data such as CT scans or MRIs often
contain extremely small components that distract from the visualization and do
not form part of any geometric model produced from the data. Simple
prefiltering of the data can remove such small components while having no
effect on the large components that form the body of the visualization. We
present experimental results on such filtering.

*Paascal Grosset,James Ahrens*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SeerX是一个轻量级、可扩展的传输中(in-transit)原位服务，支持动态资源分配和3D模拟数据的有损压缩，允许多个模拟将分析任务卸载到共享的弹性服务基础设施中，无需MPI同步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模拟产生的数据超过超级计算机的磁盘空间，许多模拟采用原位分析和可视化来减少需要存储的数据量。但原位可视化的效果受到先验知识需求的限制：需要知道可视化参数来突出感兴趣的特征，以及提前知道运行原位工作流所需的资源量。

Method: 提出SeerX服务，这是一个轻量级、可扩展的传输中原位服务，支持动态资源分配和3D模拟数据的有损压缩。SeerX允许多个模拟将分析任务卸载到共享的弹性服务基础设施中，无需MPI同步。

Result: SeerX解决了原位可视化中的两个关键挑战：可视化参数选择和资源需求预测，通过动态资源分配和共享服务基础设施提高了原位分析的效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SeerX为大规模模拟提供了一种有效的原位分析解决方案，通过弹性服务基础设施和动态资源管理，克服了传统原位方法对先验知识的依赖，实现了更高效的数据处理和可视化。

Abstract: As simulations produce more data than available disk space on supercomputers,
many simulations are employing in situ analysis and visualization to reduce the
amount of data that needs to be stored. While in situ visualization offers
potential for substantial data reduction, its efficacy is hindered by the need
for a priori knowledge. First, we need to know what visualization parameters to
use to highlight features of interest. Second, we do not know ahead of time how
much resources will be needed to run the in situ workflows, e.g. how many
compute nodes will be needed for in situ work. In this work, we present SeerX,
a lightweight, scalable in-transit in situ service that supports dynamic
resource allocation and lossy compression of 3D simulation data. SeerX enables
multiple simulations to offload analysis to a shared, elastic service
infrastructure without MPI synchronization.

*Lu Yin,Ziying Shi,Yinghao Wu,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu,Shihui Guo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SAIP是首个考虑身体形状差异的稀疏惯性运动捕捉方法，通过分解与形状和姿态相关的传感器测量，能够有效处理不同体型（如儿童）的运动捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖标准成人身体形状模板，难以泛化到体型差异较大的个体（如儿童），主要由于身体形状变化导致的IMU加速度测量差异。

Method: 1. 训练回归模型将真实身体的IMU加速度转换到匹配模板成人身体模型；2. 使用现有方法估计模板形状身体的全身运动；3. 使用第二个回归模型将关节速度映射回真实身体，并结合形状感知物理优化策略计算全局运动。

Result: SAIP能有效处理不同体型的运动捕捉任务，并提出了首个惯性形状估计方案。创建了包含10名儿童和10名成人、总计400分钟的IMU-运动配对数据集。

Conclusion: SAIP通过形状感知方法解决了惯性运动捕捉中的体型泛化问题，为不同体型个体的运动捕捉提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Human motion capture with sparse inertial sensors has gained significant
attention recently. However, existing methods almost exclusively rely on a
template adult body shape to model the training data, which poses challenges
when generalizing to individuals with largely different body shapes (such as a
child). This is primarily due to the variation in IMU-measured acceleration
caused by changes in body shape. To fill this gap, we propose Shape-aware
Inertial Poser (SAIP), the first solution considering body shape differences in
sparse inertial-based motion capture. Specifically, we decompose the sensor
measurements related to shape and pose in order to effectively model their
joint correlations. Firstly, we train a regression model to transfer the
IMU-measured accelerations of a real body to match the template adult body
model, compensating for the shape-related sensor measurements. Then, we can
easily follow the state-of-the-art methods to estimate the full body motions of
the template-shaped body. Finally, we utilize a second regression model to map
the joint velocities back to the real body, combined with a shape-aware
physical optimization strategy to calculate global motions on the subject.
Furthermore, our method relies on body shape awareness, introducing the first
inertial shape estimation scheme. This is accomplished by modeling the
shape-conditioned IMU-pose correlation using an MLP-based network. To validate
the effectiveness of SAIP, we also present the first IMU motion capture dataset
containing individuals of different body sizes. This dataset features 10
children and 10 adults, with heights ranging from 110 cm to 190 cm, and a total
of 400 minutes of paired IMU-Motion samples. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that SAIP can effectively handle motion capture tasks for diverse
body shapes. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: VisuoAlign是一个通过提示引导树搜索实现多模态安全对齐的框架，旨在解决大型视觉语言模型的安全对齐挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法对多模态越狱攻击脆弱，因为视觉输入引入了新的攻击面，推理链缺乏安全监督，且模态融合时对齐效果会退化。

Method: 通过视觉-文本交互提示将安全约束嵌入推理过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索构建多样化的安全关键提示轨迹，并引入基于提示的缩放实现实时风险检测和合规响应。

Result: 实验表明VisuoAlign能主动暴露风险，实现全面的数据集生成，并显著提高LVLMs对复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign框架有效解决了多模态安全对齐的关键挑战，提升了大型视觉语言模型的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

### [296] [Executable Epistemology: The Structured Cognitive Loop as an Architecture of Intentional Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15952)
*Myung Ho Kim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了结构化认知循环(SCL)作为可执行的认知框架，旨在解决大语言模型缺乏真正认知架构的问题。SCL将哲学洞见转化为可计算结构，通过功能分离的认知架构产生更连贯和可解释的行为，并将智能重新定义为通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型表现出智能但缺乏真正的认知理解，暴露了认知架构的缺失。传统AI研究关注"什么是智能"的本体论问题，而SCL关注"在什么条件下认知涌现"的认识论问题。

Method: 基于心智哲学和认知现象学，结合过程哲学、具身认知和扩展心智理论，将智能定义为执行过程——判断、记忆、控制、行动和调节的连续循环。通过功能分离的认知架构实现可执行的认知论。

Result: SCL将哲学洞见转化为可计算结构，支持"可执行认知论"；功能分离的认知架构比单一提示系统产生更连贯和可解释的行为；重新定义智能为通过意向性理解重建自身认知状态的能力。

Conclusion: SCL框架对心智哲学、认知论和AI产生重要影响：允许认知理论被实施和测试；将行为建立在认知结构而非统计规律上；将知识框定为在现象学连贯循环中的持续重建过程。真正的进步需要实现认知原则的结构化架构，而非更大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential

TL;DR: PISA是一个受皮亚杰认知发展理论启发的统一记忆系统，通过三模态适应机制和混合记忆访问架构，提升了AI代理的适应性和长期知识保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理记忆系统缺乏对多样化任务的适应性，忽视了记忆的建构性和任务导向作用，需要更灵活、自适应的记忆架构。

Method: 提出PISA系统，包含三模态适应机制（图式更新、图式演化和图式创建）和混合记忆访问架构，结合符号推理与神经检索。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准和新提出的AggQA数据分析基准上，PISA实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了适应性和长期知识保留。

Conclusion: PISA通过建构性记忆方法和自适应机制，为AI代理提供了更灵活、高效的记忆系统，推动了记忆系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

TL;DR: 研究表明，大型推理模型在解决超越特定困惑度阈值的谜题时会出现性能崩溃，即使提供环境接口让模型跟踪状态空间也无法延迟或消除这种崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型推理模型在解决复杂谜题时性能崩溃的真正原因，特别是验证是否需要模型自行跟踪状态空间这一潜在混淆因素。

Method: 为大型语言模型提供汉诺塔问题的环境接口，允许模型通过工具调用进行移动、提供书面理由、观察结果状态空间并重新提示下一步移动。

Result: 环境接口的访问无法延迟或消除性能崩溃，策略分析显示模型与最优策略和均匀随机策略的差异越来越大，表明在每个复杂度级别都出现模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型的性能崩溃现象可能源于模式崩溃，性能取决于模式是否反映问题的正确解决方案。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Load Traces (CLTs)作为深度模型的中层可解释性框架，通过量化模型内部资源分配来分析和干预推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知负荷理论启发，旨在为深度模型提供可解释的认知负荷分析框架，揭示模型推理过程中的资源分配模式。

Method: 将CLTs定义为三组分随机过程(IL_t, EL_t, GL_t)，分别对应内在、外在和相关负荷，通过注意力熵、KV缓存缺失率、表征分散度和解码稳定性等可测量代理进行实例化。

Result: 在推理和规划基准测试中，CLTs能够预测错误发生、揭示认知策略，并通过负荷引导的干预将推理效率提高15-30%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: CLTs框架为深度模型提供了有效的认知负荷分析和干预工具，显著提升了推理效率并保持了模型性能。

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动形式化方法在保持语义含义和逻辑结构方面的不足，将结构保真度作为主要目标。

Method: 首先构建有向无环图来映射证明步骤间的逻辑依赖关系，然后采用基于引理的方法系统地将每个步骤形式化为中间引理，保持原始论证的逻辑结构。

Result: 在包含184个本科水平问题的新基准测试中，ProofFlow实现了0.545的ProofScore，显著超过了完整证明形式化(0.123)和步骤证明形式化(0.072)等基线方法。

Conclusion: ProofFlow流水线、基准测试和评分指标的开源将推动自动形式化领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于随机置换集(RPS)的冲突度量方法，从随机有限集和Dempster-Shafer理论两个角度分析置换间的冲突，并引入基于秩偏重叠的度量方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机置换集作为处理包含顺序信息的不确定性的新形式化方法，需要有效度量由置换质量函数表示的两个证据之间的冲突，这是顺序结构不确定信息融合的迫切研究课题。

Method: 从置换观察出发，基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义置换间的不一致性度量，提出非重叠基础的RPS冲突度量方法，将RPS理论视为DST的扩展。

Result: 通过数值示例展示了所提冲突度量的行为和特性，该方法具有自然的顶部加权特性，能从DST视角有效度量RPS间的冲突。

Conclusion: 所提方法不仅具有顶部加权特性，能有效度量RPS间的冲突，还为决策者提供了权重、参数和截断深度的灵活选择。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移故障诊断方法通常假设数据干净或领域相似性足够，但在工业环境中严重噪声干扰和领域偏移同时存在，限制了这些方法的有效性

Method: 基于信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进的正交损失来解耦领域不变的故障表示；采用全局-局部领域对抗方案约束模型的联合分布和边际分布

Result: 在三个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他现有方法

Conclusion: ISGFAN框架在噪声条件下的跨领域故障诊断中表现出优越性

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

*Dou Liu,Ying Long,Sophia Zuoqiu,Di Liu,Kang Li,Yiting Lin,Hanyi Liu,Rong Yin,Tian Tang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型生成临床思维链的可靠性，发现选择性少样本提示策略能显著提升质量，而随机少样本策略与零样本相比无显著改进。AI评估器无法识别这些关键差异，凸显了人类专家在临床AI评估中的不可替代作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量临床思维链数据稀缺问题，验证LLM生成医疗数据的可靠性，并探索提升其质量的提示策略。

Method: 采用盲法比较研究，由辅助生殖技术领域资深临床医生评估三种提示策略生成的思维链：零样本、随机少样本（使用浅层示例）和选择性少样本（使用多样化高质量示例）。同时与GPT-4o的评估结果进行对比。

Result: 选择性少样本策略在所有人类评估指标上均显著优于其他策略（p < .001）。随机少样本策略相比零样本基线无显著改进，表明低质量示例与无示例同样无效。AI评估器未能识别这些关键性能差异。

Conclusion: 合成临床思维链的可靠性取决于策略性提示策划，而非仅仅提供示例。提出了'双原则'框架作为生成可信数据的基础方法，证实了人类专业知识在高风险临床AI评估中的不可或缺作用。

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI在企业决策中的中介作用日益增强，传统的基于人类代理人归因的企业犯罪意图假设面临挑战，需要重新定义企业知识的概念以适应算法时代。

Method: 基于扩展认知理论，开发了一个形式化模型来捕捉部署复杂AI或信息系统企业的认知状态，引入连续的组织知识度量S_S(φ)，整合管道的计算成本和统计验证的错误率。

Result: 推导出阈值知识谓词K_S来归因知识，以及企业范围认知能力指数K_{S,t}来衡量整体能力，并将这些定量指标映射到实际知识、推定知识、故意忽视和鲁莽的法律标准上。

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建可衡量和可裁决的审计工件提供了途径，使企业思维在算法时代变得可追踪和可问责。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PHI去识别对于临床笔记的安全重用至关重要，但传统评估依赖成本高昂的小规模专家标注，限制了模型比较和选择。

Method: 部署多个评估智能体独立判断PHI提取正确性，通过LLM多数投票机制整合不同评估者观点，生成稳定可复现的模型排名。

Result: 在真实临床笔记语料上的实验表明，TEAM-PHI能产生一致准确的排名，尽管个体评估者存在差异，但LLM投票能可靠收敛到相同的最佳系统。

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI通过结合独立评估智能体和LLM多数投票，为PHI去识别提供了实用、安全且成本效益高的自动评估和最佳模型选择方案。

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

TL;DR: 论文提出了"被记住权"概念，旨在解决LLMs可能导致的信息偏见和遗漏问题，保护数字存在有限的群体不被AI驱动的信息遗忘所影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的广泛应用，人们开始依赖它们进行信息检索。但LLMs将多个观点合成为单一权威性回答，可能放大偏见和遗漏效应，使某些叙事、个体或群体被不成比例地压制，而其他则被过度放大，威胁集体记忆的完整性。

Method: 提出"被记住权"概念框架，该框架包含三个核心要素：最小化AI驱动信息遗漏风险、保障公平对待权利、确保生成内容最大程度真实。

Result: 通过建立"被记住权"概念，为应对LLMs对信息生态和集体记忆的潜在威胁提供了理论框架和解决方案方向。

Conclusion: "被记住权"是应对LLMs信息偏见和遗漏的重要概念，需要在AI发展中平衡信息集中与多样性保护，确保数字时代的信息公平和记忆完整性。

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Result: 在ScholarIdeas专家标注数据集上，ScholarEval比所有基线方法显著覆盖更多专家标注要点，且在可操作性、深度和证据支持方面持续优于OpenAI的o4-mini-deep-research系统。大规模用户研究显示在文献参与、想法精炼和实用性方面显著优于深度研究。

Conclusion: ScholarEval为AI生成研究想法的评估提供了有效框架，公开代码、数据集和工具供社区使用和发展。

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our
large-scale user study also shows that ScholarEval significantly outperforms
deep research in literature engagement, idea refinement, and usefulness. We
openly release our code, dataset, and ScholarEval tool for the community to use
and build on.

Motivation: 识别和分析大型推理模型在复杂推理任务中的关键漏洞——推理分心，即模型容易被恶意嵌入的无关复杂任务干扰而偏离主要目标。

Method: 通过跨模型和基准的综合研究，分析推理分心的脆弱性；提出基于监督微调和强化学习的训练防御方法，使用合成对抗数据进行训练。

Result: 最先进的LRM高度易受攻击，注入干扰物可使任务准确率降低60%；某些对齐技术会放大此弱点；模型可能表现出隐蔽服从行为。提出的防御方法在挑战性干扰攻击上可将鲁棒性提高50多个点。

Conclusion: 推理分心是对LRM可靠性的独特且紧迫的威胁，提出的训练防御为构建更安全可信的推理系统提供了实用步骤。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注智能体系统的推理性能，但忽视了系统效率问题。网络交互式智能体系统存在显著的延迟瓶颈，影响实际应用效果。

Method: 将端到端延迟分解为LLM API延迟和网络环境延迟，通过15个模型和5个提供商的实证研究，提出SpecCache缓存框架，结合推测执行优化网络环境开销。

Result: 网络环境延迟可占整体延迟的53.7%，SpecCache相比随机缓存策略提升缓存命中率58倍，降低网络环境开销3.2倍，且不降低系统性能。

Conclusion: 智能体系统的效率优化至关重要，SpecCache框架能有效解决网络环境延迟问题，为构建高效智能体系统提供重要参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

Result: 未在摘要中明确说明

Conclusion: DTKG框架能够有效解决多跳问答中不同类型推理任务的挑战，提升问答效率和准确性

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

Method: 引入MedRule-KG知识图谱编码实体、关系和三个领域启发规则，配合符号验证器检查预测并应用最小修正来保证一致性。

Result: 在90个FDA衍生基准测试中，基于MedRule-KG的推理将精确匹配从0.767提升到0.900，添加验证器后达到1.000精确匹配，完全消除规则违反。

Conclusion: MedRule-KG为安全的数学推理提供了通用框架，通过知识图谱和符号验证确保推理的数学一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的概念擦除方法依赖固定锚点策略，常导致概念重现和侵蚀等关键问题。

Method: 通过因果追踪揭示擦除对锚点选择的内在敏感性，定义兄弟排他概念作为更优锚点类别，提出包含两阶段评估机制的SELECT框架。

Result: SELECT作为通用锚点解决方案，能高效适应多种擦除框架，在关键性能指标上持续优于现有基线，单个概念锚点挖掘平均仅需4秒。

Conclusion: 动态锚点选择框架SELECT有效解决了固定锚点策略的局限性，实现了更精确的概念擦除同时保留相关概念。

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了用户如何通过战略性地与算法互动来使其与自身真实兴趣对齐，提出了一个双系统决策模型，并定义了"对齐负担"的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户在算法平台上的互动往往表现出不一致的偏好，可能花费大量时间在低价值内容上，这导致算法无法准确反映用户的真实兴趣。

Method: 将用户决策过程建模为理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长），并构建多领导者-单跟随者的扩展Stackelberg博弈模型。

Result: 存在一个关键时间范围：足够有远见的用户可以实现算法对齐，而短视的用户则会被算法目标同化。小的成本信号（如额外点击）能显著降低对齐负担。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了具有不一致偏好的用户如何在Stackelberg均衡中使参与驱动型算法与其兴趣对齐，揭示了实现对齐的挑战和潜在解决方案。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合监控-生成-验证的LLM推理框架，在GSM8K数学推理任务上取得了75.42%的准确率，优于现有方法，且需要更少的迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理方法存在两个孤立范式：监控-生成方法擅长策略规划但缺乏验证机制，生成-验证方法能迭代优化但缺乏策略基础。这种分离导致策略失败无反馈、优化无战略指导的低效问题。

Method: 基于Flavell的认知监控模型，实现了一个三阶段迭代系统，将监控、生成和验证整合到一个统一框架中。

Result: 在GSM8K数据集上达到75.42%准确率，优于SELF-REFINE(68.44%)和Self-Verification(67.07%)，且平均尝试次数更少(1.3 vs 2.0)，推理成本增加27-37%。

Conclusion: 前置监控能产生更高质量的初始解决方案，从而减少优化需求。但需要在算术推理之外的任务上进行更多评估以验证通用性。

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

Conclusion: HSCM为捕捉因果关系和提升模型鲁棒性提供了更原则性的方法，在动态复杂环境中实现更有效的迁移学习。

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

*Ao Tian,Yunfeng Lu,Xinxin Fan,Changhao Wang,Lanzhi Zhou,Yeyao Zhang,Yanfang Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RGMem框架通过多尺度信息压缩和涌现过程，从对话历史中动态构建用户画像，实现语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案如RAG和显式记忆系统主要关注事实级存储和检索，缺乏从多轮对话中提取潜在偏好和深层特征的能力，限制了长期有效的用户建模。

Method: 受物理学重整化群思想启发，RGMem框架将对话历史组织为多尺度结构：首先从片段中提取语义和用户洞察，然后通过分层粗粒化和重标度操作，逐步形成动态演化的用户画像。

Result: 该框架能够从嘈杂的微观交互中实现高层次、准确的用户画像构建。

Conclusion: RGMem通过模拟记忆演化的多尺度过程，解决了LLM时代语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性问题。

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReviewSense是一个基于大语言模型的处方性决策支持框架，将客户评论转化为可操作的企业建议，超越了传统的偏好预测系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统擅长预测用户偏好，但缺乏将客户评论转化为面向企业的处方性建议的能力，而客户反馈对战略增长至关重要。

Method: 整合聚类、LLM适应和专家驱动评估的统一流程，识别客户情绪中的关键趋势、重复问题和具体关注点。

Result: 初步人工评估显示模型建议与企业目标高度一致，具有推动数据驱动决策的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的情感分析提供了新视角，在优化企业战略和最大化客户反馈影响力方面具有重要价值。

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

*Xiaozhe Li,Xinyu Fang,Shengyuan Ding,Linyang Li,Haodong Duan,Qingwen Liu,Kai Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了NP-ENGINE框架，这是首个专门训练和评估LLMs在NP难问题上的综合框架，包含10个任务、可控实例生成器、规则验证器和启发式求解器。训练出的模型在NP-BENCH基准上超越GPT-4o，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学、编程等推理任务上表现出色，但在更复杂的NP难优化问题上的能力尚未充分探索，需要专门的训练和评估框架。

Method: 提出NP-ENGINE框架，包含生成器-验证器-启发式求解器管道，支持可扩展的RLVR训练；使用零RLVR和课程学习训练QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型。

Result: QWEN2.5-7B-NP在NP-BENCH基准上显著超越GPT-4o，达到同模型尺寸下的SOTA性能；在逻辑、谜题、数学等跨领域任务上展现出强泛化能力；发现任务多样性增加能提升泛化性能的扩展规律。

Conclusion: 任务丰富的RLVR训练是提升LLM推理能力的有前景方向，为RLVR的扩展规律提供了新见解，NP难问题的训练有助于提升模型在各类推理任务上的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

*Eilene Tomkins-Flanagan,Connor Hanley,Mary A. Kelly*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Doug是一种类型化计算机语言，所有类型化程序都能被证明在多项式时间内停止运行，编码在向量符号架构中。它基于轻量线性函数式编程语言，类型使用全息声明性内存编码，术语使用Lisp VSA变体编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 希望通过Doug描述一种技能获取形式，遵循人类般的技能获取速度，超越现有方法的效率，更接近模拟人类大脑中的心理表征及其实际学习过程。

Method: 将轻量线性函数式编程语言编码到向量符号架构中，类型使用基于全息声明性内存的槽值编码方案，术语使用Lisp VSA变体编码。

Result: Doug允许神经网络嵌入空间中的某些点被解释为类型，邻近点的类型在结构和内容上都相似，因此类型可以被神经网络学习。

Conclusion: 该方法使我们更接近模拟人类大脑中实际存在的心理表征及其学习过程，为技能获取提供更高效的途径。

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速城市化增加了对城市通用智能的需求，但现有基于监督微调的城市基础模型存在持续的地理偏见，导致区域预测偏差和有限泛化能力。

Method: 提出Urban-R1框架，采用Group Relative Policy Optimization优化跨地理群体的推理，使用城市区域画像作为代理任务从多模态城市数据提供可衡量的奖励。

Result: 跨多个区域和任务的广泛实验表明，Urban-R1有效减轻地理偏见并改善跨区域泛化，优于监督微调训练和闭源模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习对齐是实现公平可信城市智能的有前景途径。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization intensifies the demand for Urban General Intelligence
(UGI), referring to AI systems that can understand and reason about complex
urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

TL;DR: BuildArena是首个面向语言驱动工程建设的物理对齐交互基准，用于评估LLM在工程建筑自动化中的能力，包含可定制框架、可扩展任务设计、3D空间几何计算库和基线LLM代理工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程建筑自动化需要将自然语言规范转化为物理可行的结构，但现代LLM在此领域的能力尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 开发了BuildArena基准，包含可定制框架、跨静态和动态力学的可扩展任务设计、3D空间几何计算库，以及基线LLM代理工作流。

Result: 在八个前沿LLM上全面评估了它们在语言驱动和物理基础建设自动化方面的能力。

Conclusion: BuildArena为语言驱动的工程建筑自动化提供了首个系统评估基准，有助于推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language
specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated
reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM
agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On
eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities
for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project

### [326] [Ripple Effect Protocol: Coordinating Agent Populations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16572)
*Ayush Chopra,Aman Sharma,Feroz Ahmad,Luca Muscariello,Vijoy Pandey,Ramesh Raskar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)协调协议，通过让智能体分享决策和轻量级敏感性信号，改善群体协调效果，在多个测试场景中比A2A协议提升41-100%的协调准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI智能体通信协议如A2A和ACP过于强调通信而忽视协调，导致智能体群体规模扩大时出现脆弱的集体行为，个体智能的智能体却达成糟糕的群体结果。

Method: 引入Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)协调协议，智能体不仅分享决策，还分享轻量级敏感性信号（表达关键环境变量变化时选择如何改变），这些敏感性在局部网络中传播，使群体更快更稳定地达成一致。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中：(i)供应链级联（啤酒游戏）、(ii)稀疏网络中的偏好聚合（电影排期）、(iii)可持续资源分配（渔业银行），REP相比A2A协议在协调准确性和效率上提升了41-100%，并能灵活处理来自LLM的多模态敏感性信号。

Conclusion: 通过将协调作为协议级能力，REP为新兴的智能体互联网提供了可扩展的基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphFlow是一个基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过流匹配目标优化检索策略和流估计器，从文本丰富的知识图谱中高效检索准确多样的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法难以从文本丰富的知识图谱中为复杂现实查询检索准确多样的信息，而过程奖励模型需要昂贵的过程级监督信号。

Method: 使用基于转换的流匹配目标联合优化检索策略和流估计器，流估计器将检索结果的奖励分解到中间检索状态，指导检索策略按奖励比例从知识图谱中检索候选结果。

Result: 在STaRK基准测试中，GraphFlow在命中率和召回率上平均优于包括GPT-4o在内的强基线方法10%，并对未见过的知识图谱表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphFlow能够有效从文本丰富的知识图谱中检索准确多样的知识，在现实查询中表现出优越性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督置信分布学习方法用于不确定知识图谱补全，通过将置信度转换为分布来增强嵌入学习，并使用元学习生成伪标签来平衡置信度分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定知识图谱补全方法忽略了置信度的极度不平衡分布，导致学习到的嵌入不足以支持高质量的知识图谱补全。

Method: 提出ssCDL方法，将置信度转换为置信分布引入更多监督信息，通过元学习生成伪标签来扩充训练数据并重新平衡置信度分布。

Result: 在两个不确定知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，ssCDL在不同评估指标上始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ssCDL方法通过处理置信度不平衡问题，有效提升了不确定知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

TL;DR: MERCI是一种新颖的强化学习算法，通过基于计数的内在奖励来增强LLM推理中的探索，避免重复和次优的推理模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL范式依赖稀疏的结果奖励和有限探索，导致LLM倾向于重复和次优的推理模式，需要设计更好的探索机制。

Method: 使用轻量级的Coin Flipping Network估计伪计数和认知不确定性，将其转换为内在奖励，并与GRPO等先进RL框架集成。

Result: 在复杂推理基准测试中，MERCI鼓励更丰富多样的思维链，显著提升性能，帮助策略逃离局部模式发现更好解决方案。

Conclusion: 有针对性的内在动机可以使语言模型推理中的探索更加可靠有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse
research applications is provided.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于大语言模型的代理框架(AFL)，用于完全自动化解决复杂车辆路径问题，从问题实例直接生成解决方案代码，无需人工干预或外部求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的方法在解决复杂VRP问题时仍需要外部干预，导致自主性受限、执行错误和解决方案可行性低。需要实现从问题实例到解决方案的完全自动化。

Method: AFL框架将整个流程分解为三个可管理的子任务，使用四个专门代理通过协调交互来确保跨功能一致性和逻辑合理性，直接从原始输入中提取知识并生成自包含代码。

Result: 在60个复杂VRP问题上的实验表明，该框架与精心设计的算法性能相当，在代码可靠性和解决方案可行性方面显著优于现有基于LLM的基线方法，在评估基准上接近100%的成功率。

Conclusion: AFL框架实现了复杂车辆路径问题求解的完全自动化，通过多代理协调机制确保了解决方案的可靠性和可行性，为LLM在复杂优化问题中的应用提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

TL;DR: 该论文对基于强化学习的代理搜索进行了首次全面综述，从功能角色、优化策略和应用范围三个维度组织这一新兴领域，总结了代表性方法、评估协议和应用，并讨论了构建可靠可扩展系统的挑战和未来方向。

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于代理模型的仿真驱动工程工作流，通过训练轻量级仿真器来解决计算成本高和模型透明度不足的问题，支持不确定性量化和可解释AI分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仿真驱动工程工作流面临两个核心挑战：(1) 高计算成本，因为准确探索需要大量昂贵的仿真器运行；(2) 当决策依赖于不透明的黑盒组件时，透明度和可靠性有限。

Method: 通过在紧凑的实验设计上训练轻量级仿真器，提供快速、低延迟的昂贵仿真器近似，支持严格的不确定性量化，并适用于全局和局部可解释AI分析。

Conclusion: 该工作流统一了从工程设计到基于代理的社会环境理解等各种基于仿真的复杂系统分析工具，提供了使用基于代理的可解释性工具的对比方法和实用建议。

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了ELMM模型，通过多视图视觉令牌压缩器和注意力剪枝策略，解决多模态知识图谱补全中的语义噪声、模态冲突和计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态知识图谱存在不完整性问题，而现有方法在处理多模态信息时面临语义噪声、模态冲突和高计算成本的挑战。

Method: 使用基于多头注意力的多视图视觉令牌压缩器自适应压缩图像令牌，设计注意力剪枝策略减少冗余层，并通过线性投影补偿性能损失。

Result: 在FB15k-237-IMG和WN18-IMG基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: ELMM为多模态知识图谱补全建立了新的范式，在保持高性能的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

TL;DR: ELLSA是首个全双工、端到端的多模态模型，能够同时感知和生成视觉、文本、语音和动作，实现更自然的人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类交互本质上是多模态和全双工的，需要模型能够同时感知和生成多种模态，实现更自然的人类行为模拟。

Method: 采用新颖的SA-MoE架构（自注意力专家混合），将各模态路由到专门专家，通过统一注意力骨干网络融合，实现多模态感知和并发生成。

Result: 在语音交互和机器人操作基准测试中，ELLSA与模态特定基线表现相当，同时独特支持高级多模态和全双工行为，如对话和动作轮转、缺陷指令拒绝、边说边做等。

Conclusion: ELLSA代表了向更自然和通用交互智能迈出的一步，为追求通用人工智能做出贡献。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: GraphVista是一个统一的图理解框架，通过分层组织图信息到轻量级GraphRAG基础中，并引入规划代理来协调文本和视觉模态，解决了VLMs在图理解中的可扩展性和模态协调问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在图理解中面临的输入令牌限制、可扩展性瓶颈以及缺乏有效协调文本和视觉模态机制的问题。

Method: 1. 可扩展性：通过分层组织图信息到GraphRAG基础中，仅检索任务相关的文本描述和高分辨率视觉子图；2. 模态协调：引入规划代理，根据任务复杂度路由到最适合的模态（文本模态处理简单属性推理，视觉模态处理局部和结构复杂推理）。

Result: GraphVista可扩展到比现有基准大200倍的大型图，在质量上比最先进的基线方法提升4.4倍，持续优于现有的文本、视觉和融合方法。

Conclusion: GraphVista通过充分利用文本和视觉模态的互补优势，有效解决了图理解中的可扩展性和模态协调挑战，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in graph understanding, but
remain limited by input-token constraints, facing scalability bottlenecks and
lacking effective mechanisms to coordinate textual and visual modalities. To
address these challenges, we propose GraphVista, a unified framework that
enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱受限于固定本体论的刚性层次结构，将领域作为隐含上下文而非显式推理组件。

Method: 采用<概念, 关系@领域, 概念'>的三元组结构，基于认知-语言学同构映射原理，定义20多个标准化关系谓词，并在Prolog中实现完整推理能力。

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和文档管理等案例中证明CDC支持上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模。

Conclusion: CDC框架克服了传统基于本体的知识建模限制，实现了传统框架无法达到的能力。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

Motivation: 现有基于工作流的数据代理在特定数据任务上表现良好，但依赖预定义工作流，无法实现完全自主的数据科学。

Method: 提出基于课程学习的智能训练范式，模拟人类数据科学家的学习轨迹，使LLM能够在真实环境中逐步获取和整合多种能力；同时引入数据驱动的轨迹合成框架构建高质量训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，仅8B参数的DeepAnalyze在性能上超越了基于最先进专有LLM构建的工作流代理。

Conclusion: DeepAnalyze模型、代码和训练数据已开源，为自主数据科学的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Motivation: 解决VLM代理从文本状态转向复杂视觉观察时面临的局部可观测性和世界建模挑战，探索代理能否通过显式视觉状态推理构建内部世界模型。

Result: 3B参数模型在五个多样化代理基准测试中获得0.82分，相比未训练模型(0.21)提升3倍，优于GPT-5(0.75)、Gemini 2.5 Pro(0.67)和Claude 4.5(0.62)等专有推理模型。

Conclusion: 视觉状态推理能有效提升VLM代理性能；最优信念表示形式是任务依赖的；状态估计和转移建模的分解对成功至关重要；世界建模奖励和双层GAE方法显著改善训练效果。

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 可解释强化学习算法的调试应用缺乏比较性评估，需要了解不同算法的相对性能表现。

Method: 使用Atari的Ms. Pacman环境和四种XRL算法，设计实验测试用户从决策解释中识别智能体目标的能力。

Result: 只有一种XRL算法在测试目标上达到超过随机水平的准确率；用户普遍过度自信；用户自报告的识别难易度和理解度与实际准确率不相关。

Conclusion: 当前XRL算法在帮助用户识别智能体目标方面的效果有限，用户感知与实际性能存在差距，需要改进评估方法和算法设计。

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation
methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an
explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman
environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not
correlate with their accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核优化对现代AI发展至关重要，但现有LLM方法通常将其视为单次生成或简单优化工具，无法有效应对复杂的内核优化挑战。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，结合基础指令、动态上下文管理和策略搜索，使LLM能够推理硬件权衡、整合性能分析反馈并进行迭代优化。

Result: 在KernelBench基准测试中，系统在基线方法经常失败的情况下产生正确解决方案，并实现高达16倍的运行时性能提升。

Conclusion: 智能体LLM框架具有推动完全自动化、可扩展GPU内核优化的潜力。

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Motivation: 工具增强的大型语言模型在现实应用中越来越广泛，但工具使用错误仍然阻碍其可靠性，需要一种方法来诊断和改进LLM在工具增强对话中的行为。

Method: 提出ToolCritic框架，检测8种特定工具调用错误类型，提供针对性反馈给主LLM，主LLM基于反馈修正响应。构建合成数据集训练ToolCritic。

Result: 在Schema-Guided Dialogue数据集上的实验结果表明，ToolCritic相比基线方法（包括零样本提示和自校正技术）将工具调用准确率提升高达13%。

Conclusion: ToolCritic代表了在现实世界对话应用中实现更鲁棒的LLM与外部工具集成的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序虽然能识别多样细胞类型，但对涉及特征不明确基因的转录组特征注释仍面临挑战。传统方法如GSEA依赖精心策划的注释，在这些情况下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了BRAINCELL-AID多智能体AI系统，整合自由文本描述和本体标签，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术构建稳健的智能工作流，通过PubMed文献精炼预测。

Result: 在鼠类基因集中实现了77%的正确注释率，成功注释了BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network生成的5,322个脑细胞簇，识别了区域特异性基因共表达模式，并发现了与基底神经节相关的细胞类型。

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID创建了一个有价值的资源，支持社区驱动的细胞类型注释，为脑细胞功能提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

Motivation: 解决企业信用评估中非财务定性指标的自动化推理问题，现有方法主要关注数值预测，缺乏对专业贷款评估所需的解释性判断支持。

Method: 开发了两种LLM系统：单代理系统(NAS)通过单次推理管道生成双向分析；多代理辩论系统(KPD-MADS)基于卡尔·波普尔批判对话框架，采用十步结构化交互协议进行对抗性验证。

Result: 两个系统都实现了显著的生产力提升(NAS:11.55秒/案例；KPD-MADS:91.97秒；人工基准:1920秒)。KPD-MADS在解释充分性(4.0 vs 3.0)、实际适用性(4.0 vs 3.0)和可用性(62.5 vs 52.5)方面获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理交互可以增强金融AI中的推理严谨性和可解释性，推动企业信用评估的可扩展和可辩护自动化。

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于手工特征的方法，通过从鱼眼图像中提取颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图以及LBP和GLCM纹理特征来评估鱼类新鲜度，显著超越了之前的深度学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、不一致性和难以标准化的问题，需要开发客观、可靠的自动化评估方法。

Method: 从鱼眼图像中系统提取互补特征描述符，包括颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图、LBP和GLCM纹理特征，融合全局色度变化和局部ROI退化特征，使用LightGBM和ANN进行分类。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，LightGBM达到77.56%准确率（比之前深度学习基线提升14.35%），使用增强数据的ANN达到97.16%准确率（比之前最佳提升19.86%）。

Conclusion: 精心设计的手工特征经过策略性处理后，能够为自动化鱼类新鲜度评估提供鲁棒、可解释且可靠的解决方案，对食品质量监控具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

*Subin Lin,Chuanbo Hua*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了PILLM框架，将物理原理融入大语言模型，通过进化循环自动生成、评估和优化HVAC系统异常检测规则，在保持可解释性的同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HVAC系统能耗巨大，传统规则方法可解释但缺乏适应性，深度学习方法预测能力强但缺乏透明度和物理合理性，现有LLM方法忽视物理原理。

Method: 开发了PILLM框架，引入物理启发的反思和交叉算子，嵌入热力学和控制理论约束，在进化循环中自动生成和优化异常检测规则。

Result: 在公共建筑故障检测数据集上达到最先进性能，生成的诊断规则具有可解释性和可操作性。

Conclusion: PILLM框架推进了智能建筑系统中可信赖和可部署AI的发展，实现了自适应且物理基础的异常检测。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

TL;DR: ProtocolBench是一个系统评估多智能体系统通信协议的基准测试，ProtocolRouter是一个可学习的协议路由器，能根据场景需求选择最优协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统中，通信协议选择缺乏标准化指导，往往基于直觉，影响系统性能和可靠性。

Method: 开发ProtocolBench基准测试，从任务成功率、端到端延迟、消息开销和故障恢复能力四个维度评估协议；提出ProtocolRouter协议路由器，基于需求和运行时信号选择最优协议。

Result: 不同协议在Streaming Queue场景中完成时间差异达36.5%，端到端延迟差异达3.48秒；ProtocolRouter相比最佳单协议基线将故障恢复时间降低18.1%，在GAIA场景中实现更高成功率。

Conclusion: 协议选择对多智能体系统性能有显著影响，ProtocolBench和ProtocolRouter提供了系统化的协议评估和选择方案，提升了系统可靠性。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合ECG基础模型和可解释XGBoost分类器的混合预测框架，用于急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常的风险预测，在提高准确性的同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常是院内死亡的主要原因，传统风险评分性能有限，而端到端深度学习模型缺乏临床信任所需的可解释性。

Method: 使用ECG基础模型(ECGFounder)提取150维诊断概率特征，通过特征选择后训练XGBoost分类器，并采用SHAP方法进行可解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型AUC达到0.801，优于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和1D-CNN(0.720)，SHAP分析显示模型识别特征与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为VT/VF风险预测提供了新范式，验证了基础模型输出作为有效自动化特征工程在构建可信赖、可解释AI临床决策支持系统中的应用。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过评估优先的方法实现个性化健康教练，避免平均指标掩盖对特定用户群体的伤害。

Method: 使用离线策略评估分析因子化决策头（工具/风格），并通过轻量级模拟器测试添加信息增益奖励的效果。

Result: 统一重工具策略会损害低健康素养/高自我效能用户；添加早期信息增益奖励可缩短特质识别时间，提高目标成功率和pass@3指标。

Conclusion: 建议采用评估优先的个性化路径：冻结生成器，在类型化奖励上学习子群体感知的决策头，并始终报告每个原型指标以揭示被平均掩盖的子群体伤害。

Abstract: We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In
a pilot with seven users (280 rated turns), offline policy evaluation (OPE)
over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疾病进展建模方法无法从真实世界数据中学习或捕捉复杂的连续时间动态，需要解决基于不规则时间事件样本和患者异质性的挑战。

Method: 使用时间详细超图表示临床认可的进展轨迹，通过神经ODE框架学习连续时间进展动态，包含可学习的TD-Hypergraph Laplacian捕获疾病并发症标记在进展轨迹内和轨迹间的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实世界临床数据集上的实验表明，TD-HNODE在建模2型糖尿病和相关心血管疾病进展方面优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-HNODE能够有效建模疾病进展的连续时间动态，解决了现有方法的局限性，在临床疾病进展预测方面具有良好性能。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and

that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto
platforms (4.62/5).

Motivation: 密集多智能体路径规划问题在实时环境中仍然具有挑战性，现有方法表现不佳，需要结合学习和搜索的优势。

Method: 开发了增强的MAGAT架构，采用预训练-微调策略，结合死锁检测机制来处理不完美的神经引导，将学习到的启发式集成到LaCAM搜索算法中。

Result: LaGAT在密集场景中优于纯搜索和纯学习方法，证明了精心设计的混合搜索方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 经过精心设计的混合搜索方法为紧密耦合、具有挑战性的多智能体协调问题提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

Motivation: 传统基于声明的模型在复杂环境中存在局限，单一规划器生成的规划可能无法满足代理偏好，需要语义多样化的规划方案。

Method: FBI_LTL利用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，并将这些基于LTL的多样性模型直接集成到搜索过程中，确保生成语义多样化的规划。

Result: 在各种基准测试上的广泛评估表明，FBI_LTL相比基线方法能生成更多样化的规划。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了在仿真环境中进行语义引导多样化规划的可行性，为在传统基于模型方法失效的现实非符号领域中创新方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

Motivation: 为了在地理区域内进行侦察以维持共同作战态势，需要一种能够平衡广泛区域搜索和已识别目标跟踪的方法。

Result: 该方法能够有效指导代理在地理地图上的移动，在模拟中实现了探索和利用的平衡。

Conclusion: 主动推理路径规划方法为智能代理的自主控制提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂环境中的侦察任务。

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统法律机器学习将过去案例结果视为绝对真实，但法律结果常受和解、上诉等程序性干预影响，造成标签不确定性，需要专门处理。

Method: 在欧洲人权法院案例分类背景下，分析不同标签构建方式对模型行为的影响，探讨处理标签不确定性的方法。

Result: 研究表明标签构建方式会显著影响模型行为，标签不确定性是AI与法律领域的重要关注点。

Conclusion: 法律机器学习应用必须考虑标签不确定性，这会影响模型表现，是AI与法律交叉领域的关键问题。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个推理时、可插拔模型的多模态虚假信息检测框架，通过分解为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断，在MMFakeBench上达到81.65% F1分数，优于最强零样本基线7.65个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上每天有数十亿包含文本和图像的多模态帖子传播虚假信息，超出了人工事实核查的能力。现有的监督检测模型需要领域特定训练数据，且无法泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: MIRAGE框架将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：检测AI生成图像、识别跨模态不一致、通过迭代问题生成进行检索增强的事实核查、以及整合所有信号的校准判断模块。该框架协调视觉语言模型推理与针对性网络检索。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集（1,000样本）上，MIRAGE使用GPT-4o-mini达到81.65% F1和75.1%准确率，优于GPT-4V与MMD-Agent基线（74.0% F1）7.65个百分点，假阳性率为34.3%，而仅判断基线的假阳性率为97.3%。测试集（5,000样本）结果确认泛化能力，达到81.44% F1和75.08%准确率。

Conclusion: 分解的智能体推理与网络检索可以在没有领域特定训练的情况下匹配监督检测器的性能，使得在标注数据稀缺的多模态场景中也能进行虚假信息检测。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

TL;DR: OG-Rank是一个低延迟的解码器重排序系统，通过池化首词评分和不确定性门控解释步骤，在保持可预测延迟的同时提供强效的排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生需要实时工作并能解释其选择的排序系统，因此需要开发低延迟、基于解码器的重排序器。

Method: 采用单解码器方法，结合池化首词评分信号和不确定性门控解释步骤。模型在一次前向传递中评分所有候选，仅在列表真正模糊时生成简短的结构化理由。使用专注于困难案例的课程训练策略。

Result: 在遭遇范围订单选择任务中表现优异：快速路径Recall@1约0.45，nDCG@20约0.625；当门控激活时性能进一步提升（Recall@1约0.56，nDCG@20约0.699，门控率45%）。紧凑骨干网络在相同策略下也显示类似增益。

Conclusion: OG-Rank提供了一个实用方案：默认快速排序，在有益时进行解释。这种模式适用于选择性生成能以可接受成本换取准确性的决策任务。单策略设计简化了部署和预算规划，课程原则可广泛迁移到临床订单选择之外的应用。

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

Conclusion: MAIDs框架为多智能体强化学习提供了有效的分析和设计工具，定向干预范式能够缓解全局指导问题，因果推断技术有助于实现期望的行为结果。

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

Conclusion: VLMs编码了可靠的内部证据但利用不足，使这些信号显式化可以弥合感知与推理之间的差距，推进VLM的诊断理解和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.
