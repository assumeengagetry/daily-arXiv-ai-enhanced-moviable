<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在真实临床环境中的质量仍不足，而大型视觉语言模型在通用领域通过采用LLM训练策略取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）和随机对比采样构建训练对，无需奖励模型或人工偏好标注。

Result: 在三个最先进模型上补充使用随机DPO后，临床性能指标提升高达5%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升放射学报告生成质量，且无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

*William Saakyan,Matthias Norden,Lola Eversmann,Simon Kirsch,Muyu Lin,Simon Guendelman,Isabel Dziobek,Hanna Drimalla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多模态分析方法，通过整合面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和注视行为来改进自闭症谱系障碍的计算机辅助诊断，特别引入了新的统计描述符来量化注视角度变异性，将分类准确率提升至74%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自闭症计算机辅助诊断方法在注视特征性能不佳和缺乏现实世界泛化性方面存在挑战，需要开发更有效和可扩展的筛查工具。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集，进行多模态分析，包括面部表情、语音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性和注视行为，并引入新的注视角度变异性统计描述符，采用后期融合方法整合多模态特征。

Result: 新的注视描述符将基于注视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，多模态融合后总体分类准确率达到74%，验证了多模态行为标记在自闭症检测中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于视频的多模态行为分析在开发可扩展的自闭症筛查工具方面的潜力，为支持自闭症评估提供了新的技术途径。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

### [3] [KV-Efficient VLA: A Method of Speed up Vision Language Model with RNN-Gated Chunked KV Cache](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21354)
*Wanshun Xu,Long Zhuang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的记忆压缩框架，通过轻量级训练友好机制选择性保留高价值上下文，解决VLA模型中注意力二次成本和KV内存无限增长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLA模型在长时推理过程中面临注意力二次成本和KV内存无限增长的问题，现有方法虽然通过扩展骨干架构改进了泛化能力，但往往忽视了实时部署所需的关键推理效率。

Method: 将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习到的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文，保留最近的细粒度细节，同时积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存，同时保持因果性。

Result: 理论上可实现1.21倍推理加速和36% KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响最小，能够无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中。

Conclusion: KV-Efficient VLA框架能够在不修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑的情况下实现可扩展推理，解决了VLA模型在长时推理中的效率和内存瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

### [4] [Phrase-grounded Fact-checking for Automatically Generated Chest X-ray Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21356)
*Razi Mahmood,Diego Machado-Reyes,Joy Wu,Parisa Kaviani,Ken C. L. Wong,Niharika D'Souza,Mannudeep Kalra,Ge Wang,Pingkun Yan,Tanveer Syeda-Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于短语定位的事实核查模型，用于检测自动生成的胸部X光报告中发现的错误及其位置，通过多标签跨模态对比回归网络实现高精度验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告存在事实错误和幻觉问题，阻碍了临床应用的推广，需要开发有效的事实核查方法。

Method: 通过扰动真实报告中的发现和位置创建合成数据集，训练多标签跨模态对比回归网络来检测报告中的错误。

Result: 在多个X光数据集上展示了方法在发现真实性预测和定位方面的鲁棒性，与基于真实情况的验证达到了0.997的相关系数。

Conclusion: 该方法在放射学工作流程的临床推理中具有实用价值，能够有效检测最先进报告生成器产生的错误。

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

### [5] [MDF-MLLM: Deep Fusion Through Cross-Modal Feature Alignment for Contextually Aware Fundoscopic Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21358)
*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MDF-MLLM多模态深度学习架构，通过融合视网膜眼底图像的细粒度特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升疾病分类准确率，在双类型疾病分类任务中达到94%准确率，比基线提升56%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键空间细节方面存在不足，需要改进以提升疾病分类准确性。

Method: 将U-Net编码器四层的跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，采用补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行特征融合。

Result: 在1,305个眼底图像-文本对数据集上，MDF-MLLM达到94%准确率，比基线60%提升56%；召回率和F1分数分别提升67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM为眼底图像分类提供了可泛化、可解释和模块化的框架，在空间推理和分类方面表现优异，特别适用于具有丰富临床文本的遗传性疾病。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

### [6] [Multimodal Prompt Decoupling Attack on the Safety Filters in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21360)
*Xingkai Peng,Jun Jiang,Meng Tong,Shuai Li,Weiming Zhang,Nenghai Yu,Kejiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MPDA多模态提示解耦攻击方法，利用图像模态分离有害语义组件，通过LLM将不安全提示分解为伪安全提示和有害提示，绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，对基于图像输入的漏洞探索不足，且文本方法难以绕过模型安全过滤器。

Method: 使用LLM解耦不安全提示为伪安全提示和有害提示，将有害提示重写为自然对抗提示，通过视觉语言模型生成图像描述确保语义一致性。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: MPDA揭示了多模态输入在T2I模型安全漏洞中的重要性，为防御此类攻击提供了新视角。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

### [7] [A Mutual Learning Method for Salient Object Detection with intertwined Multi-Supervision--Revised](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21363)
*Runmin Wu,Mengyang Feng,Wenlong Guan,Dong Wang,Huchuan Lu,Errui Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种通过结合显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测的多任务学习方法，利用相互学习模块提升显著目标检测的完整性和边界精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前显著目标检测中存在的预测不完整和边界不准确问题，这些问题源于目标内部复杂性和卷积池化操作的步幅影响。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，将显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务相互监督；开发相互学习模块(MLM)，通过多个网络分支的相互学习提升性能。

Result: 在七个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过多任务相互监督和相互学习机制，有效提升了显著目标检测的完整性和边界精度，在多个数据集上实现了state-of-the-art的结果。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

### [8] [MAJORScore: A Novel Metric for Evaluating Multimodal Relevance via Joint Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21365)
*Zhicheng Du,Qingyang Shi,Jiasheng Lu,Yingshan Liang,Xinyu Zhang,Yiran Wang,Peiwu Qin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAJORScore，一种新的多模态相关性评估指标，首次通过多模态联合表示来评估三个或更多模态之间的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标通常基于双模态数据的预训练对比学习模型，仅适用于两个模态之间的关联分析，这极大地限制了多模态相似性的评估。

Method: 利用多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到相同的潜在空间中，能够在同一尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平的相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上比现有方法提高了26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低了13.28%-20.54%。

Conclusion: MAJORScore为大规模多模态数据集上的相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估提供了更可靠的度量标准。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

*Sameer Prabhu,Amit Patwardhan,Ramin Karim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发基于AI的云平台，通过点云数据分析脚手架结构，实现自动化监测，提高安全检查效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脚手架安全检查依赖人工视觉检查，耗时且易出错，存在安全隐患，需要更准确高效的自动化解决方案

Method: 开发云基AI平台，处理点云数据，通过对比认证参考数据和最新点云数据来检测结构修改

Result: 提出的系统能够自动监测脚手架结构变化，减少人工检查时间和精力

Conclusion: AI和数字化技术能够显著提升脚手架安全检查的准确性和效率，改善施工现场安全状况

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

*Aleksa Jelaca,Ying Jiao,Chang Tian,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自动提示工程框架，通过图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练的排序器，实现反事实尺寸控制的文本到图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中反事实可控性的挑战，特别是反事实尺寸控制（如生成微小海象和巨大按钮），这对于创意和探索性应用至关重要。

Method: 构建包含图像评估器、监督提示重写器和DPO训练排序器的自动提示工程框架，创建首个反事实尺寸文本-图像数据集，并改进Grounded SAM模型。

Result: 图像评估器性能相比骨干网络提升114%，实验表明该方法优于最先进基线和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性的未来研究奠定了基础，在反事实尺寸控制方面表现出色。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

*Shiraz S Kaderuppan,Jonathan Mar,Andrew Irvine,Anurag Sharma,Muhammad Ramadan Saifuddin,Wai Leong Eugene Wong,Wai Lok Woo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了两种深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)在实现非荧光超分辨率光学显微镜方面的表现，发现它们在不同信噪比条件下具有互补性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统光学显微镜横向分辨率限制(~200nm)的问题，避免使用昂贵的专用设备或荧光超分辨率技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种自开发的深度神经网络架构(O-Net和Theta-Net)，对通过原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试靶进行超分辨率重建，评估非荧光相位调制显微镜模式(如Zernike相衬和微分干涉对比显微镜)的图像。

Result: 两种网络在超分辨率重建中都表现良好，但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合O-Net模型，低信噪比图像更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构与源图像信噪比对深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能至关重要，即使使用相同的训练数据集和训练周期，不同架构在不同条件下表现各异。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

*Yinfeng Yu,Hailong Zhang,Meiling Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DMTF-AVN方法，通过多目标架构和改进的Transformer机制，在视听导航任务中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在融合视觉和音频数据时往往忽略了更深层次的感知上下文，需要更有效地利用多模态线索来指导导航。

Method: 使用多目标架构结合改进的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上的实验表明，DMTF-AVN在成功率、路径效率和场景适应性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该模型展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力，为机器人导航中的先进多模态融合策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

*Enrico Cassano,Riccardo Renzulli,Marco Nurisso,Mirko Zaffaroni,Alan Perotti,Marco Grangetto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统性概念标注促进一对一的概念-神经元映射，显著减少文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘所需的超参数搜索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然能减少神经元的多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练，通过系统性概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，这种可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准上比现有技术提升9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进一对一概念-神经元映射，有效提升了文本到图像扩散模型中概念遗忘的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

### [15] [The LongiMam model for improved breast cancer risk prediction using longitudinal mammograms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21383)
*Manel Rakez,Thomas Louis,Julien Guillaumin,Foucauld Chamming's,Pierre Fillard,Brice Amadeo,Virginie Rondeau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四个先前的乳腺X光片，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络来捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式，在真实世界不平衡数据中显著改善了乳腺癌预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的先前乳腺X光片，缺乏对真实世界环境中不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应能力。

Method: 开发了LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络，整合当前和最多四个先前的乳腺X光片，捕捉空间和时间模式。使用大型基于人群的筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多个不同先前检查数量和组成的场景中，LongiMam在包含先前乳腺X光片时始终改善预测性能。先前和当前访问的组合优于单次访问模型，而仅使用先前检查效果较差。在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来优化风险分层。LongiMam作为开源软件公开发布。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

*Laurent Mertens,Elahe' Yargholi,Laura Van Hove,Hans Op de Beeck,Jan Van den Stock,Joost Vennekens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了CNN在复杂社会认知任务（图像情感评估）中与人类大脑处理的对齐程度，发现CNN难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理，并提出了Object2Brain框架来分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然CNN在一般视觉感知任务中显示出与人类大脑的对应关系，但尚未在更复杂的脑过程（如社会认知）中进行验证。本研究旨在探索CNN在图像情感评估这一社会认知任务中与人类行为数据和fMRI数据的对齐程度。

Method: 通过相关性分析评估流行CNN架构与人类行为数据和fMRI数据的对齐程度；提出Object2Brain框架，结合GradCAM和对象检测在CNN滤波器层面，分析不同对象类别对CNN-人类相关性的影响。

Result: CNN在图像情感评估任务中难以超越简单视觉处理，无法反映高阶大脑处理；尽管相关趋势相似，不同CNN架构显示出不同的对象类别敏感性。

Conclusion: CNN在复杂社会认知任务中与人类大脑处理的对齐有限，主要停留在简单视觉处理层面，无法捕捉高阶认知过程；不同架构对对象类别的敏感性存在差异。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a popular type of computer model
that have proven their worth in many computer vision tasks. Moreover, they form
an interesting study object for the field of psychology, with shown
correspondences between the workings of CNNs and the human brain. However,
these correspondences have so far mostly been studied in the context of general
visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [17] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，通过移除和重新训练两个步骤来减少概念瓶颈模型对不良概念的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念干预方法无法解决模型与专家推理之间的系统性偏差，特别是当模型从有偏数据中学习捷径时。

Method: 采用移除和重新训练两步骤：移除步骤中专家识别并移除不良概念；重新训练步骤使用CBDebug方法将概念级反馈转换为样本级辅助标签，应用监督偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构和基准测试中显著优于先前的重新训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效减少模型对不良概念的依赖，提高模型与专家推理的一致性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Motivation: 沉船是重要的海上历史标记，但通过人工检查测深数据发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发QGIS插件，使用深度学习模型处理测深数据，采用合成数据生成增强数据集，支持像素级分割掩码或边界框输出。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的开源解决方案，能够自动检测沉船，显著提高海洋考古和历史研究的效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

TL;DR: 研究显示轻到中度剪枝能提升显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，保持语义概念清晰；而过度剪枝会合并异质特征，降低可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，特别是对显著性图和概念表示的影响。

Method: 使用在ImageNette上训练的ResNet-18，比较不同剪枝水平下的Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT进行概念提取。

Result: 轻到中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦度和忠实度，同时保持了语义上有意义的概念；过度剪枝则合并了异质特征，降低了显著性图稀疏性和概念一致性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以塑造内部表示使其更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个基于多视角图像输入，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，联合进行室内布局估计和3D物体检测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖点云输入，但大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，视觉数据更为普遍。需要解决仅使用多视角图像进行室内场景理解的问题。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积主干网络，使用两个专用头：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中达到最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用带位姿图像，(iii)使用无位姿图像。在布局估计方面显著提升，为整体室内场景理解设定了新基准。

Conclusion: TUN3D在无需深度监督的情况下，实现了与专用3D物体检测方法相当的性能，同时在布局估计方面取得重大进展，推动了整体室内场景理解的发展。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能损害视觉关键内容的重建质量，需要解决语义通信系统中图像传输的效率和质量问题。

Method: 将图像分割为关键和非关键区域，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器，非关键区域采用图像到文本建模压缩，结合模型量化和低秩自适应微调技术实现轻量级部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，所提系统在语义保真度和视觉质量方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该系统在图像传输任务中表现出有效性，能够在提升资源利用率的同时保持性能。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Result: 实验证明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等任务中有效。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间提供了一种满足尺度空间特性的层次形状简化方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

<details>

Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率较低（如12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要高分辨率气候预测来支持本地决策。

Method: 在缺乏高分辨率气候预测训练数据的情况下，使用高分辨率观测网格数据集训练单图像超分辨率模型，并将其应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，利用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型能够降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型可以有效提升气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候信息。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Conclusion: 图像越狱攻击存在实际挑战，需要为视觉语言模型开发有效的防御机制

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

TL;DR: DyME是一个动态多概念擦除框架，通过训练轻量级LoRA适配器并在推理时动态组合，解决了现有静态擦除方法在多概念擦除中的局限性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型会无意中复制受版权保护的风格和视觉概念，引发法律和伦理问题。现有擦除方法无法扩展到需要擦除多个可能冲突概念的实用场景。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME持续优于现有最先进方法，实现了更高的多概念擦除保真度，同时最小化了对非目标内容的附带损害。

Conclusion: DyME通过动态适配器组合和正交性约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，为实际应用中的选择性概念抑制提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Dareen Alharthi,Seungone Kim,Bhiksha Raj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的3B和7B规模多模态大语言模型，在多数基准测试中优于更大的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore）无法捕捉人类判断的精细度，而人工评估成本高昂，需要开发专门针对视频理解任务的自动化评估方法。

Method: 通过生成器-评估器的交互训练：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，不匹配评估器评分的响应被丢弃，从而训练专门的MLLM评估器。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，VideoJudge-7B超越了更大的MLLM基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B），且发现提供视频输入对评估视频理解任务至关重要。

Conclusion: VideoJudge证明了专门化MLLM评估器在视频理解任务评估中的有效性，视频输入对于准确评估至关重要，长链推理并不能改善性能。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

### [30] [Residual Vector Quantization For Communication-Efficient Multi-Agent Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21464)
*Dereje Shenkut,B. V. K Vijaya Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273-1365倍压缩，同时保持感知精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输负载。

Method: 使用端到端方法，先通过瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后采用多阶段残差向量量化(RVQ)，仅传输每个像素的编码索引，大幅减少传输数据量。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X真实世界数据集上，ReVQom实现273倍压缩(30 bpp)到1365倍压缩(6 bpp)。在18 bpp(455倍压缩)时性能匹配或优于原始特征协同感知，在6-12 bpp时仍能保持可接受的性能。

Conclusion: ReVQom能够实现高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出了重要一步，支持超低带宽操作并具有优雅的性能退化特性。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits
per pixel (bpp) of uncompressed 32-bit float features to 6-30 bpp per agent
with minimal accuracy loss. On DAIR-V2X real-world CP dataset, ReVQom achieves
273x compression at 30 bpp to 1365x compression at 6 bpp. At 18 bpp (455x),
ReVQom matches or outperforms raw-feature CP, and at 6-12 bpp it enables
ultra-low-bandwidth operation with graceful degradation. ReVQom allows
efficient and accurate multi-agent collaborative perception with a step toward
practical V2X deployment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究分析了三种文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业形象时存在的性别刻板印象和文化不准确问题，发现这些模型都表现出严重的性别失衡和文化误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调查当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特职业形象时是否延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性，评估这些模型对沙特劳动力市场性别动态和文化细微差别的反映程度。

Method: 使用中性提示词为56种沙特职业生成1,006张图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估：感知性别、服装外貌、背景环境、活动互动和年龄，资深研究员裁决分歧，共获得10,100个判断。

Result: 三种模型都显示强烈性别失衡：ImageFX 85%男性，Grok 86.6%男性，DALL-E V3 96%男性，其中DALL-E V3性别刻板印象最强。领导和技术角色性别失衡最明显，所有模型都经常出现服装、环境和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前模型反映了训练数据中嵌入的社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别提供有限反映。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和文化敏感的评估框架来确保公平真实的视觉输出。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于统一不当内容检测的推理增强多模态大语言模型预训练范式，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容与原始预训练数据之间的分布差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种问题类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、Chain-of-Thought（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果显示该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，并对未见问题表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差距和复杂问题定义挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位任务从坐标预测重构为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，显著提高了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于坐标预测的GUI定位方法在复杂布局下精度不足，需要更直观的交互方式来提高定位准确性。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位作为交互式搜索任务，模型通过多步移动光标来定位目标元素，使用强化学习训练。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2数据集上准确率从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，95%的实例在两步内解决。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比直接坐标预测更有效，能够自适应处理不同难度的定位任务，显著提升GUI定位性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度无法解释排序结果，限制了可解释性

Method: 在现有基准上添加视频标注以支持语义理解和减少数据偏差，设计包含成对比较步骤的检索思维链，产生详细推理和完整排序

Result: X-CoT在实证中提高了检索性能并产生详细推理依据，有助于模型行为和数据质量分析

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法改善了传统嵌入模型的局限性，提供了更好的模型评估和数据检查能力

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全性需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但手动检查容易出错，现有的自动化方法在自然/工业图像上训练，无法有效迁移到手术领域，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感和领域偏移问题。

Method: 整合背景掩蔽、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法克服了现有方法的局限性，能够在手术器械图像中可靠地检测细粒度缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过针对手术器械的专门调整，实现了可靠的缺陷检测，解决了现有方法在手术领域应用中的关键问题。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的替代方案来改进扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出线性可分性(LSEP)正则化，将线性探测直接融入网络学习动态，无需辅助编码器和表示对齐，促进中间层表示的线性可分性。

Result: 在256×256 ImageNet数据集上达到FID 1.46，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了基于对齐的方法，无需外部编码器，将线性探测整合到训练过程中，实现了更好的表示学习和生成性能。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间正则化对比学习策略，通过整合半变异函数来建模空间相关性，解决图像地理定位中的假阴性和难负样本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在全局图像地理定位中忽略了空间依赖性，导致无法有效处理假阴性样本（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远）。

Method: 使用半变异函数将特征空间中的图像距离与其地理距离关联，建立空间相关性模型，并基于此识别难负样本和假阴性样本，集成到GeoCLIP框架中。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上的评估表明，显式建模空间先验能提升图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上效果更明显。

Conclusion: 通过整合空间统计工具来建模空间相关性，能够有效改进对比学习方法在图像地理定位任务中的表现。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在从单张图像预测运动方面表现不佳，特别是在简单物理场景中。这主要是因为生成像素的开销过大，而非直接建模运动。

Method: 将运动预测任务构建为条件生成密集轨迹网格，采用现代视频生成器的架构但输出运动轨迹而非像素，从而直接捕捉场景范围内的动态和不确定性。

Result: 该方法在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直观物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性，比先前的回归器和生成器产生更准确和多样化的预测。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地进行运动预测，现代视频生成器由于像素生成的开销而难以从单张图像准确预测运动。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的优缺点，为基于任务需求和可靠性约束选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估DINOv3（独立帧处理）和V-JEPA2（联合时序建模）两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette得分0.31 vs 0.21）和姿态识别动作的区分能力（6.16倍分离比）上表现更优，而V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现出更一致的可靠性（性能方差0.094 vs 0.288）。DINOv3在静态姿态识别上表现优异，但在运动依赖动作上性能下降；V-JEPA2在不同动作类别间提供更平衡的表征质量。

Conclusion: 两种架构存在基本权衡：DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别，V-JEPA2的时序建模在不同动作类别间提供更平衡的性能。研究结果为视频分析系统的架构设计选择提供了实证依据。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Conclusion: 双架构系统展示了通过自动化生成可操作、信息密集的描述来改善灾害损害评估的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production

### [42] [A Data-driven Typology of Vision Models from Integrated Representational Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21628)
*Jialin Wu,Shreya Saha,Yiqing Bo,Meenakshi Khosla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于多种表征相似性度量的方法来分析不同视觉模型家族的表示特性，发现几何和调谐特征具有家族特异性，而线性可解码信息更普遍共享。通过相似性网络融合方法实现了更好的家族分离，揭示了架构和训练目标共同塑造计算策略的模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表示特征是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用多种表征相似性度量（几何、单元调谐、线性可解码性），并采用相似性网络融合（SNF）方法整合这些互补的度量维度。

Result: 几何和调谐度量能有效区分模型家族，而线性预测性度量分离较弱。SNF方法实现了比任何单一度量更清晰的家族分离，聚类分析显示监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，但所有自监督模型跨越架构边界聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发的框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类学，表明由架构和训练目标共同塑造的新兴计算策略定义了超越表面设计类别的表示结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

*Yixiang Dai,Fan Jiang,Chiyu Wang,Mu Xu,Yonggang Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FantasyWorld是一个几何增强框架，通过为冻结的视频基础模型添加可训练的几何分支，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜空间和隐式3D场，实现3D感知的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，在空间一致性和下游3D推理任务应用方面存在限制。需要将视频想象力与3D感知相结合。

Method: 引入跨分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，形成统一主干和跨分支信息交换的框架。

Result: 实验显示FantasyWorld在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致基线，能够有效桥接视频想象与3D感知。

Conclusion: 该框架通过统一主干和跨分支信息交换获得了性能提升，几何分支的潜空间可作为下游3D任务的通用表示，无需逐场景优化或微调。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from
the unified backbone and cross-branch information exchange.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程。它能无缝处理异构的时空数据集，支持不同维度(1D-3D)、分辨率和混合标量/向量场的输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学机器学习中处理异构和多模态科学观测数据的挑战，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习提供灵活强大的骨干网络。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积、场间交叉注意力和轴向注意力，使用全模型微调和低秩适配器进行迁移学习。

Result: 在多个下游预测任务中，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化方面均优于从头训练的模型，匹配或超越了强基线和最新SOTA模型。

Conclusion: MORPH为学习科学观测数据的异构和多模态特性提供了灵活强大的解决方案，为可扩展的科学机器学习开辟了新路径。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下目标检测面临的类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等挑战。

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet骨干网络减少计算量，并设计SlideLoss损失函数动态强调欠代表和遮挡样本。

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO达到竞争性mAP和优越精度，仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，计算开销减少1.5%。

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效解决了保持高检测质量同时最小化计算成本的双重挑战，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署。

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测物体运动来更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，提升多目标跟踪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based多目标跟踪方法在单个Transformer解码器层中联合处理检测和跟踪查询，导致冲突和关联精度下降

Method: MATR显式预测跨帧物体运动来预先更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞，实现更一致的训练

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升9+点，达到71.3 SOTA；SportsMOT 72.2 HOTA；BDD100k 54.7 mTETA、41.6 mHOTA，均达到SOTA水平

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是推进多目标跟踪的简单而高效的方法

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏差直接注入网络注意力分数中，实现几何一致的对齐和特征聚合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态轻微变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界的李相对偏差，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧间的角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 李群为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性表示方法，DeLiVR通过注入李群微分偏差实现了高效且鲁棒的视频去雨。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

Motivation: 受到自然图像领域基础模型巨大成功的启发，希望将这种技术应用于SAR领域，利用自监督学习模型在有限标注数据下的适应能力、对分布偏移的鲁棒性以及特征可迁移性等优势。

Method: 首先测试现有视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR任务中的表现，然后通过自监督微调公开SSL模型与SAR数据，训练了多个AFRL-DINOv2模型。

Result: AFRL-DINOv2模型显著优于当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X，建立了新的SAR基础模型最先进性能，并在不同下游任务适应策略下分析了性能权衡。

Conclusion: 自监督微调是SAR基础模型发展的可行路径，虽然取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型的开发仍有很长的路要走。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测和合成新的UI状态，实现移动界面的动态交互模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以支持可扩展的UI测试和智能UI代理开发。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始屏幕图像和用户操作，先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型和合成数据生成提供实用价值，并为AI代理的UI导航任务规划铺平道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation

LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的新框架，用于改进群体级情感识别性能，通过多尺度场景编码和情感语义编码来增强情感表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，同时忽视了情感标签语义信息对完整理解情感的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（使用群体级情感标签通过大语言模型生成情感词典，并通过结构化情感树精炼为综合语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法取得了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的框架有效提升了群体级情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: SAM模型在医学图像分割中面临边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足和缺乏不确定性量化等挑战，需要专门针对医学影像特点的改进方案。

Method: 结合医学知识图谱编码解剖关系，使用基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测，并引入不确定性感知融合模块提升临床可靠性。

Result: 在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的Dice分数，在腹部MRI和CT分割中分别达到78.05%和79.68%的Dice分数，表现出优异的性能。

Conclusion: KG-SAM是一个稳健且可推广的医学图像分割框架，通过整合解剖学知识显著提升了分割精度和临床可靠性。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型统一处理多种任务的启发，希望将类似范式扩展到视觉领域。现有方法需要跨模态和来源的特定任务预训练，成本高且难以扩展到未见任务。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，将任务表示为视觉句子，其中上下文序列定义任务和期望输出模态。通过微调视频扩散变换器来处理各种视觉任务。

Result: 尽管仅在自然视频数据上训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像和视频组合）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为可扩展和统一的视觉建模基础，理解和生成任务可以通过简单反转视觉句子顺序来切换。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，解决了现代ViT架构中空间设计对token减少的挑战，实现了与空间架构的无缝兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用空间架构设计（如窗口注意力、分解相对位置嵌入等），这些架构对token减少提出了新挑战，因为现有方法无法保持它们依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D减少策略强制结构化token布局，空间感知合并算法保持相对token位置，以及新颖的每维度最大幅度token表示来保留显著特征。

Result: 在空间和非空间架构上均取得最先进结果：SAM-H在COCO上实现1.25倍加速仅损失0.7% mIOU，DeiT-B在ImageNet上1.15倍加速且无top-1准确率下降。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，能够保持空间完整性，与空间架构兼容，在无需微调和使用微调时都表现出强大性能。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有方法提取统一特征处理视频中的所有动作，难以在多动作场景中建模不同对象间的交互。

Method: 使用时空场景图(SSGs)和动态提示模块(DPM)引导图解析神经网络(GPNN)生成动作特定表示，并设计了视频适配的GPNN使用动态权重聚合信息。

Result: 在视频动作识别实验中，与最先进方法相比证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效解耦多动作场景中的指定动作，提升动作识别性能。

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多图像推理方面存在两个关键挑战：缺乏跨图像推理能力和不足的跨图像参考奖励建模。

Method: 采用两阶段训练范式：监督微调与图像感知强化学习优化相结合，构建轨迹数据并生成轻量级推理增强数据集，设计具有对象和图像双重奖励函数的图像感知RL策略。

Result: 在跨图像推理任务上达到64.82%的SOTA性能，比之前最佳方法提升1%。

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了多图像推理和定位问题，通过创新的训练方法和奖励设计显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Motivation: 当前视频生成方法在长序列生成中存在局限性：基于扩散的方法容易出现时间不一致和视觉漂移，而自回归方法则牺牲视觉细节。

Method: 提出动作引导的变长分块机制，根据机器人动作的语义上下文对视频进行分区；引入上下文感知的专家混合框架，在生成过程中自适应激活每个块的专用专家。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在扩展的rollouts中实现了稳定和一致的长序列生成。

Conclusion: LongScape框架能够生成高质量的长序列视频，为具身操作数据生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决现有视频生成世界模型因像素级重建引入视觉冗余而阻碍动作解码和泛化的问题，以及潜在世界模型忽略精细细节的问题。

Method: 使用混合世界模型框架，以潜在模型的运动感知表示作为高级先验，指导从像素空间模型提取精细视觉特征。

Result: 在CALVIN基准上实现了最先进的任务成功率，并展现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoWM通过融合不同特征空间的优势，为具身规划提供了有效解决方案，并揭示了各特征空间的优势特征。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

TL;DR: 提出了DiTraj框架，一种无需训练的轨迹控制方法，专门为Diffusion Transformers设计，通过前景-背景分离指导和改进的位置编码实现精确的轨迹控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专门为U-Net设计，未能充分利用DiT的优越性能，因此需要一种简单有效的训练免费框架。

Method: 使用前景-背景分离指导：LLM将用户提示转换为前景和背景提示；提出STD-RoPE位置编码，通过修改前景token的位置嵌入消除跨帧空间差异，增强轨迹控制；通过调节位置嵌入密度实现3D感知轨迹控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj是一个简单有效的训练免费框架，能够为DiT模型提供精确的轨迹控制能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Motivation: Transformer模型在问答任务中表现出色，但多跳推理（需要结合多个段落证据）仍然具有挑战性。本文旨在评估检索增强生成框架中的检索策略，以改进多跳问答性能。

Method: 比较余弦相似度、最大边际相关性和混合方法（结合稠密嵌入、词汇重叠和重排序），并采用EfficientRAG管道进行查询优化，引入令牌标记和迭代优化。

Result: 在HotpotQA数据集上，混合方法显著优于基线方法，相对余弦相似度在精确匹配和F1分数上分别提升50%和47%。错误分析显示混合检索提高了实体召回率和证据互补性。

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但现实世界常包含动态元素如移动物体和变化光照，需要同时建模时间辐射变化和LDR到HDR的复杂转换。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的HDR-4DGS架构，包含创新的动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上辐射分布的变化动态调整色调映射函数，保持时间辐射一致性。

Result: HDR-4DGS在定量性能和视觉保真度上都超越了现有最先进方法，实现了任意视角和时间点的真实感HDR渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了动态场景下的HDR新视角合成问题，实现了时间辐射一致性和空间准确的颜色转换。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Conclusion: SRHand方法能够从低分辨率图像实现详细3D手部重建，解决了现有方法在低分辨率输入和可变形物体上的局限性。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

TL;DR: 该论文认为当前AI生成图像检测研究过于关注"假"图像和生成算法，而忽略了"真实"图像的精确定义和数据收集。作者指出大多数检测方法依赖过时的低分辨率真实图像数据集，而现代智能手机拍摄的照片实际上也经过神经网络处理，与生成图像的技术类似，因此需要重新思考"真实"图像的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像生成模型的普及引发了对其负面社会影响的担忧，但当前检测方法存在根本性问题：过度关注生成算法和"假"样本，缺乏对"真实"图像的明确定义和高质量数据收集。

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，通过分析当前研究现状，指出检测方法主要依赖过时的真实图像数据集（如ImageNet），而现代智能手机拍摄的照片也经过神经网络处理，与生成图像技术相似。

Result: 分析表明当前"假"图像检测方法存在根本缺陷，因为它们基于过时的"真实"图像概念。现代摄影技术已使"真实"与"生成"的界限变得模糊。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考"真实"图像的概念，制定明确的技术定义，并创建新的基准数据集。甚至需要讨论检测"假"图像这一目标本身是否合理。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像美学评估方面具有潜力，但由于缺乏多模态美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性，难以生成准确的美学判断和可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架，包括AesCoT管道构建高质量美学推理数据用于冷启动，然后使用RAPO强化学习算法联合优化绝对评分回归和相对排序，使模型在评分前生成结构化解释。

Result: 实验表明Aes-R1将骨干模型的平均PLCC/SRCC提升了47.9%/34.8%，超越了同类规模的先进基线方法，在有限监督和分布外场景下也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Aes-R1能够在统一框架中增强美学评分和推理能力，使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可靠的评分。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

*Jibin Song,Mingi Kwon,Jaeseok Jeong,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Syncphony是一个音频到视频生成模型，通过运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，实现了与音频输入精确同步的380x640分辨率、24fps视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频主干网络，引入两个关键组件：运动感知损失（强调高运动区域学习）和音频同步引导（使用视觉对齐的非同步模型引导全模型，在推理时更好地利用音频线索）。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的同步机制成功解决了音频到视频生成中的时序控制问题，实现了高质量的音频同步视频生成。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语言引导的遥感变化检测模型LG-CD，通过自然语言提示引导网络关注感兴趣区域，显著提升变化检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的方法主要关注单模态视觉信息，忽略了文本等多模态数据提供的丰富语义信息。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型SAM2作为特征提取器获取多尺度金字塔特征，采用多层适配器微调模型，设计文本融合注意力模块对齐视觉和文本信息，通过视觉-语义融合解码器深度整合视觉和语义信息。

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD持续优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

TL;DR: 提出统一的扩散框架，结合文本和拖拽交互进行图像编辑，解决文本驱动方法缺乏空间控制和拖拽驱动方法缺乏纹理指导的互补局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状结构但缺乏细粒度纹理指导，需要整合两者的优势。

Method: 提出点云确定性拖拽增强潜在空间布局控制，以及拖拽-文本引导去噪在去噪过程中动态平衡拖拽和文本条件的影响。

Result: 方法不仅实现高保真联合编辑，还在单独文本或拖拽模式下匹配或超越专门方法的性能。

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能且可泛化的可控图像操作解决方案，支持灵活编辑模式。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Motivation: 解决北欧地区无人机图像中车辆检测面临的强能见度挑战和雪覆盖引起的域偏移问题，同时利用廉价获取的未标注数据来改进检测性能。

Method: 提出侧载对比学习适应框架：在预训练阶段通过对比学习在未标注数据上训练CNN特征提取器，在微调阶段将其侧载到冻结的YOLO11n骨干网络中，并比较不同融合方法和粒度。

Result: 在NVD数据集上，提出的侧载对比学习适应模型在mAP50指标上提升了3.8%到9.5%的检测性能。

Conclusion: 侧载对比学习适应框架能有效利用未标注数据提升车辆检测性能，特别是在具有挑战性的北欧环境条件下。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法要么需要特定模型的反转设计，要么需要大量优化，限制了利用最新图像到视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域的能力。

Method: 采用向量场校正与样本偏差来将源视频信息融入去噪过程，使用结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时间相关噪声，并通过偏差缓存机制减少计算开销。

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法，提供了轻量级的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V方法成功实现了无需反转的高质量视频编辑，为视觉创意提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法依赖完全监督学习，需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关的外观。该方法可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅达到最先进性能，而且在仅使用70%训练数据时仍能保持竞争性表现，展示了卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习有效解决了多视角计数对标注数据的依赖问题，在数据效率和性能方面都表现出色，具有很好的实用价值。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统性的基准测试，用于评估基础模型中的物体中心空间推理能力，发现检测器和视觉语言模型在空间定位与关系推理之间存在稳定权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试强调定位精度，但忽视了模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系。有效的场景理解不仅需要识别物体，还需要推理它们的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大型视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 检测器（如GroundingDINO和OWLv2）能提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而视觉语言模型（如SmolVLM和GPT-4o）能提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述，但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了定位与真正空间理解之间的差距，并指出了社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来缓解视觉上下文学习中过度依赖单个示例的问题，提高预测稳定性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉上下文学习(VICL)存在过度依赖单个上下文图像对的问题，导致预测结果存在偏差和不稳定性。

Method: 提出了基于补丁的k最近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)框架，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多个视觉任务上的实验表明，PANICL相比基线方法有持续改进，对领域偏移具有强鲁棒性，并能很好地泛化到其他VICL模型。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且广泛适用的框架，能有效解决VICL中的单示例依赖问题，提高模型性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB图像作为参考，无需深度传感器或多视角图像，通过改进深度预测和深度感知匹配技术，在挑战性表面和光照条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法依赖深度传感器，在透明或高反光表面容易失效；RGB方法在低光和无纹理场景中匹配性能不足。SingRef6D旨在解决这些实际问题，在资源受限环境下保持鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2提出token-scaler微调机制和新优化损失，提升挑战性表面的深度预测精度；2. 引入深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中有效整合空间关系，处理挑战性材质和光照条件的匹配问题。

Result: 在REAL275深度预测上相比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%（δ1.05指标）；在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计评估中，平均召回率比SOTA方法提升6.1%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D通过单RGB参考图像实现了鲁棒的6D姿态估计，在挑战性表面和光照条件下表现优异，为资源受限环境提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Motivation: 现有基于transformer解码器的基础模型计算开销大且缺乏可解释性，难以在资源受限场景中部署。

Method: 使用可训练的硬特征选择器进行稀疏操作，并将特征选择集成到提前退出机制中，通过贝叶斯优化确定最优退出阈值。

Result: 相比ViNT，DynaNav实现了2.26倍FLOPs减少、42.3%推理时间降低和32.8%内存使用减少，同时在四个公共数据集上提升了导航性能。

Conclusion: DynaNav框架通过动态特征和层选择机制，在保持导航性能的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于资源受限的视觉导航场景。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across

TL;DR: 提出SemanticControl方法，解决ControlNet在使用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件时的问题，通过自适应抑制冲突区域并强化文本引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet需要精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实际应用中，特别是对于不常见或想象场景，往往缺乏合适的视觉条件。现有的ControlNet模型难以使用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件。

Method: 运行辅助去噪过程使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示词提取注意力掩码，然后在实际目标提示词的去噪过程中利用这些掩码，自适应抑制视觉条件与文本冲突的区域。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在各种视觉条件下（深度图、边缘图、人体骨架）都能在未对齐条件下提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但未对齐的视觉条件，提高文本到图像生成的质量和保真度。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视觉情感评估框架MVEI，通过情感陈述判断任务系统评估多模态大语言模型的情感感知能力，发现模型在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面表现较好，但在理解感知主观性方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs情感感知能力的评估方法存在不足，包括忽略合理响应、情感分类有限、忽视上下文因素以及标注工作量大等问题，需要开发更有效的评估框架。

Method: 提出了情感陈述判断任务，并设计了一个自动化流程来高效构建以情感为中心的陈述，最小化人工干预。

Result: 系统评估显示MLLMs在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对有限。与人类相比，即使是表现最好的GPT4o也存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 通过开发基础评估框架并进行全面的MLLM评估，这项工作有助于推进MLLMs的情感智能发展，指出了未来改进的关键领域。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、MoE架构和强化学习的结合，有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄露和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

TL;DR: PartSAM是首个基于大规模3D数据训练的可提示部件分割模型，采用双分支编码器架构，在多个基准测试中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过从2D基础模型（如SAM）迁移监督来提升多视角掩码到3D，但无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解、不可控分解和泛化能力有限。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，基于triplane的双分支编码器生成空间结构化token；引入模型在环标注流程，从在线资源中整理超过500万个3D形状-部件对。

Result: 在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法，实现了高度准确的部件识别和自动分解表面及内部结构的能力。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型的决定性一步，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据，产生了新兴的开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的无参考图像对比度质量评估框架，通过定制和微调EfficientNet B0、ResNet18和MobileNetV2预训练架构，在对比度失真评估上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像对比度是视觉感知的基本因素，但大多数无参考图像质量评估模型难以准确评估真实世界条件下的对比度失真。

Method: 定制三个预训练架构（EfficientNet B0、ResNet18、MobileNetV2）和孪生网络模型，添加对比度感知回归头，在CID2013和CCID2014数据集上进行端到端训练。

Result: EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，超越了传统方法和其他深度基线。

Conclusion: 对比度感知的轻量级预训练网络适配能够为无参考对比度质量评估提供高性能、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感领域指代表达理解在数据稀缺场景下泛化能力差的问题，传统监督微调方法在标注数据有限时表现不佳。

Method: 采用推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式，强制模型先生成可解释的推理链来分解指代表达，然后利用这些推理结果来定位目标对象，实现"先推理后行动"的过程。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1持续且显著优于监督微调基线，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理中心的强化微调方法，有效利用了有限的标注数据，提升了模型的泛化能力和可解释性，在少样本地理空间指代表达理解任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型在医学视觉问答中的临床奉承行为，提出了一个医学奉承基准数据集和轻量级缓解策略VIPER，通过过滤非证据内容来减少模型奉承行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型越来越多地集成到临床工作流程中，但它们经常表现出奉承行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而不是基于证据的推理。

Method: 从PathVQA、SLAKE和VQA-RAD构建医学奉承数据集，使用心理学启发的压力模板，提出VIPER框架过滤非证据内容并生成基于证据的答案。

Result: 发现各种VLM模型普遍存在脆弱性，表现出显著的对抗性响应变化，与模型准确性或大小的相关性较弱。模仿和专家提供的修正被发现是最有效的触发因素。

Conclusion: VIPER框架平均减少了奉承行为，优于基线方法，同时保持可解释性，为医学VLM在真实世界临床交互中的稳健部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理模糊的注视模式和口头问题，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注视数据被整合到视觉语言模型中以便在日常场景中简化多模态查询。但利用注视数据建模用户注意力存在模糊性挑战：(1)用户口头问题因使用代词或跳过上下文而变得模糊；(2)人类注视模式嘈杂且与口头问题存在复杂时空关系。先前工作仅考虑单张图像作为视觉模态输入，无法捕捉用户注意力的动态特性。

Method: 首先分析数百个带有注视模态的查询样本以证明用户注视模式的嘈杂性；然后利用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程来处理嘈杂注视模式；最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到前沿视觉语言模型中，同时保留其预训练知识。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手的可用且直观的交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型存在空间偏见问题，当关键视觉信息位于图像不同位置时会产生不一致输出。问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计，作者提出平衡位置分配方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务上取得了显著成功，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分理解。作者旨在系统研究LVLMs的空间偏见问题。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析模型响应，发现空间不一致性问题源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。提出平衡位置分配方法，为所有图像标记分配相同的位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明BaPA方法无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升多模态基准测试性能。信息流分析显示BaPA产生更平衡的注意力分布。

Conclusion: 位置嵌入的不平衡设计是导致LVLMs空间偏见的主要原因，提出的BaPA方法能有效缓解这一问题，促进更全面的视觉理解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

Motivation: 扩散模型骨干网络已知编码了丰富的语义特征，但为了支持图像合成能力，它们也必须包含视觉特征。然而由于缺乏标注数据集，分离这些视觉特征具有挑战性

Method: 引入自动化管道构建具有标注语义和视觉对应关系的图像对，设计对比架构来分离两种特征类型，利用解耦表示提出VSM指标

Result: 经验结果表明，该方法在量化视觉不一致性方面优于CLIP、DINO和视觉语言模型等全局特征指标，同时能够对不一致区域进行空间定位

Conclusion: 这是首个支持在主题驱动生成中量化和定位不一致性的方法，为该任务的推进提供了有价值的工具

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的嵌入表示在动态模态（如音频和视频）中的应用仍未被充分探索，需要统一的表示空间来处理文本、音频和视频模态。

Method: 采用分层特征融合策略和联合多模态多任务训练方法，支持任意模态间的跨模态检索和生成提示感知的嵌入表示。

Conclusion: WAVE通过联合训练策略提升了所有模态的性能，为跨模态任意到任意应用开辟了广阔可能性。

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,

strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies

Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大。随着"图像思维"模型的出现，推理扩展到视觉领域，需要更高效的处理方法。

Method: 采用两阶段推理管道：第一阶段分析下采样图像识别相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理。使用强化学习框架开发奖励组件，实现推理驱动的感知，能够处理感知不确定性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率，同时效率更高。例如在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉token，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了视觉语言模型的效率，为高分辨率图像处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的学习型深度聚焦方法在复杂场景（如精细纹理或深度突变区域）中表现不佳，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 提出变分公式，包含空间约束和焦距约束：空间约束利用不同焦距级别的梯度模式变化区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影；焦距约束强制单峰、单调的焦点概率，符合物理焦点行为。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度准确性和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入针对深度聚焦的双重约束和归纳偏置，DualFocus在挑战性区域提高了鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Conclusion: 该工作为多智能体协作感知建立了理论基础，提出的RDcomm框架在性能与通信效率之间实现了优异平衡，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: 静态基准测试在诊断文本到图像模型的系统性失败方面能力有限，需要一种主动探索范式来全面揭示失败场景及其根本原因。

Method: 将错误发现构建为结构化搜索问题，寻找最小化、引发失败的概念，并采用新颖的加速技术使计算可行。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas为深度模型审计提供了原则性和可扩展的引擎，建立了诊断优先的方法论来指导更鲁棒的生成AI开发。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B在CHAIR上实现超过5%的幻觉减少，同时在LLaVA-NEXT-7B、Cambrian-8B和InstructBLIP-7B等架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，在保持召回率和描述丰富度的同时有效缓解幻觉，对无幻觉描述几乎不产生副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

TL;DR: CoFFT是一种无需训练的方法，通过模拟人类视觉认知来增强视觉语言模型的推理能力，包含多样化样本生成、双重前瞻解码和视觉焦点调整三个迭代阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生过多任务无关的推理过程甚至幻觉，这源于它们无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: CoFFT包含三个迭代阶段：(1)多样化样本生成：探索潜在推理路径；(2)双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展评估样本；(3)视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中使用Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next模型，性能持续提升了3.1-5.8%，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力，在保持计算效率的同时显著改善了性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to

Motivation: 面对面教学互动在教育支持和技能传递中至关重要，但计算机视觉领域对此缺乏系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和分析技术。

Method: 构建了包含语音内容、韵律、注视、身体动作和视觉上下文的多模态面对面教学数据集，并比较了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的表现。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在理解面对面教学场景方面表现出色，为全面理解教学互动提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)和流匹配(FM)等生成建模范式，在专门的分离U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成分离后的声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在解决音频-视觉声源分离任务方面具有显著效果，能够为不同声音类别产生高质量的分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频域学习方法对鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测非常有效。

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

Motivation: 现有3D重建模型无法生成资产的材质属性，这在多样化光照环境中对真实感渲染至关重要

Method: 首先微调基于深度和法线图的多视角材质扩散模型，然后探索与2D高斯泼溅对齐的高斯材质表示，建模PBR材质的各个通道

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了带有PBR材质属性的高质量3D内容，支持动态重光照，为实际渲染应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

Conclusion: 提出的自监督点云补全方法通过多视图增强和Mamba架构的引入，有效克服了现有方法的局限性，实现了优异的补全效果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在DragGAN的W+潜空间层引入PCA能持续减少总优化时间，同时保持良好的视觉质量，在较浅潜空间（W+层=3）中甚至提升了SSIM指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex

two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

### [108] [Polysemous Language Gaussian Splatting via Matching-based Mask Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22225)
*Jiayu Ding,Xinpeng Liu,Zhiyi Pan,Shiqiang Long,Ge Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义设计和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂的多概念语义；(iii)易受跨视图语义不一致影响，破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成多粒度2D掩码并提升到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组。使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，通过最具代表性视角解释对象外观，视觉语言模型提取鲁棒文本特征以协调视觉不一致，实现开放词汇查询。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟。在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中，优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: 通过完全放弃特征优化，MUSplat提供了一种高效、无需训练的方法，成功解决了现有3D语义理解方法的局限性，实现了更好的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合性基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时序变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在探索多模态大语言模型在城市环境中的性能方面存在局限，缺乏对城市环境时间演化和主观感知的系统性探索，而这些对人类感知至关重要。

Method: 通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程，从全球11个代表性城市收集多时序单视角和全景街景图像，生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进的多模态大语言模型，发现Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅为1.5%。模型在场景理解任务上表现良好，某些模型在像素级变化检测上甚至超越人类标注者，但在需要时序推理的任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解方面具有潜力，特别是在场景感知和某些主观维度上能达到或超越人类水平，但在时序推理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

TL;DR: 提出EXCL方法解决源自由无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道，在不访问源数据的情况下实现目标域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+预训练视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协同检索样本、分别微调专家、强制学习一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法通过双专家协作学习，有效解决了源自由无监督域自适应问题，在保护隐私和降低成本的同时实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑虽然质量出色，但计算延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑方法。

Method: 提出三步创新：1) 一步式反演编辑(OSIE)避免迭代过程；2) 背景保护(BG-Shield)技术选择性修改编辑区域特征；3) 稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制防止语义泄露到背景。

Result: FlashEdit在保持优异背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比现有多步方法实现超过150倍加速。

Conclusion: FlashEdit框架成功解决了扩散模型图像编辑的延迟问题，实现了高质量实时编辑，为实际应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了Neural-MedBench基准测试，专门用于评估神经学领域的多模态临床推理能力，发现现有视觉语言模型在真实临床推理任务中表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试主要关注分类准确性，导致模型看似熟练但实际在高风险诊断推理中失败，需要专门评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 开发了包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的紧凑型基准测试，涵盖鉴别诊断、病灶识别和推理生成三个核心任务，采用混合评分管道结合LLM评分、临床医生验证和语义相似度指标。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等先进模型的系统评估显示，与传统数据集相比性能急剧下降，错误分析表明推理失败而非感知错误是主要问题。

Conclusion: 提出了双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准（如Neural-MedBench）用于推理保真度，为临床可信AI提供严格且经济有效的评估。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和人工标注，而现有卫星方法存在数据遮挡、过时以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续等问题。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过创新的生成式框架有效解决了大规模地图构建中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶和导航系统提供了高效可靠的地图构建方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M：基于3D高斯溅射的统一网格重建和材质分解方法，无需外部先验即可处理高反射表面


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反射表面，且依赖外部模型先验来增强分解结果

Method: 联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失和优化过程

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，为下游任务提供三角形网格及其相关材质组件

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了网格重建和材质分解问题，无需复杂神经组件即可处理高反射表面

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了任务指令与桌面场景之间的语义鸿沟，为机器人任务训练提供了高质量的合成场景生成方案。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Motivation: 尽管DeepSeek-R1已证明基于规则的强化学习的成功，但在文档分析领域强化学习应用较少。许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行研究，考察三种不同的分布外场景：分布外图像、未见类别和不同模态。

Result: 研究发现强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，在三种不同的分布外场景中都验证了这一优势。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理分布外数据时展现出优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频模型的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害叙述分解为多个看似良性的场景来绕过安全过滤器，显著提高有害视频生成的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到视频模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益凸显。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和文本到图像模型的漏洞，但文本到视频模型的安全性尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: SceneSplit通过将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景，利用场景组合作为约束来操纵生成输出空间。每个场景对应安全的输出空间，但它们的顺序组合将空间限制到不安全区域。该方法还通过迭代场景操纵绕过安全过滤器，并使用策略库重用成功攻击模式。

Result: 在11个安全类别上对T2V模型进行评估，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构的攻击，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合近期模型预测来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外训练或微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著进展，但在使用较少神经函数评估次数或较低引导尺度时，输出仍可能显得不真实且缺乏细节。

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均值之间的差异来引导采样过程，生成更真实、细节更丰富的输出。该方法几乎不增加计算量，可无缝集成到现有扩散框架中。

Result: 实验表明HiGS在不同模型和架构下都能持续提升图像质量，使用预训练SiT模型在ImageNet 256×256无引导生成中仅用30步就达到了1.61的FID新纪录。

Conclusion: HiGS是一种即插即用的标准扩散采样增强方法，能够实现更快生成和更高保真度。

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Motivation: 解决轻量级3D医学图像分割中存在的"效率/鲁棒性冲突"问题，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异质模态时，轻量方法表示能力脆弱的问题。

Method: 采用可部署和可扩展的双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)，实现"一瞥-聚焦"原则，并引入空间解耦知识迁移(SDKT)技术。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，同时GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU吞吐量提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的双流架构和知识迁移技术，成功解决了轻量级3D医学图像分割的效率与鲁棒性平衡问题，在保持高效推理的同时显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of exemplar-based texture synthesis. We
introduce NIFTY, a hybrid framework that combines recent insights on diffusion

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个无需训练扩散变换器(DiT)的加速框架，通过三个轻量级策略头实现图像级自适应加速，采样速度提升近3倍且保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高成本微调，需要零更新基础生成器的自适应加速方案

Method: 使用三个策略头(步长跳过、缓存重用、稀疏注意力)独立决策加速策略，通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗判别器增强奖励信号

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等先进DiT骨干上，实现近3倍采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量

Conclusion: RAPID3框架成功实现了无需更新基础生成器的自适应加速，为DiT的实际部署提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

Abstract: Current Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) algorithms typically focus on
mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The
source code of this paper will be released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程设计需要从系统规范到组件实现的层次化抽象，每个层级都需要视觉理解与数学推理的结合。虽然多模态大语言模型在自然图像任务上表现出色，但从技术图表中提取数学模型的能力尚未被探索。

Method: 提出了CircuitSense基准，通过分层合成生成管道（包括基于网格的原理图生成器和自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器）创建了8000多个问题。评估了6个最先进的多模态大语言模型，涵盖闭源和开源模型。

Result: 闭源模型在组件识别和拓扑识别等感知任务上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理方面的性能低于19%，暴露了视觉解析与符号推理之间的关键差距。具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上始终获得更高准确率。

Conclusion: 数学理解在电路合成中具有基础性作用，符号推理能力是衡量工程能力的关键指标。现有模型在视觉到数学推理方面存在根本性限制。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Conclusion: 该方法能够以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于显著边界增强的方法能够生成高质量的融合边界，有效检测焦点信息，在多焦点图像融合任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文探索使用2D高斯泼溅(2DGS)作为视觉语言模型的替代视觉表示，以解决RGB图像传输和序列长度爆炸的问题，实现了90倍加速和97%GPU利用率，在保持语义能力的同时实现3-20倍输入压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型的两个结构低效问题：(i)从边缘设备传输密集RGB图像到云端能耗高、成本大；(ii)基于patch的tokenization导致序列长度爆炸，给注意力机制和上下文限制带来压力。

Method: 开发可扩展的2DGS流水线，包括结构化初始化、亮度感知剪枝和批量CUDA内核；通过轻量级泼溅感知输入主干和感知器重采样器，仅训练约7%参数来适配CLIP训练。

Result: 在DataComp子集上，GS编码器实现了有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能，输入压缩比达到3-20倍；虽然准确率目前低于RGB编码器，但建立了2DGS作为可行多模态基底的可行性。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基底，识别了架构瓶颈，为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘云学习表示开辟了路径。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

TL;DR: 提出了TDOA方法，用于处理动态输出场景的文本对抗攻击，通过聚类训练替代模型将动态输出转换为静态单输出场景，并采用最远标签目标攻击策略提高攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出场景，需要开发能够适应动态标签空间和有限模型访问的攻击方法。

Method: 使用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，并提出最远标签目标攻击策略选择与模型粗粒度标签差异最大的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上评估，单次查询最大攻击成功率达50.81%，在静态场景中最大ASR达82.68%。在生成式设置中，翻译任务性能提升达0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法在动态输出场景中有效，对大型语言模型具有强大威胁潜力，同时在静态场景和生成式任务中也达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

Conclusion: 神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像的解剖理解对自动报告生成、术中导航和器官定位至关重要，但专家标注数据稀缺限制了进展。需要利用标注参考图像来指导未标注目标图像的解释。

Method: 首先训练VLM通过参考图像和目标图像之间的相对空间推理识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的细粒度分割能力结合，实现小解剖区域的定位和像素级分割。

Result: 在四个数据集上，RAU始终优于SAM2微调基线，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLM在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的方法，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除技术主要针对扩散模型，无法适用于视觉自回归模型的下一个尺度令牌预测范式，存在安全漏洞。

Result: 实验证明该方法实现了外科手术式概念擦除，同时保持生成质量，解决了早期方法带来的语言漂移和多样性降低问题。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了自回归文本到图像生成中的安全空白，为VAR模型提供了有效的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过利用模态内交互来解决现有方法在视觉和文本模态中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，但忽视了模态内依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块的归因忽略了空间上下文，导致碎片化和噪声解释；文本模态中依赖前序标记会引入虚假激活。

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 视觉分支的MSEA（多尺度解释聚合），通过聚合多尺度输入的归因来动态调整感受野；2) 文本分支的ARC（激活排名相关性），通过测量上下文标记与当前标记的top-k预测排名对齐来抑制虚假激活。

Result: 在多个先进MLLM和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法始终优于现有可解释性方法，产生更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过有效利用模态内交互，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的可解释性，解决了现有方法在视觉和文本模态中的关键局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

TL;DR: 提出了CapRL框架，使用强化学习和可验证奖励来解决图像描述任务的主观性挑战，通过让非视觉语言模型基于描述回答问题来评估描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的图像描述模型依赖监督微调，需要昂贵的人工标注数据，导致模型记忆特定答案而缺乏泛化能力和创造性。需要克服SFT的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦管道：LVLM生成图像描述，然后由独立的非视觉LLM基于该描述回答多选题，根据回答准确率获得客观奖励。使用强化学习与可验证奖励范式。

Result: 在CapRL-5M数据集上预训练后，在12个基准测试中取得显著提升。在Prism评估框架中，性能与Qwen2.5-VL-72B相当，平均超出基线8.4%。

Conclusion: CapRL成功将RLVR应用于主观的图像描述任务，显著提升了模型性能，证明了基于效用的描述质量评估方法的有效性。

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

TL;DR: 提出FreqDebias框架，通过频率去偏解决深度伪造检测器中的光谱偏差问题，提升跨域泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器由于从有限训练数据中学习到偏差，难以泛化到新的伪造类型，特别是存在频率域的光谱偏差问题

Method: FreqDebias框架包含两个互补策略：1) Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2) 双重一致性正则化，结合局部CAM一致性和全局vMF分布一致性

Result: 大量实验表明FreqDebias显著提升了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过频率去偏有效缓解了光谱偏差，为深度伪造检测的泛化问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

TL;DR: LucidFlux是一个无需图像描述的通用图像修复框架，通过轻量级双分支条件器和自适应调制策略，在保持语义的同时恢复退化图像，在合成和真实场景基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图像修复方法在未知混合退化条件下容易过度平滑、产生幻觉或语义漂移的问题，特别是避免对图像描述的依赖。

Method: 使用大型扩散变换器(Flux.1)，引入轻量级双分支条件器注入退化输入和轻度修复代理信号，设计时间步和层级自适应调制策略，通过SigLIP特征实现无描述语义对齐。

Result: 在合成和真实场景基准测试中持续优于强大的开源和商业基线，消融研究验证了每个组件的必要性。

Conclusion: 对于大型扩散变换器，何时、何地以及如何注入条件信号——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现鲁棒且无需描述的通用图像修复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Motivation: 传统U-Net架构存在两个主要限制：(1)简单跳跃连接忽略了编码器-解码器之间的语义差距；(2)缺乏深层多尺度特征提取能力，导致难以保留细粒度细节和精确边界。

Method: 提出U-MAN架构，包含两个核心模块：渐进注意力引导特征融合(PAGF)模块替代简单跳跃连接，使用注意力机制融合编码器和解码器特征；多尺度自适应KAN(MAN)模块使网络能够自适应处理多尺度特征。

Result: 在三个公开数据集(BUSI、GLAS、CVC)上的实验表明，U-MAN优于最先进方法，特别是在定义准确边界和保留精细细节方面表现突出。

Conclusion: U-MAN通过结合注意力机制和多尺度自适应处理，有效解决了医学图像分割中的细节保留和边界精度问题，为复杂解剖结构和病理区域的分割提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving
fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical
structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two
key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Motivation: 传统模式识别模型使用为人类感知优化的预处理数据，但在自动化分析场景中这种预处理可能不是最优的。特别是在低带宽和能量受限的传感器设备中，高比特ADC数据传输效率低下，显著影响电池寿命。

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，通过学习任务特定的非线性量化函数，在原始图像物体检测和可穿戴设备的人类活动识别任务中应用可学习的量化策略。

Conclusion: 任务特定的非线性量化方法能够在显著降低数据位深度的同时保持模式识别性能，为低功耗传感器设备提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

Motivation: 传统VIF方法仅关注融合图像质量，而应用导向的VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据，数据获取成本高。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割与像素级融合分割之间的一致性，提出跨分割一致性自监督任务，并设计两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，就能超越传统VIF方法，并与有监督的分割导向方法相媲美。

Conclusion: SSVIF框架有效解决了应用导向VIF方法对标注数据的依赖问题，为分割任务提供了高质量的自监督融合方案。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

Result: 在公共数据集上生成逼真带标签图像，显著增强目标域数据并改善分割性能

Conclusion: 该统一框架能有效生成高质量跨域医学影像，提升分割模型的域适应能力

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PSTTS模块，通过空间令牌净化和时间令牌选择两阶段处理，有效去除事件数据中的时空冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件表示学习方法将事件流转换为事件帧序列时忽略了其高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致计算开销大。现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间令牌净化通过评估事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域；时间令牌选择通过评估相邻事件帧间的运动模式相似性来识别和移除冗余时间信息。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上测试，PSTTS显著提升效率：在DailyDVS-200数据集上减少FLOPs 29-43.6%，提升FPS 21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS是一个无需额外参数的即插即用模块，能够有效利用原始事件数据的时空分布特性，在事件表示学习中实现精度与效率的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

TL;DR: 提出了GCPO方法，通过识别图像生成中的关键token并进行针对性优化，仅使用30%的token就能达到比全token优化更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对所有图像token进行统一优化，但不同token对RLVR训练的贡献不同，需要识别关键token并实施有效的token级优化。

Method: 从三个角度识别关键token：因果依赖、熵诱导的空间结构、RLVR聚焦的token多样性。引入动态token级优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO仅使用30%的token就实现了比全token优化更好的性能，适用于AR模型和统一多模态模型。

Conclusion: GCPO通过识别和优化关键token，有效提升了AR视觉生成的性能，证明了token级优化策略的重要性。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

Result: 模型在典型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非典型颜色集上表现显著下降；识别出21个在所有模型中一致出现的颜色术语；发现两种命名策略：受限模型主要使用基本术语，扩展模型使用系统的明度修饰词；跨语言分析显示训练数据严重偏向英语和中文。

Conclusion: 语言模型架构显著影响颜色命名能力，独立于视觉处理能力；当前模型在颜色命名上存在局限性，特别是在非典型颜色和跨语言场景中。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了EfficientDepth系统，结合transformer架构和轻量级卷积解码器，通过双模态密度头和LPIPS损失函数实现高效的单目深度估计，在保持几何一致性和精细细节的同时显著降低计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在3D重建和视图合成中难以同时满足几何一致性、精细细节、对反射表面等现实挑战的鲁棒性以及边缘设备效率等关键要求。

Method: 结合transformer架构与轻量级卷积解码器，采用双模态密度头估计深度图，使用合成图像、真实图像和伪标签图像进行训练，实施多阶段优化策略，并引入基于LPIPS的损失函数。

Result: 实验结果表明，EfficientDepth在性能上达到或优于现有最先进模型，同时显著减少了计算资源需求。

Conclusion: EfficientDepth系统成功解决了单目深度估计中的关键挑战，在保持高质量深度估计的同时实现了计算效率的提升。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

*Zhen-Hao Wen,Yan Wang,Ji Feng,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan,Da-Wei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过利用LLM生成层次化文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间，实现精确区分并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用简单模板如"a photo of a [CLASS]"忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且CLIP仅使用最后一层特征映射，忽视了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成区分性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同层级，并根据任务需求自适应路由。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的表现，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型来检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上取得72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有方法提升12.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以检测复杂异常事件，这些事件由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义，而非孤立动作。SSL方法能建模低层次时空模式但缺乏语义理解，LLM有强大推理能力但计算昂贵且缺乏细粒度空间定位

Method: 提出HyCoVAD混合模型：1）基于nnFormer的多任务SSL时序分析器，通过多个代理任务识别可疑异常帧；2）LLM验证器，对选定帧应用结构化、基于规则的推理来验证异常存在

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线方法提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量

Conclusion: HyCoVAD有效结合了SSL的时空建模能力和LLM的语义推理能力，为复杂视频异常检测提供了高效解决方案，并发布了交互异常分类法、自适应阈值协议和代码

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JanusVLN提出了一种新颖的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了现有方法的空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），存在空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀等问题，阻碍了高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出了双隐式神经记忆方法。

Method: 扩展MLLM以整合来自空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力。构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆，仅保留初始和滑动窗口中的token KV，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: 在广泛实验中，JanusVLN超越了20多种最新方法，达到SOTA性能。与使用多种数据类型输入的方法相比，成功率提高了10.5-35.5；与使用更多RGB训练数据的方法相比，成功率提高了3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 提出的双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpikeMatch是首个针对脉冲神经网络(SNNs)的半监督学习框架，利用SNNs的时间动态特性进行多样化伪标签生成，在有限标签下实现高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络因其生物合理性和能效优势受到关注，但与人工神经网络相比，SNNs的半监督学习方法研究不足，需要专门针对SNN特性的SSL框架。

Method: SpikeMatch利用SNNs的泄漏因子时间动态特性，在协同训练框架内进行多样化伪标签生成。通过单个SNN的多个预测一致性，从弱增强的无标签样本生成可靠伪标签，用于训练强增强样本。

Result: 实验表明，SpikeMatch在各种标准基准测试中优于现有适应SNN骨干的SSL方法。

Conclusion: SpikeMatch成功证明了利用SNNs时间动态特性进行半监督学习的有效性，为SNNs在有限标签场景下的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和质量的挑战：扩散模型效率低，因果注意力AR模型在长视频上质量下降，以及交互式生成中视觉一致性和语义连贯性的需求。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制、流式长调优、短窗口注意力与帧级注意力汇聚，在32GPU天内将13亿参数的短片段模型微调至分钟级生成。

Result: 在单个NVIDIA H100上实现20.7FPS，在VBench上短长视频均表现优异，支持单GPU上240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理仅有轻微质量损失。

Conclusion: LongLive通过创新的架构设计成功平衡了长视频生成的效率、质量和交互性需求，为实时动态内容创作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

TL;DR: SPARK是一个高效的协同进化框架，通过回收RLVR中的rollouts和正确性数据来同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，无需单独奖励模型或人类偏好数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信息的问题，实现更高效的强化学习训练。

Method: 在RLVR基础上，回收rollouts和正确性数据，使用点对奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等目标来训练模型自我评估和改进。

Result: SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，8个通用基准上提升1.5%，表现出稳健性和广泛泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPARK通过协同进化循环实现了显著性能提升，支持无需外部奖励模型的自反思测试时扩展，为LLM和LVLM训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些场景通常受计算能力限制。立体图像对提供了一种有效的深度估计解决方案，但获取可靠的真实深度数据困难，因此需要自监督技术。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进地面实况和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上都达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与效率的良好平衡，为计算受限场景提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and

TL;DR: UML-CoT是一个利用统一建模语言（UML）的结构化推理和规划框架，通过类图和活动图生成符号思维链和可执行动作计划，在杂乱房间清洁场景中优于非结构化CoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性有限；现有结构化CoT方法仅建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有顺序或条件规划的标准语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流；采用三阶段训练管道，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，在具身推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

Motivation: 解决小样本图像分类中标记样本有限的问题，避免现有方法需要大量模型微调或外部信息源的依赖。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案独立控制正负图像条件，采用类相似性采样策略选择对比样本，构建无需模型微调的简单流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进或相当的性能，无需生成模型适应或依赖外部工具进行标题生成和图像过滤。

Conclusion: 通过正负引导的双重图像提示生成类判别特征，特别是在细粒度分类任务中表现出色，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Motivation: 重新审视VAR模型，发现其与扩散模型的理论等价性，旨在将扩散模型的优势(如迭代精炼)引入自回归视觉生成，解决VAR的架构效率问题。

Method: 通过马尔可夫注意力掩码将VAR重新解释为离散扩散模型(SRDD)，直接引入扩散模型的迭代精炼能力，减少架构冗余。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，基于扩散视角的VAR实现了更快的收敛、更低的推理成本、改进的零样本重建能力，并在效率和生成质量上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 建立了自回归变换器与扩散模型之间的理论桥梁，证明了扩散视角能有效提升VAR的性能和效率，为视觉生成模型提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RefAM框架，无需训练或架构修改，直接利用扩散变换器的注意力特征进行指代分割，在零样本图像和视频分割基准上达到新SOTA


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指代分割方法通常需要微调或多模型组合，而大规模生成扩散模型编码了丰富的语义信息，可作为通用特征提取器

Method: 利用扩散变换器的注意力分数，识别并处理停止词作为注意力磁铁和全局注意力汇，提出注意力重分配策略，开发无需训练的RefAM框架

Result: 在零样本指代图像和视频分割基准上持续超越先前方法，无需微调或额外组件

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力特征可直接用于下游任务，通过适当的注意力处理策略可实现强大的零样本性能

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

### [160] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型架构，通过投影融合块和差分特征学习机制来检测语言模型幻觉，发现幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，仅需1%的特征维度即可保持检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型幻觉检测中幻觉信号在隐藏层中精确定位不明确的问题，限制高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块进行自适应层间特征加权，以及差分特征学习机制通过计算并行编码器差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上取得显著准确率提升，发现幻觉信号集中在稀疏特征子集中，仅需1%特征维度即可维持检测性能。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设的更集中，为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可在保持准确性的同时降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Contextual Influence Value (CI值)作为上下文质量评估新指标，通过衡量移除每个上下文导致的性能下降来量化质量，无需复杂超参数调优，显著提升RAG性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法因检索到的上下文质量差（包含不相关或噪声信息）而效果受限，现有上下文选择方法未能充分利用查询、上下文列表和生成器的综合信息进行质量评估。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新定义为推理时数据估值问题，引入CI值指标；开发参数化代理模型预测CI值，采用分层架构捕捉局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互，通过CI值监督和端到端生成器反馈进行训练。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值提供了一种全面评估上下文质量的有效方法，通过简单保留正CI值的上下文即可实现高效上下文选择，显著提升RAG系统性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出最大有效上下文窗口概念，发现实际有效上下文窗口远小于厂商宣称的最大上下文窗口，且随问题类型变化，大多数模型在1000个token内准确率就严重下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试大语言模型上下文窗口的实际使用效果，验证厂商宣称的最大上下文窗口是否真实有效。

Method: 定义最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定测试方法评估不同大小和问题类型下上下文窗口的有效性，创建标准化比较模型效能的方法。

Result: 收集数十万个数据点，发现最大有效上下文窗口与宣称的最大上下文窗口存在显著差异，大多数模型在1000个token内准确率严重下降，所有模型都远未达到其宣称的最大上下文窗口。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口随问题类型变化，这为提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了明确可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在不同语言间的道德判断存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题，需要更具文化意识的AI系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs主要基于英语数据训练，但在多语言多文化环境中部署时，其道德推理能力是否能跨语言和文化泛化存在关键担忧。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型学上多样化的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，通过精心设计的研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLMs在不同语言间的道德判断存在显著不一致性，往往反映文化错位，并通过案例研究揭示预训练数据在塑造LLMs道德指南针中的作用。

Conclusion: 提出了一个结构化的道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中的表现，使用符合ADA标准的合成病例进行测试，结果显示与临床标准高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难。利用大型语言模型提供结构化、可解释的决策支持，帮助临床医生和患者。

Method: 使用基于ADA 2025标准和公共数据集（NHANES、Pima Indians等）的合成病例构建模拟框架，测试GPT-5在症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查等五个场景的表现。

Result: GPT-5在糖尿病分类、临床推理、患者解释和结构化输出方面与ADA标准高度一致。

Conclusion: GPT-5可作为临床医生和患者的双重工具，同时强调了在医疗领域负责任评估LLM的可重复评估框架的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了在减轻语言模型性别刻板印象时，公平性目标与下游任务性能之间的权衡机制，发现当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究道德对齐过程中性能下降的根本机制，特别是在减轻性别刻板印象时，公平性目标如何影响下游任务性能。

Method: 通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角，分析性能权衡的底层机制，考察选择性遗忘刻板印象对整体遗忘水平的影响。

Result: 发现下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘；通用的减轻遗忘方法对减少整体遗忘无效，也无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，需要更有效的方法来平衡道德对齐与任务性能。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

Motivation: 开发能够整合组织特定知识的定制推理模型，解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的RLVR设置下。

Method: 采用简单通用的训练方法：精心选择提示和模型，使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热阶段，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，首次提交即达到私有测试集的最先进准确率：73.56%（无自一致性）和75.68%（有自一致性），且后者需要更少的生成次数。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简单性使其广泛适用于企业领域，如商业智能、数据科学和编程。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [168] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在RLVR中使用混合token生成(MoT-G)方法，通过保留token概率分布的丰富信息来改进语言模型的推理能力，相比标准解码方法在多个推理任务上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理步骤中采样离散token，丢弃了模型在候选token上的概率分布信息，这限制了推理搜索空间。MoT-G旨在利用这些分布信息来改进推理性能。

Method: 提出了统一的MoT-G框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间中生成思维链，包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入加权和的训练无关方法。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码取得5-35%的提升(10个任务中的7个)，且用一半轨迹数达到可比精度，表明训练效率提高。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进token空间探索来提升推理性能，为RLVR方法提供了更有效的连续空间推理框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD)方法，在训练时使用推理头监督教师推理过程，推理时仅用分类头，实现准确率提升同时保持高推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提升分类准确率的同时引入显著推理吞吐量惩罚的问题，需要在准确率和效率之间找到平衡。

Method: 为仅解码器语言模型添加两个头：(i)池化分类头用于训练和推理，(ii)推理头仅在训练时使用教师推理进行监督。使用标签交叉熵和输入加推理序列的token级LM损失的加权和作为损失函数。

Result: 在七个SuperGLUE任务上，DHRD相比池化基线获得0.65-5.47%的相对提升，在蕴含/因果任务上提升更显著。推理时禁用推理头，推理吞吐量与池化分类器匹配，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法有效解决了CoT提示的准确率-吞吐量权衡问题，在保持高推理效率的同时显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验发现，代码的结构特性比语义特性对提升LLM推理能力更重要，适当的抽象（如伪代码）和保持表面规律性都能有效提升模型性能，不同编程语言在不同任务上有特定优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索代码的哪些方面（结构或语义）对提升大语言模型的推理能力最为关键，为设计训练数据提供指导。

Method: 构建十种编程语言的并行指令数据集，应用受控扰动来选择性破坏代码的结构或语义特性，在五个模型家族和八个规模上进行了3,331次实验。

Result: LLM对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感；伪代码等抽象形式与代码效果相当；即使代码被破坏，只要表面规律性保持，性能仍具竞争力；不同编程语言在不同任务上表现各异。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性对LLM推理能力提升更为关键，适当的抽象和保持表面规律性可有效提升性能，编程语言选择应根据具体任务需求。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索说话人日志系统在非洲口音英语中，特别是在临床对话领域的性能差异，以识别和解决领域特定挑战。

Method: 方法包括评估多个生产和开源系统，使用严格的DER协议评分重叠，进行错误分析，并通过在口音匹配数据上微调分割模块进行轻量级领域适应。

Result: 结果显示临床对话存在一致的领域惩罚，主要归因于误报和漏检，与短轮次和频繁重叠相关。轻量级适应减少了误差但未消除差距。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要重叠感知的分割和平衡的临床资源作为实际下一步，同时提供了跨领域基准、错误分解方法和易于复现的适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律、学术和金融中，可信赖的LLM必须引用可验证的来源，因为即使是小错误也可能带来严重后果。

Method: 引入了两种引用范式：G-Cite（在解码时同时生成答案和引用）和P-Cite（先起草答案再附加引用），并在四个流行的归属数据集上进行了从零样本到高级检索增强方法的全面评估。

Result: 结果显示覆盖率和引用正确性之间存在一致的权衡，检索是两种范式中归属质量的主要驱动因素。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争力的正确性和中等延迟，而G-Cite方法以覆盖率和速度为代价优先考虑精确度。

Conclusion: 推荐采用检索为中心、P-Cite优先的方法用于高风险应用，保留G-Cite用于严格声明验证等精度关键场景。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

TL;DR: ComPSum是一个个性化多文档摘要框架，通过比较用户偏好与其他用户偏好的细粒度差异来生成个性化摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要识别用户偏好的细粒度差异，通过比较不同用户的偏好来实现有效个性化。

Method: ComPSum首先通过比较给定用户偏好与其他用户偏好生成结构化分析，然后使用该分析指导个性化摘要生成。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估框架，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好差异的结构化分析可以有效指导个性化摘要生成，ComPSum框架在个性化多文档摘要任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，用于解决单样本、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化问题，在真实、多视角、低质量图像的规划基准上评估，发现VLM形式化方法显著优于端到端规划生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长时程规划任务中表现不佳。文本领域通过将规划问题转化为形式化语言（如PDDL）并使用形式化求解器取得了显著进展，但在多模态环境中，VLM作为形式化器的研究仍然稀缺。

Method: 开发了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，支持单样本、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化。在现有基准基础上提出了两个新基准，首次考虑了真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划问题。

Result: VLM作为形式化器的方法在规划性能上显著优于端到端规划生成。研究发现瓶颈在于视觉而非语言能力，因为VLM经常无法捕捉到必要的对象关系的完整集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）可以部分弥补性能不足。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器在多模态规划中具有显著优势，但视觉能力仍是主要瓶颈。中间文本表示提供了部分性能补偿，但其不一致的增益为未来多模态规划形式化研究留下了改进空间。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现尽管语法正确，但文化适应性仍存在明显不足，需要大量人工修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准主要关注语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽略了文化适应性和整体本地化质量这些实际应用中的关键因素。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电商营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种方言变体，由母语者提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 领先模型通常能产生语法正确的翻译，但在处理文化细微语言方面表现不佳，即使是高资源语言也经常误译比喻表达和文字游戏。

Conclusion: 挑战了数据量是机器翻译质量最可靠预测因子的假设，提出文化适应性是多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，当前学术和行业基准对此关注不足。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

TL;DR: OjaKV是一个KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间适应来减少长上下文推理的内存瓶颈，保持高压缩比下的零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，现有静态压缩方法在数据分布变化时性能不佳。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留首尾关键token作为锚点，对中间token使用Oja算法进行在线PCA低秩压缩，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持甚至提升零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的超长上下文基准测试中表现最佳，与FlashAttention等现代注意力模块完全兼容。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个无需模型微调的即插即用解决方案，为内存高效的长上下文推理提供了实用框架。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over

work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion

for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中需要持续更新输出的挑战，避免重复从头生成输出，同时控制计算成本以满足延迟要求。

Method: 使用最近输出作为当前增长输入上下文的草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，结合display-only mask-k技术减少闪烁。

Result: 在同时文本重翻译任务中实现1.7倍加速，质量无损失，闪烁减少80%。

Conclusion: 该方法为延迟敏感的流式应用提供了模型无关、即插即用的加速解决方案，无需草稿计算，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景中表现不佳，需要音频工具如噪声抑制、源分离等支持，但当前模型缺乏这些能力。

Method: 开发了Thinking-with-Sound框架，结合语言推理和实时音频域分析，使模型能够主动对音频信号进行数值分析和数字处理。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升了模型鲁棒性，小型模型准确率提升24.73%，大型模型提升36.61%。

Conclusion: 音频链式思维无需重新训练即可显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更强大的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

TL;DR: SynerGen是一个生成式推荐模型，通过单一生成式主干网络统一个性化搜索和推荐，同时优化检索和排序任务，解决了传统检索-排序管道的校准问题和工程开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的检索-排序管道存在校准问题和工程开销，而现有生成式模型在统一个性化搜索和推荐方面存在性能权衡。需要开发一个能同时优化检索和排序的单一生成式模型。

Method: 使用基于行为序列训练的仅解码器Transformer，结合InfoNCE损失进行检索优化和混合点对-配对损失进行排序优化，并提出了时间感知旋转位置嵌入来整合时间信息。

Result: 在广泛采用的推荐和搜索基准测试中，相比强大的生成式推荐器和联合搜索推荐基线，SynerGen取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了单一生成式基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

*Han Yuan,Yue Zhao,Li Zhang,Wuqiong Luo,Zheng Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响，发现大多数情况下结构化输出没有因果影响，而粗粒度指标可能产生误导性结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估方法存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制不足、依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，在七个公共任务和一个开发推理任务上应用因果推断方法进行分析。

Result: 在48个场景中，43个显示结构化输出没有因果影响；剩余5个中，3个涉及由具体指令影响的多方面因果结构。粗粒度指标报告了正、负或中性影响。

Conclusion: 因果推断揭示了结构化输出对LLM生成的实际影响比粗粒度指标显示的更为复杂和有限，强调了在评估时需要更精细的分析方法。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: 提出了CARB基准来评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR来改进文化感知奖励建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估，需要填补文化相关评估数据集的空白，以推进LLM的全球对齐。

Method: 构建CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域，提出Think-as-Locals方法使用RLVR来激发生成式奖励模型的文化推理能力。

Result: 评估显示现有奖励模型在文化意识建模方面存在不足，CARB性能与下游多语言文化对齐任务正相关，Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准揭示了奖励模型文化意识的缺陷，Think-as-Locals方法通过结构化评估标准和可验证奖励提升了文化感知奖励建模的效果。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

*Qianen Zhang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在同步机器翻译中扩展动作空间，引入四种自适应动作（句子切割、删除、部分摘要和代词化），在LLM框架中实现，显著提升了翻译质量和延迟表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统同步机器翻译的READ/WRITE动作无法充分应对实时约束，需要更丰富的动作空间来实现实时重构、省略和简化，同时保持语义保真度。

Method: 在仅解码器的大语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作，通过动作感知提示构建训练参考，并开发延迟感知的TTS流水线来评估质量和延迟。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善语义指标（如COMET-KIWI），并实现比参考翻译和基于salami的基线更低的延迟（通过平均滞后测量）。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为弥合人机口译差距提供了有前景的方向，特别是DROP和SENTENCE_CUT的组合在流畅性和延迟之间达到了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈方法解决MLU中的数据集偏差问题，提升OOD泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于"学习注意力"的方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致分布外泛化性能下降

Method: 使用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；通过参数化掩码生成器将多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；引入工具变量约束和反事实调整来稳定因果估计

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务上，包括OOD测试集，实验证明了CaMIB的有效性

Conclusion: CaMIB模型通过因果原则而非传统似然方法，有效缓解了数据集偏差问题，具有良好解释性和稳健性

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Result: LLM在大多数谜题类型上表现优于人类，但在文字系统和未充分研究语言的谜题上表现较差。自动化谜题生成有望扩大语言学兴趣并推广稀有语言知识。

Conclusion: 语言学谜题生成作为一个研究任务具有重要意义，不仅能促进语言学发展，还能支持稀有和未充分研究语言知识的传播。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ResT方法，通过基于熵的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，解决工具使用任务中训练效率低的问题，在BFCL和API-Bank基准上达到最先进结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习框架在优化LLM工具使用策略时，仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，缺乏对工具使用任务特殊性的考虑，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低。

Method: 建立策略熵与训练稳定性之间的理论联系，提出ResT方法，通过熵感知的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank基准测试中，ResT比先前方法提升高达8.76%。在4B基础LLM上微调后，在单轮任务上超过GPT-4o 4.11%，在多轮基础任务上超过1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的token级策略梯度，实现了从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑转变，在多轮工具使用任务中稳定收敛，显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

*Duncan Soiffer,Steven Kolawole,Virginia Smith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于语义一致性的级联系统，通过模型输出的语义共识来判断可靠性，实现成本降低40%、延迟减少60%的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统在开放文本生成中面临根本挑战：当生成质量处于连续谱且存在多个有效响应时，难以确定输出可靠性。

Method: 使用语义一致性作为训练无关的延迟信号，当多样化模型输出在语义层面达成共识时，将其作为比词元级置信度更强的可靠性指标。

Result: 在500M到70B参数模型上的评估显示，语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟减少高达60%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，为实际LLM部署提供了实用基准。

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在专业模型的深度分析和大型语言模型的生成流畅性之间存在核心权衡，需要一种能同时兼顾两者的解决方案。

Method: TRACE框架将共情任务分解为分析和合成两个阶段，通过构建全面理解再进行生成，将深度分析与表达性生成相结合。

Conclusion: 结构化分解是创建更强大、更可解释的共情代理的有前景范式。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注单轮对话，缺乏对知识密集型领域多轮长形式问答的系统评估，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 构建KnowMT-Bench基准，采用动态评估设置让模型生成多轮对话历史，使用人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验显示多轮上下文会降低性能：事实能力因自生成历史的上下文噪声而下降，信息效率随对话长度增加而降低。检索增强生成能有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准对于评估和增强LLM在现实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要一种非线性扩展来提升性能。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级非线性变换，并引入基于正弦的激活函数Sinter。

Result: 在摘要和分类任务上的实验表明，LoRAN始终优于QLoRA，Sinter在消融研究中优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LUMINA是一个检测RAG系统中幻觉的新框架，通过量化外部上下文利用和内部知识利用来检测幻觉，无需大量超参数调优，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统即使提供了正确且充分的上下文，LLM仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演化测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比现有方法AUROC提升高达13%。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持稳健，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注响应正确性不同的提示，忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示，而这些提示实际上也能提供有意义的学习反馈。

Method: RL-ZVP直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，正确时给予奖励，错误时给予惩罚，无需对比不同响应，并通过标记级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富的细微信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61个百分点，通过率提升7.77个百分点，且持续优于过滤零方差提示的其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 零方差提示在RLVR中具有未被发掘的学习潜力，RL-ZVP证明了从这类提示中学习的有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

TL;DR: QoNext框架将网络和多媒体领域的体验质量(QoE)原则应用于基础模型评估，通过识别影响用户体验的因素并构建预测模型，实现主动和细粒度的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型评估方法仅关注输出正确性，忽略了用户交互体验的重要性，无法捕捉用户满意度的形成机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的因素，在受控实验中收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型来估计感知用户体验。

Result: QoNext框架能够实现主动和细粒度的评估，并为产品化服务提供优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: 将QoE原则应用于基础模型评估是可行的，QoNext框架能够更全面地评估用户体验，为实际应用提供有价值的指导。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

Method: 引入EMoE训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中协作，并鼓励路由器进行高质量选择，确保在不同计算预算下的鲁棒性能，且不增加训练开销。

Result: 实验表明EMoE显著扩展了有效性能扩展范围，可达训练时k值的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能推向更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE解决了MoE模型推理时扩展专家数量的性能下降问题，通过促进专家协作和路由器优化，实现了更广泛的性能可扩展性。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对土耳其语等黏着性语言的引用意图分类问题，提出了系统化方法并创建了首个土耳其语引用意图数据集，通过DSPy框架自动化提示优化，结合堆叠泛化集成方法实现了91.3%的最新准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解引用意图对学术研究评估至关重要，但土耳其语等黏着性语言在此任务上面临独特挑战，现有方法效果有限。

Method: 创建土耳其语引用意图数据集，使用DSPy框架自动化提示优化，采用堆叠泛化集成方法结合XGBoost元模型进行最终分类。

Result: 提出的集成方法实现了91.3%的最新准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法。

Conclusion: 本研究为土耳其NLP社区提供了基础数据集和鲁棒分类框架，为未来定性引用研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

### [203] [AutoSCORE: Enhancing Automated Scoring with Multi-Agent Large Language Models via Structured Component Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21910)
*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自动评分系统面临准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等挑战，阻碍了其在评估实践中的应用。

Method: 使用两个智能体：评分标准组件提取智能体从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分智能体基于此分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上，AutoSCORE相比单智能体基线持续提高了评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE），特别是在复杂多维评分标准和小型LLM上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多智能体设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出SimulSense框架，通过模拟人类口译员感知意义单元的方式，在连续读取语音输入的同时触发写入决策，实现更好的质量-延迟权衡和实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SimulST系统需要专门的交错训练数据和计算昂贵的大语言模型推理，缺乏人类口译员般的自然读写决策能力。

Method: 提出SimulSense框架，通过连续读取输入语音并在感知到新意义单元时触发写入决策来产生翻译，模仿人类口译员的工作方式。

Result: 与两个最先进的基线系统相比，该方法实现了更优的质量-延迟权衡，决策速度比基线快9.6倍。

Conclusion: SimulSense框架能够有效模拟人类口译员的读写决策过程，在保持翻译质量的同时显著提升实时效率。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统评估了思维链提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现86.3%的大语言模型在临床任务中使用CoT时性能下降，揭示了CoT在提升可解释性的同时可能损害临床可靠性的悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索思维链提示在临床文本理解中的有效性，因为临床领域对准确性和透明推理有严格要求，而EHR数据通常冗长、碎片化且嘈杂，CoT在此类任务中的表现尚未得到系统研究。

Method: 在87个真实世界临床文本任务上评估95个先进LLM，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学概念对齐和错误模式，结合LLM作为评判和临床专家评估。

Result: 与在其他领域的发现相反，86.3%的模型在CoT设置下性能持续下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱模型性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: CoT在临床文本任务中增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性，揭示了临床推理策略的悖论，强调了开发透明可信方法的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

*Kasidit Sermsri,Teerapong Panboonyuen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了ThaiFACTUAL框架，一个轻量级、模型无关的校准方法，用于缓解泰语政治立场检测中的偏见问题，无需微调即可减少情感泄漏和实体偏好等系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低资源和文化复杂环境中，LLMs在政治立场检测时存在系统性偏见，特别是在泰语政治语境中，由于间接语言、极化人物以及情感与立场交织的特点，这些偏见影响了模型的公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于推理的监督方法，将情感与立场解耦，并减少偏见。同时发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集，包含立场、情感、推理和偏见标记。

Result: 实验结果表明，ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并提高了多个LLMs的公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏技术的重要性，为低资源语言的政治立场检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，通过整合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话来增强LLM的学术创意生成能力，解决思想落地和确认偏误问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术创意生成方面潜力巨大，但面临思想落地困难和确认偏误的挑战，需要改进以支持进一步的创意精炼。

Method: 整合动机知识图谱（MotivGraph）和Q驱动的苏格拉底创意生成器。MotivGraph结构化存储问题、挑战和解决方案三种节点类型，为LLM创意过程提供动机基础。创意生成器是采用苏格拉底提问的双代理系统，通过严格精炼过程减轻确认偏误。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在基于LLM的评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过提供基础支持和实用的创意改进步骤，显著提升了LLM创意生成的新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性维度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

*Seongho Joo,Kyungmin Min,Jahyun Koo,Kyomin Jung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLMs内部状态，但在API受限和外部资源有限的情况下，急需建立有效的黑盒检测方法。

Method: 通过研究LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现事实性回答会产生一致响应，而非事实性回答则不一致，基于此提出黑盒检测指标。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比使用LLMs内部知识的基线方法更能预测模型响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法有效且实用，为受限环境下的幻觉检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch提出了一种新颖的图检索增强生成方法，通过双通道检索策略和模块化框架解决现有GraphRAG方法检索浅层和结构数据利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：检索浅层无法发现所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据利用效率低，阻碍了复杂查询的有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用代理深度搜索工作流程，包含六个模块的模块化框架，支持多轮交互和迭代推理。采用双通道检索策略，在基于块文本数据上执行语义查询，在结构图数据上执行关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续优于传统策略。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向，通过全面利用文本和图数据的互补优势来提高推理能力。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

Motivation: 探讨异常值在主题建模中是否不仅仅是噪声，而是新兴主题的早期信号，特别是在动态新闻语料库中。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集上追踪异常值的演化过程，重点关注企业社会责任和气候变化主题。

Result: 结果显示异常值倾向于随时间演化成连贯的主题，这一模式在两种模型和语言中保持一致。

Conclusion: 异常值在动态新闻语料库中可以作为新兴主题的早期弱信号，这一发现对主题建模和新兴趋势检测具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative
clustering approach, we track their evolution over time in French and English
news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent
topics over time across both models and languages.

Conclusion: TACOS分类法为临床聊天机器人提供了更全面和细粒度的安全框架，解决了现有方法在临床领域中的局限性。

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理具有歧义、多义或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 引入模糊推理链（FRC）框架，整合LLM语义先验与连续模糊隶属度，实现概率推理与模糊隶属推理的显式交互。

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理过程，并促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移。

Conclusion: FRC为管理细微和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有更好的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有AIGT检测数据集主要关注静态场景，而社交媒体内容受用户参与驱动且随时间演变，需要研究其时间动态和用户互动模式。

Method: 构建了5年纵向数据集RedNote-Vibe，并提出基于心理语言学特征的PLAD检测框架，该框架具有可解释性。

Result: PLAD实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了人类与AI生成内容的区分特征，并发现了语言特征与社交媒体参与度之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AIGT分析提供了重要工具，有助于理解AIGT的时间动态和用户互动模式。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET质量评估分类法，旨在解决NLP评估中质量标准名称不一致的问题，通过创建标准化的质量准则名称和定义来建立评估间的可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域中相同质量标准名称（如流畅性）在不同评估中可能衡量不同的质量方面，这种名称暗示的可比性具有误导性，阻碍了基于多个独立评估得出可靠系统质量结论的能力，影响了整个领域的科学进展。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准化的质量准则名称和定义，并将其组织成层次结构，其中每个父节点捕捉其子节点的共同方面。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，该分类法能够建立现有评估的可比性、指导新评估的设计以及评估监管合规性。

Conclusion: QCET为解决NLP评估中可比性不明确的问题提供了系统化解决方案，通过标准化质量准则定义促进了领域内评估结果的有效比较和科学进展。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了微调不适合模型编辑的传统观点，指出失败原因在于采用了错误的深度优先流水线。通过恢复标准的广度优先微调流程和优化调参位置，提出的LocFT-BF方法在模型编辑任务中大幅超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观念，认为失败源于采用了不合适的深度优先流水线，而非微调本身的问题。

Method: 恢复标准的广度优先（基于epoch）微调流程，采用小批量优化，并通过系统分析调参位置，提出LocFT-BF局部编辑方法。

Result: LocFT-BF在多种LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有最先进方法，首次实现10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的持续编辑，且不牺牲通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清长期误解并引入原则性局部调优策略，将微调从被低估的基线方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

*Dmitriy Shopkhoev,Denis Makhov,Magauiya Zhussip,Ammar Ali,Stamatios Lefkimmiatis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知优化实现更好的模型保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于严格，导致模型精度明显下降，需要更灵活的压缩策略。

Method: 使用稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的结构化稀疏分解，基于校准数据集优化分解以最小化功能重建误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在准确性和困惑度方面均优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的强大替代方案，可实现高效的大语言模型部署。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了Dialogue Act Script (DAS)框架，通过结构化对话行为表示生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译造成的文化不自然问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法常依赖英语对话翻译，这会引入人为痕迹，降低自然度和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示框架，从抽象意图表示编码、定位和生成多语言对话，而非直接翻译对话语句。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面优于机器和人工翻译。

Conclusion: DAS框架能够生成更流畅、自然的跨语言对话，有效缓解翻译腔问题，提高文化适宜性。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Solve-to-Judge (S2J)方法来解决生成奖励模型中的solve-to-judge差距问题，通过同时利用模型的求解和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现生成奖励模型存在显著的solve-to-judge差距：模型能够解决某些问题，但却无法对这些相同问题做出正确判断（14%-37%的差距）。这限制了模型的判断能力发展。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM输出上同时利用求解和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中显式连接问题求解和评估能力，从而缩小差距。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的solve-to-judge差距，将模型判断性能提升了5.8%。在相同基础模型上实现了SOTA性能，且使用更小的训练数据集，通过自进化实现而不依赖外部模型蒸馏。

Conclusion: S2J方法成功解决了生成奖励模型中的solve-to-judge差距问题，通过连接求解和判断能力显著提升了模型性能，为GRM优化提供了有效途径。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展(TTS)的方法，通过训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)来选择最佳推理路径，以解决大语言模型在事实核查复杂数值声明时面临的推理漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在事实核查真实世界声明时，特别是涉及数值推理的复杂声明时，存在理解数值细微差别和推理漂移的问题，导致推理过程误解和回溯。

Method: 采用测试时计算扩展(TTS)策略，从大语言模型中引出多个推理路径，并训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)来选择可能得出正确结论的推理路径。同时引入自适应机制，根据声明的感知复杂性选择性执行TTS以提高计算效率。

Result: TTS方法显著缓解了推理漂移问题，在事实核查数值声明方面带来显著性能提升。自适应TTS方法比标准TTS效率提高1.8倍，相比单次声明验证方法性能提升18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型选择能够有效提升大语言模型在复杂数值声明事实核查任务中的性能，同时自适应机制确保了计算效率的优化。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律条文预测方法面临重大挑战：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测场景中表现不佳，且大多数方法缺乏跨法域的通用性。

Method: 提出Uni-LAP通用框架，通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM的优势：SCM使用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM采用三段论推理来精炼最终预测。

Result: 在多法域数据集上的实证结果表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线，展示了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架成功解决了法律条文预测中的关键挑战，通过整合不同模型的优势实现了更好的性能和跨法域通用性。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: 系统回顾了31个模型和21个基准测试，涵盖编码器专用和生成式架构，分析训练方法和评估方法。

Result: 发现三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法强调语义一致性，近期工作开始纳入文化基础内容；识别出跨语言能力差异以及训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。

Conclusion: 当前多语言视觉语言模型在语言中立性和文化意识之间存在张力，训练方法偏向中立性而评估方法主要关注语义一致性，需要更好的平衡和更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型和定制领域特定模型/系统无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域进行优化。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到多个本体（FoodOn、SNOMED-CT、Hansard分类法），并对模型进行微调。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought提示方法在大型语言模型中存在的延迟高、内存占用大以及错误传播问题，寻求在推理效率和透明度之间的平衡。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原理，将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习到的潜在标记（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量或显式，通过主任务损失和辅助计划重建损失实现。

Result: 在复杂基准测试中保持或提高了准确性，同时显著减少了推理过程的可见标记占用。

Conclusion: Reasoning Capsule框架在效率、准确性和可解释性之间取得了良好平衡，为复杂推理任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our

TL;DR: GTO通过引入草稿树奖励和基于组的草稿策略训练，解决了推测解码中草稿策略与解码策略不对齐的问题，显著提高了接受长度和推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练目标只优化单一贪婪草稿路径，而解码时采用树策略验证多个分支，这种草稿策略不对齐限制了可实现的加速效果。

Method: GTO包含两个组件：(1)草稿树奖励：采样自由的目标函数，等于草稿树在目标模型下的期望接受长度；(2)基于组的草稿策略训练：通过对比当前和冻结参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏的组标准化优势，并沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格的代理更新。

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务上，GTO将接受长度提高了7.4%，相比之前最先进的EAGLE-3实现了额外的7.7%加速。

Conclusion: GTO通过弥合草稿策略不对齐问题，为高效LLM推理提供了一个实用、通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

Motivation: CoT推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但由于输出冗长导致推理延迟显著增加，需要一种有效的压缩方法

Method: 利用token弹性现象，通过多轮渐进式压缩策略，为每个输入自适应确定最优压缩深度

Result: 相比SOTA基线平均准确率提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟，且性能可预测

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，无需重复微调即可实现高效模型选择和性能预测

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的上下文学习(ICL)在处理大量演示时效率低下，而监督微调(SFT)存在训练开销大且灵活性不足的问题。需要一种能够整合多个信息块的方法来克服这些限制。

Method: 引入CompAs元学习框架，将上下文翻译成具有组合结构的适配器参数。这些适配器可以代数合并，无需重新处理长提示。该方法还包含可逆编码机制，可通过解码器恢复输入上下文。

Result: 在多个选择题和抽取式问答任务上的实验结果表明，CompAs在扩展到更多输入时优于ICL和先前的基于生成器的方法。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了一种实用且高效的替代方案，具有较低的推理成本、对长上下文不稳定的鲁棒性，以及处理超出上下文窗口输入的原则性解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

TL;DR: 通过合成数据蒸馏框架研究推理模型与指令微调模型的性能对比，发现推理模型在数学和通用任务上表现优异，能匹配或超越更大规模的IFT系统，且随着模型规模增大，推理模型在推理密集型任务上的价值更加显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管具备推理能力的大语言模型在多种任务上取得了最优性能，但推理在哪些任务和模型规模下有效，以及其训练和推理成本仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用合成数据蒸馏框架进行大规模监督研究，比较不同规模的指令微调模型和推理模型在数学中心和通用任务上的表现，评估多项选择和开放式两种格式。

Result: 推理持续提升模型性能，经常匹配或超越显著更大的IFT系统。IFT在训练和推理成本上保持帕累托最优，但推理模型随着模型规模增大而价值增加，在推理密集型和开放式任务上克服了IFT的性能限制。

Conclusion: 推理模型在特定任务上具有显著优势，特别是在大规模模型和推理密集型任务中，虽然IFT在成本效率上更优，但推理模型在性能上限方面表现更好。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities have achieved
state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks. Despite its empirical
success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过论证大型语言模型的输出缺乏必要的意图基础，因此其输出本质上是无意义的，但承认这些输出在表面上仍显得有意义且可用于获取知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型输出的语义本质，质疑其是否真正具有意义，挑战当前对AI生成内容的理解。

Method: 基于两个关键前提进行逻辑论证：(a)LLM输出需要特定意图才能具有字面意义；(b)LLM不可能拥有正确的意图类型。

Result: 论证了LLM输出本质上是无意义的，但能够抵御语义外在主义和内在主义的反驳。

Conclusion: 即使LLM输出本质无意义，它们表面上仍显得有意义，并能用于获取真实信念和知识。

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了递归主题划分(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型构建二叉树，通过自然语言问题对文本语料进行语义划分，生成可解释的主题分类法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳的问题，传统模型使用关键词列表需要大量人工解释且缺乏语义连贯性。

Method: RTP框架利用LLMs交互式构建二叉树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，语义上划分数据，形成完全可解释的分类法。

Result: 实验表明RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线的基于关键词的主题更具可解释性，这些聚类在下游分类任务中作为强大特征表现优异。

Conclusion: RTP引入了数据探索的新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，主题路径可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

TL;DR: 现有语义语音分词器对不相关声学扰动很脆弱，导致下游LLM学习负担增加。作者提出StableToken，通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定分词，显著提升噪声条件下的单元编辑距离和SpeechLLM鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义语音分词器在保持语音可懂度的高信噪比下，对不相关声学扰动极其敏感，导致输出标记序列剧烈变化，增加下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 提出StableToken分词器，采用多分支并行处理音频，通过强大的位级投票机制合并表示，形成单一稳定的标记序列。

Result: StableToken在标记稳定性方面达到新SOTA，在多种噪声条件下显著降低单元编辑距离，并直接提升下游SpeechLLM在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过共识驱动机制实现的稳定分词器能够有效解决现有分词器的脆弱性问题，为下游语音语言模型提供更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖单一的推理范式，限制了它们在需要多种认知策略的复杂问题上的表现

Method: 开发复合推理方法，使LLMs能够动态探索和组合演绎、归纳、溯因等多种推理风格

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法超越了CoT和DeepSeek-R1等基线方法，展现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，LLMs获得了更鲁棒、自适应和高效的问题解决能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

*Jaehoon Kim,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出逆向投机解码(RSD)方法解决大模型向小模型知识蒸馏时因分布不对齐导致的性能下降问题，通过让学生模型基于自身概率分布筛选教师模型的推理轨迹，显著提升了小模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大模型向小模型知识蒸馏方法在推理能力迁移中经常失败，性能反而下降，这是因为教师模型的推理轨迹中包含学生模型分布中低概率的token，超出了小模型的内部表示能力。

Method: 提出逆向投机解码(RSD)机制：教师模型生成候选token，但由学生模型基于自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，从而生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: Qwen3-0.6B模型使用传统蒸馏方法在主要推理基准上性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练后性能提升4.9%。分析表明低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈。

Conclusion: RSD方法能有效解决推理能力迁移中的分布不对齐问题，但RSD生成的轨迹具有模型特异性，需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制化分布对齐。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成评估基准与氛围编程范式不匹配，要么需要代码级规范，要么只关注问题解决，忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准，特点包括：纯自然语言提示、严格的多级过滤数据收集流程、包含F2P和P2P测试的全面测试用例、多样化的应用领域。

Result: 评估两个最先进的智能体框架和四个领先LLM，最高成功率仅为29.94%，发现存在"激进实现"倾向，这种策略既导致关键失败又产生优秀软件设计。

Conclusion: 氛围编程范式下的功能实现是一个重大挑战，FeatBench为社区研究提供了基准、自动化收集流程和实验结果。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音到语音LLM是人机自然交互的基础，但目前缺乏有效的基准测试和建模方法，特别是在紧急中断场景下的评估。

Method: 通过六个多样化的人机交互场景系统评估实时对话的延迟、质量和对话效果，并引入模型中断机制。

Result: 发现开源模型与商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 下一令牌对预测为实现真正无缝、类人全双工交互提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法缺乏系统性保护，无法应对现代LLM系统的复杂行为。作者认为应从法律合规角度建立严格的安全标准。

Method: 1) 基于法律条款生成真实LLM安全场景，建立安全合规基准；2) 使用Group Policy Optimization方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，在欧盟AI法案和GDPR上的平均改进分别为+10.45%和+11.85%。

Conclusion: 从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题是有效的，Compliance Reasoner能够显著提升LLM对法律标准的遵循程度，降低安全风险。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一种创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到LLMs的推理过程中，通过KGR、KGE和KGA模块解决LLMs处理知识图谱时的结构信息利用不足和嵌入空间不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs处理幻觉问题的主要方法是将知识图谱作为纯文本处理，仅提取语义信息而忽略了知识图谱的关键结构方面，同时知识图谱编码器和LLMs文本嵌入之间的嵌入空间差距也阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: 提出SSKG-LLM架构，包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块和知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义同时利用结构，然后通过知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLMs能够理解知识图谱嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合知识图谱结构信息如何增强LLMs的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息，显著提升LLMs的事实推理能力，解决了当前方法在处理知识图谱时的局限性。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型常从训练数据中复制或放大社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP中可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中，对编码器和仅解码器模型进行了系统研究，考察了三个关键维度：(1)识别偏见预测，(2)选择公平模型，(3)在模型训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为减少训练中偏见的有用监督，但在候选模型中选择公平模型时不可靠。

Conclusion: 可解释性工具在识别和缓解偏见方面有价值，但在模型选择方面需要谨慎使用，建议开发更可靠的公平性评估方法。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率，优于GPT-4o和DeepSeek-R1-0528模型；谓词可用性提升性能15-20%；T5模型超越更大的仅解码器LLMs；模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译被证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Motivation: 研究transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系推理的能力，以及规模扩展如何影响这种能力，这在因果推理等场景中至关重要。

Method: 生成有向图训练不同规模的transformer模型，评估它们在各种图大小下推断传递关系的能力，重点关注网格图的维度特征。

Result: transformer能学习低维网格图的连通性，图维度是预测学习能力的重要指标，模型规模增加能提升泛化能力，但在多组件非网格图上表现不佳。

Conclusion: transformer学习传递关系推理的能力受图结构特征影响显著，在低维网格图上表现良好，但在复杂图结构上仍有局限。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as
verbal syllogistic reasoning. This paper explores in which way a similar
Bayesian approach might be applied to relevance-theoretic pragmatics (Sperber &
Wilson, 1995) by study a paradigmatic pragmatic phenomenon: the communication
of implicit meaning by ways of (conversational) implicatures.

TL;DR: CHRONOBERG是一个时间结构化的英文书籍语料库，跨越250年，用于研究语言的时间变化和训练具有时间感知能力的语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLM理解语言语义和规范演变的能力。需要支持历时语言变化分析和训练的资源。

Method: 从Project Gutenberg精选英文书籍文本，构建时间结构化语料库，添加时间注释，进行时间敏感的VAD情感分析，构建历史校准的情感词典。

Result: 展示了现代LLM工具在检测歧视性语言和情感分析时需要更好地考虑时间背景。语言模型在CHRONOBERG上顺序训练时难以编码历时意义变化。

Conclusion: 需要时间感知的训练和评估流程，CHRONOBERG可作为研究语言变化和时间泛化的可扩展资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个使用大型语言模型(LLMs)对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析的框架，超越了传统文本分类，实现了故障模式识别、因果链推理等复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中包含大量非结构化文本信息，传统定量可靠性分析难以利用这些数据。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在分类层面，无法进行复杂推理。

Method: 引入探索性框架，使用LLMs进行深度语义分析，执行四种分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推理、比较站点分析和数据质量审计。

Result: LLMs可以作为强大的"可靠性副驾驶"，超越标签分类，综合文本信息并生成可操作的专家级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作贡献了一种新颖且可复现的方法论，将LLMs用作推理工具，为风能行业提供增强运营智能的新途径。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析OLMO2开源模型训练数据中的政治偏见，发现左倾文档在数据集中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的偏见密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型已知会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见来源尚不清楚。需要分析训练数据中的政治内容来理解偏见形成机制。

Method: 从OLMO2的预训练和后训练语料库中抽取大样本，自动标注文档的政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，并评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源来构建相似主题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见强相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据整理流程中整合政治内容分析，并详细记录过滤策略以提高透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Chimera测试套件来评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现现有模型主要依赖捷径行为而非真正理解


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图谱相关基准测试中表现良好，但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径，而非真正理解和推理图表

Method: 构建包含7,500个高质量维基百科图表的Chimera测试套件，每个图表用语义三元组标注，并设计多层次问题评估四个基本理解方面

Result: 评估15个开源VLM发现其表面强大性能主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在关键局限性，需要更稳健的评估协议来基准化对复杂视觉输入的真实理解而非问答捷径

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

*Maor Juliet Lavi,Tova Milo,Mor Geva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答性的方法，在抽取式问答任务中有效识别无答案问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常在缺乏足够信息时仍自信回答问题，导致产生幻觉答案，需要检测不可回答性问题

Method: 通过激活加法识别模型激活空间中捕获不可回答性的方向，将该方向投影用于分类

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试中，该方法能有效检测不可回答问题，且比现有方法具有更好的跨数据集泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能处理抽取式QA的不可回答性，还能扩展到其他因素（如缺乏科学共识和主观性）导致的不可回答情况，因果干预验证了方向的有效性

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLMs构成显著挑战，准确率常低于50%，且存在提示敏感性和对抗性脆弱性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在LLMs主导的时代，了解其在法律等高风险领域的能力和局限性至关重要，特别是在多语言、跨司法管辖区和对抗性环境下的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，在多语言法律和非法律基准上测试LLaMA和Gemini，并通过字符和词级扰动评估其对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 法律推理任务准确率常低于50%，而通用任务如XNLI可达70%以上；Gemini平均比LLaMA高约24个百分点；英语结果更稳定但不总是更准确；语言性能与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLMs有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

TL;DR: NeLLCom-Lex是一个神经代理框架，通过将代理锚定在真实词汇系统（如英语）中并系统操纵其交际需求来模拟语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的观察方法（语料库分析、分布语义建模）无法揭示因果机制，而人类实验范式难以应用于语义变化这种历时过程。

Method: 使用颜色命名任务，通过不同的监督学习和强化学习流程训练神经代理，研究哪些因素导致代理发展出类人命名行为和词汇系统。

Result: 实验表明，经过训练以'说'现有语言的神经代理能够显著程度地重现人类颜色命名模式。

Conclusion: 支持进一步使用NeLLCom-Lex来阐明语义变化的机制。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Method: 提出解决方案分歧作为新指标，在三个代表性问题领域测试该指标对监督微调和强化学习策略的支持效果。

Result: 实验表明，使用解决方案分歧能持续提高成功率，解决方案分歧与问题解决能力呈正相关关系。

Conclusion: 解决方案分歧是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进大语言模型的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可扩展且可解释的LLM表示方式，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库，在模型选择任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Motivation: 传统单目标对齐方法会导致灾难性遗忘，而朴素多分支设计会造成推理碎片化，需要统一的框架来同时优化多个对齐目标。

Method: 采用两阶段1对N框架：第一阶段计算共享表示，第二阶段克隆为并行分支并通过策略参考机制进行目标特定控制。

Result: 在多个7B LLM上，AMBS将平均对齐分数提升32.4%，不安全输出减少11.0%，优于朴素1对N基线。

Conclusion: AMBS能够有效统一高效地实现多目标对齐，在保持跨目标一致性的同时提升对齐性能。

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型训练的巨大计算成本是创新的主要障碍，FP8训练虽有理论效率优势，但缺乏开源训练方案阻碍了其广泛应用。

Method: 采用端到端FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合粒度量化策略来平衡数值精度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方法稳定且几乎无损，性能与BF16基线相当，同时训练时间减少22%，峰值内存使用降低14%，吞吐量提升19%。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以促进大规模模型训练的民主化。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

Motivation: 传统LLMs的逻辑推理范式不适合处理社交情境，因为社交情境需要解释模糊线索而非得出确定答案。

Method: 提出CogFlow框架：1)通过树状规划模拟人类思维创建认知流程数据集；2)监督微调培养基本认知推理能力；3)强化学习优化认知流程和响应质量。

Result: 实验表明CogFlow有效提升了LLMs的社会认知能力，甚至改善了人类的社交决策效果。

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥补了LLMs在社交推理方面的不足，为AI处理复杂社交情境提供了新途径。

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

Conclusion: RAEC管道可作为患者消息的AI护栏，通过参考历史消息对显著提高了LLM生成回复的评估质量。

Abstract: Asynchronous patient-clinician messaging via EHR portals is a growing source
of clinician workload, prompting interest in large language models (LLMs) to
assist with draft responses. However, LLM outputs may contain clinical
inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

*Yehonatan Pesiakhovsky,Zorik Gekhman,Yosi Mass,Liat Ein-Dor,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用LLMs定位上下文幻觉（模型输出中无法从源文本验证的信息）的可行性，构建了专门的基准测试，并提出基于自由文本描述的新表示方法。研究发现LLMs在该任务上表现有限，最佳模型F1分数仅为0.67，主要挑战包括错误标记缺失细节和难以处理与模型参数知识一致但源文本未包含的信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs定位上下文幻觉的适用性，作为现有复杂评估流程的更实用替代方案。由于缺乏幻觉定位元评估的基准，需要构建专门针对LLMs的基准。

Method: 构建包含1000多个示例的人类标注基准，提出基于自由文本描述的新幻觉表示方法，评估四个大规模LLMs，分析最佳提示策略和任务挑战因素。

Result: 基准测试具有挑战性，最佳模型F1分数仅为0.67。LLMs主要存在两个问题：倾向于错误标记缺失细节为不一致，以及难以处理源文本未包含但与模型参数知识一致的事实正确信息。

Conclusion: LLMs在定位上下文幻觉方面能力有限，需要改进提示策略和处理与参数知识冲突的情况。提出的新表示方法能更好地捕捉各种可能的错误类型。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为自然语言结构建模提供一个严格且可解释的基础，验证子正则层次结构在语言学习中的适用性。

Method: 使用判定谓词表示子正则语言类，通过线性模型进行学习，并在合成数据和英语形态学真实数据上进行实验验证。

Result: 在无噪声条件下实现了完美可分性，英语形态学实验中学习到的特征与已知语言约束一致。

Conclusion: 子正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严格且可解释的基础，证明了其在线性可分性和可学习性方面的有效性。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Conclusion: 研究结果在公共政策制定、辩论评估、决策支持框架和大规模社交媒体意见挖掘方面具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验性能分数的变化既来自模型相关因素也来自数据相关因素，需要同时考虑两者以避免低估整体变异性。

Method: 使用重采样方法，在多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等任务中应用。

Result: 重采样方法可用于计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布，如平均值/中位数、模型间成对差异和排名。

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试不确定性的有效工具，能更准确地反映性能指标的统计变异性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种通过后训练高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的训练流程，能够提升循环神经网络的长上下文召回能力和上下文学习能力，而不会显著增加参数或训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型处理长上下文成本高昂，而RNN虽然复杂度恒定但召回能力有限，因为所有上下文信息都被压缩到固定大小的循环状态中。直接训练更大状态的RNN会导致高训练成本。

Method: 为线性注意力和状态空间模型这两类流行RNN设计了后训练架构修改，通过StateX训练流程扩展状态大小，几乎不增加模型参数。

Result: 在1.3B参数规模的模型上实验表明，StateX能有效提升RNN的召回和上下文学习能力，且后训练成本低，不损害其他能力。

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展预训练RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文召回方面的局限性，同时避免了高训练成本。

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一个变分推理框架，将语言模型的思维轨迹视为潜变量并通过变分推理进行优化，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型的推理能力提供原则性的概率视角，通过变分推理框架稳定训练目标并改进推理能力。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式稳定变分后验训练，将拒绝采样微调和二元奖励RL解释为局部前向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上验证了方法的有效性，在广泛的推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了统一变分推理与RL风格方法的概率视角，产生了稳定的目标来提升语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略(FCP)，将语言反馈作为条件信号直接学习，而不是压缩为标量奖励，通过离线最大似然训练和在线自举阶段来优化LLM从语言反馈中的学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息丢失和尺度不平衡问题，需要更直接利用语言反馈的方法。

Method: 反馈条件策略(FCP)：1) 离线阶段通过最大似然训练学习响应-反馈对；2) 在线自举阶段在正面条件下生成响应并接收新反馈进行自我精炼。

Result: 该方法将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLM直接从语言反馈中学习提供了更具表达力的方式。

Conclusion: FCP框架通过将语言反馈作为条件信号，提供了一种更丰富、更直接的方式来训练LLM，避免了标量奖励的信息压缩问题。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了n-gram新颖性作为创造力衡量指标的局限性，发现虽然n-gram新颖性与专家评定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达并未被判定为有创造力。研究还发现开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性会降低实用性，前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究广泛使用n-gram新颖性来评估语言模型的创造力和生成能力，但创造力理论表明这种方法可能不足，因为它没有考虑创造力的双重性：新颖性和适当性（合理性和实用性）。

Method: 通过7542个专家作家注释（n=26）对人工和AI生成文本的新颖性、实用性和合理性进行细读评估，研究n-gram新颖性与创造力的关系，并测试零样本、少样本和微调模型识别创造性表达和非实用表达的能力。

Result: n-gram新颖性与专家评定的创造力正相关，但91%的高n-gram新颖性表达未被判定为有创造力；开源LLM的高n-gram新颖性会降低实用性；前沿闭源模型产生创造性表达的可能性低于人类；前沿LLM在识别创造性表达方面表现优于随机但仍有改进空间，特别是在识别非实用表达方面。

Conclusion: 不应仅依赖n-gram新颖性来评估创造力，因为它无法充分捕捉创造力的双重性。LLM在识别创造性表达方面有潜力但需改进，特别是对非实用表达的识别。LLM-as-a-Judge的新颖性评分能预测专家偏好。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的代码代理在网站代码生成任务中仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是视觉效果和用户交互方面。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，利用视觉语言模型分析网站截图和GUI代理测试结果，生成详细的文本描述、建议和质量评分，结合回溯和最优选择机制，并引入Step-GRPO训练方法使用视觉评分作为奖励信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升到51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升到3.9；Step-GRPO训练使Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升到45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升到3.7。

Conclusion: 多级视觉反馈和GUI代理测试能有效提升网站代码生成质量，Step-GRPO训练方法通过密集可靠的过程监督信号显著改善大语言模型的网站生成能力。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估语音AI助手的全面能力，需要更全面的评估框架来指导下一代AI助手的发展。

Method: 构建包含10,497个示例的基准，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及异质图像观看任务。评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：专有模型并非普遍优于开源模型；大多数模型擅长说话任务但在音频理解方面落后；设计良好的小模型可以与更大模型竞争。Step-Audio-2-mini(7B)的听力准确率是LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual的两倍多。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态输入和角色扮演声音模仿任务上仍有困难，在鲁棒性和安全对齐方面存在显著差距。VoiceAssistant-Eval为评估和指导下一代AI助手发展提供了严格框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

### [269] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器的真实性能，避免因行为诱发信息泄露而高估其效果。通过内容过滤、分数过滤和微调模型生物三种策略，在欺骗检测案例中识别并缓解了两种信息泄露问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和评估白盒监控器需要展示目标行为的响应样本，但这些样本通常通过提示或微调获得，导致诱发信息不可避免地泄露到监控器输入数据中，从而夸大其有效性。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（从输入中移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关标记的分数）、提示蒸馏微调模型生物（训练模型在不明确提示下展示欺骗行为）。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤能平滑移除诱发信号，使探针AUROC降低30%；分数过滤使AUROC降低15%；微调模型生物改进了监控器评估，但即使重新训练，性能也会降低高达40%。

Conclusion: 白盒监控器的性能评估容易受到信息泄露的影响，需要采用适当的缓解策略来确保评估结果的真实性。内容过滤和微调模型生物是有效的评估改进方法。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以大规模验证链式思维推理过程，需要一种能够验证推理路径正确性的方法。

Method: 引入决策支点作为可验证检查点，通过采样推理路径挖掘共享支点，压缩为支点聚焦的短路径推理，并进行自我训练。

Result: 在LogiQA、MedQA和MATH500等标准基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning exposes the intermediate thinking process of
large language models (LLMs), yet verifying those traces at scale remains
unsolved. In response, we introduce the idea of decision pivots-minimal,
verifiable checkpoints that any correct reasoning path must visit. We
hypothesize that correct reasoning, though stylistically diverse, converge on
the same pivot set, while incorrect ones violate at least one pivot. Leveraging
this property, we propose a self-training pipeline that (i) samples diverse
reasoning paths and mines shared decision pivots, (ii) compresses each trace
into pivot-focused short-path reasoning using an auxiliary verifier, and (iii)
post-trains the model using its self-generated outputs. The proposed method
aligns reasoning without ground truth reasoning data or external metrics.
Experiments on standard benchmarks such as LogiQA, MedQA, and MATH500 show the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 为民主化气候数据访问和建立可重复、可扩展的人类-AI协作科学研究框架开辟了道路。

Abstract: Climate data science faces persistent barriers stemming from the fragmented
nature of data sources, heterogeneous formats, and the steep technical
expertise required to identify, acquire, and process datasets. These challenges
limit participation, slow discovery, and reduce the reproducibility of
scientific workflows. In this paper, we present a proof of concept for
addressing these barriers through the integration of a curated knowledge graph
(KG) with AI agents designed for cloud-native scientific workflows. The KG
provides a unifying layer that organizes datasets, tools, and workflows, while
AI agents -- powered by generative AI services -- enable natural language
interaction, automated data access, and streamlined analysis. Together, these
components drastically lower the technical threshold for engaging in climate
data science, enabling non-specialist users to identify and analyze relevant
datasets. By leveraging existing cloud-ready API data portals, we demonstrate
that "a knowledge graph is all you need" to unlock scalable and agentic
workflows for scientific inquiry. The open-source design of our system further
supports community contributions, ensuring that the KG and associated tools can
evolve as a shared commons. Our results illustrate a pathway toward
democratizing access to climate data and establishing a reproducible,
extensible framework for human--AI collaboration in scientific research.

*Mohammad Parsa Afshar,Aryan Azimi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究使用脑电图数据和机器学习模型预测消费者行为，比较了传统机器学习模型和图神经网络模型在NeuMa数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测消费者行为在营销、认知神经科学和人机交互中很重要。脑电图数据可以提供大脑神经活动的详细信息，帮助分析决策过程。

Method: 从NeuMa数据集中提取和清理EEG特征，为GNN模型创建大脑连接特征。使用传统机器学习模型（如集成模型）和不同架构的GNN模型进行比较。

Result: 虽然整体结果没有显示显著差异，但GNN模型在某些传统模型表现不佳的基本标准上表现更好。

Conclusion: EEG信号分析与机器学习模型结合可以更深入理解消费者行为，研究提供了传统模型（如SVM）与新兴模型（如GNN）在基于EEG的神经营销中的全面比较。

Abstract: Prediction of consumer behavior is one of the important purposes in
marketing, cognitive neuroscience, and human-computer interaction. The
electroencephalography (EEG) data can help analyze the decision process by
providing detailed information about the brain's neural activity. In this
research, a comparative approach is utilized for predicting consumer behavior
by EEG data. In the first step, the features of the EEG data from the NeuMa
dataset were extracted and cleaned. For the Graph Neural Network (GNN) models,
the brain connectivity features were created. Different machine learning
models, such as classical models and Graph Neural Networks, are used and
compared. The GNN models with different architectures are implemented to have a
comprehensive comparison; furthermore, a wide range of classical models, such
as ensemble models, are applied, which can be very helpful to show the
difference and performance of each model on the dataset. Although the results
did not show a significant difference overall, the GNN models generally
performed better in some basic criteria where classical models were not
satisfactory. This study not only shows that combining EEG signal analysis and
machine learning models can provide an approach to deeper understanding of
consumer behavior, but also provides a comprehensive comparison between the
machine learning models that have been widely used in previous studies in the
EEG-based neuromarketing such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), and the models
which are not used or rarely used in the field, like Graph Neural Networks.

TL;DR: GeoEvolve是一个多智能体LLM框架，结合进化搜索和地理空间领域知识，自动设计和优化地理空间算法，在空间插值和不确定性量化任务上显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的算法发现框架（如AlphaEvolve）擅长演化通用代码，但缺乏解决复杂地理空间问题所需的领域知识和多步推理能力。

Method: 采用两层嵌套循环：内循环使用代码演化器生成和变异候选解，外循环通过智能控制器评估全局精英，并查询GeoKnowRAG模块（结构化地理空间知识库）注入地理学理论先验。

Result: 在空间插值任务上减少RMSE误差13-21%，在不确定性估计任务上提升性能17%。消融研究证实领域引导检索对稳定高质量演化至关重要。

Conclusion: GeoEvolve为自动化、知识驱动的地理空间建模提供了可扩展路径，为可信赖和高效的AI-for-Science发现开辟了新机遇。

Abstract: Geospatial modeling provides critical solutions for pressing global
challenges such as sustainability and climate change. Existing large language
model (LLM)-based algorithm discovery frameworks, such as AlphaEvolve, excel at
evolving generic code but lack the domain knowledge and multi-step reasoning
required for complex geospatial problems. We introduce GeoEvolve, a multi-agent
LLM framework that couples evolutionary search with geospatial domain knowledge
to automatically design and refine geospatial algorithms. GeoEvolve operates in
two nested loops: an inner loop leverages a code evolver to generate and mutate
candidate solutions, while an outer agentic controller evaluates global elites
and queries a GeoKnowRAG module -- a structured geospatial knowledge base that
injects theoretical priors from geography. This knowledge-guided evolution
steers the search toward theoretically meaningful and computationally efficient
algorithms. We evaluate GeoEvolve on two fundamental and classical tasks:
spatial interpolation (kriging) and spatial uncertainty quantification
(geospatial conformal prediction). Across these benchmarks, GeoEvolve
automatically improves and discovers new algorithms, incorporating geospatial
theory on top of classical models. It reduces spatial interpolation error
(RMSE) by 13-21% and enhances uncertainty estimation performance by 17\%.
Ablation studies confirm that domain-guided retrieval is essential for stable,
high-quality evolution. These results demonstrate that GeoEvolve provides a
scalable path toward automated, knowledge-driven geospatial modeling, opening
new opportunities for trustworthy and efficient AI-for-Science discovery.

TL;DR: 提出可解释的多模态AI框架MultiFIX，整合临床变量和CT影像进行生存分析，在头颈癌数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肿瘤学中需要准确且可解释的生存分析方法，随着多模态数据的增长和临床对透明模型的需求，这一挑战变得更加复杂。

Method: 使用深度学习推断生存相关特征：影像特征通过Grad-CAM解释，临床变量通过遗传编程建模为符号表达式，风险估计采用透明Cox回归进行分层。

Result: 在头颈癌RADCURE数据集上，MultiFIX的C-index达到0.838（预测）和0.826（分层），优于临床和学术基线方法，并与已知预后标志物一致。

Conclusion: MultiFIX展示了可解释多模态AI在精准肿瘤学中的潜力，能够提供透明且准确的生存分析。

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable survival analysis remains a core challenge in
oncology. With growing multimodal data and the clinical need for transparent
models to support validation and trust, this challenge increases in complexity.
We propose an interpretable multimodal AI framework to automate survival
analysis by integrating clinical variables and computed tomography imaging. Our
MultiFIX-based framework uses deep learning to infer survival-relevant features
that are further explained: imaging features are interpreted via Grad-CAM,
while clinical variables are modeled as symbolic expressions through genetic
programming. Risk estimation employs a transparent Cox regression, enabling
stratification into groups with distinct survival outcomes. Using the
open-source RADCURE dataset for head and neck cancer, MultiFIX achieves a
C-index of 0.838 (prediction) and 0.826 (stratification), outperforming the
clinical and academic baseline approaches and aligning with known prognostic
markers. These results highlight the promise of interpretable multimodal AI for
precision oncology with MultiFIX.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了语义F1分数，这是一种用于主观或多标签分类的新评估指标，通过量化预测标签与真实标签之间的语义相关性来改进传统F1指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统F1指标将语义相关的预测视为完全失败，无法反映人类标注者分歧或模糊类别边界的现实情况。需要一种能够给予语义相关标签部分信用的评估方法。

Method: 使用标签相似度矩阵计算软精度和软召回分数，通过新颖的两步精度-召回公式，无需丢弃标签或强制匹配不相似标签即可比较任意大小的标签集。

Result: 语义F1分数在理论和实证验证中显示出更好的可解释性和生态效度，能够公平评估类别重叠和标注者分歧的情况。

Conclusion: 语义F1分数提供更公平的评估，仅需领域适当的相似度矩阵而非严格本体论，适用于各种任务和模态。

Abstract: We propose Semantic F1 Scores, novel evaluation metrics for subjective or
fuzzy multi-label classification that quantify semantic relatedness between
predicted and gold labels. Unlike the conventional F1 metrics that treat
semantically related predictions as complete failures, Semantic F1 incorporates
a label similarity matrix to compute soft precision-like and recall-like
scores, from which the Semantic F1 scores are derived. Unlike existing
similarity-based metrics, our novel two-step precision-recall formulation
enables the comparison of label sets of arbitrary sizes without discarding
labels or forcing matches between dissimilar labels. By granting partial credit
for semantically related but nonidentical labels, Semantic F1 better reflects
the realities of domains marked by human disagreement or fuzzy category
boundaries. In this way, it provides fairer evaluations: it recognizes that
categories overlap, that annotators disagree, and that downstream decisions
based on similar predictions lead to similar outcomes. Through theoretical
justification and extensive empirical validation on synthetic and real data, we
show that Semantic F1 demonstrates greater interpretability and ecological
validity. Because it requires only a domain-appropriate similarity matrix,
which is robust to misspecification, and not a rigid ontology, it is applicable
across tasks and modalities.

Abstract: When AI interacts with the physical world -- as a robot or an assistive agent
-- new safety challenges emerge beyond those of purely ``digital AI". In such
interactions, the potential for physical harm is direct and immediate. How well
do state-of-the-art foundation models understand common-sense facts about
physical safety, e.g. that a box may be too heavy to lift, or that a hot cup of
coffee should not be handed to a child? In this paper, our contributions are
three-fold: first, we develop a highly scalable approach to continuous physical
safety benchmarking of Embodied AI systems, grounded in real-world injury
narratives and operational safety constraints. To probe multi-modal safety
understanding, we turn these narratives and constraints into photorealistic
images and videos capturing transitions from safe to unsafe states, using
advanced generative models. Secondly, we comprehensively analyze the ability of
major foundation models to perceive risks, reason about safety, and trigger
interventions; this yields multi-faceted insights into their deployment
readiness for safety-critical agentic applications. Finally, we develop a
post-training paradigm to teach models to explicitly reason about
embodiment-specific safety constraints provided through system instructions.
The resulting models generate thinking traces that make safety reasoning
interpretable and transparent, achieving state of the art performance in
constraint satisfaction evaluations. The benchmark will be released at

TL;DR: 提出基于GRPO的框架，通过多语言预训练和有限配对数据微调，结合ASR、说话人验证和音频质量评估的多目标奖励，实现低资源语言的文本到语音合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言缺乏配对的文本-语音数据，而ASR模型相对容易获得，因此需要利用ASR等资源来提升TTS性能。

Method: 1. 使用IPA音标训练多语言TTS基线模型；2. 用有限配对数据微调以学习目标语言韵律特征；3. 应用GRPO优化，仅使用未配对文本和说话人提示，通过预训练ASR、说话人验证和音频质量模型的多目标奖励进行指导。

Result: 在低资源语言上生成可理解且说话人一致的语音，显著优于仅微调方法；在高资源语言上也超越DPO等离线对齐方法，在可懂度、说话人相似性和音频质量方面表现更优。

Conclusion: GRPO框架能有效提升低资源和高资源语言的TTS性能，利用ASR等现有资源解决数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Developing high-quality text-to-speech (TTS) systems for low-resource
languages is challenging due to the scarcity of paired text and speech data. In
contrast, automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for such languages are
often more accessible, owing to large-scale multilingual pre-training efforts.
We propose a framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
adapt an autoregressive, multilingual TTS model to new languages. Our method
first establishes a language-agnostic foundation for TTS synthesis by training
a multilingual baseline with International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) tokens.
Next, we fine-tune this model on limited paired data of the new languages to
capture the target language's prosodic features. Finally, we apply GRPO to
optimize the model using only unpaired text and speaker prompts, guided by a
multi-objective reward from pretrained ASR, speaker verification, and audio
quality estimation models. Experiments demonstrate that this pipeline produces
intelligible and speaker-consistent speech in low-resource languages,
substantially outperforming fine-tuning alone. Furthermore, our GRPO-based
framework also improves TTS performance in high-resource languages, surpassing
offline alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) yielding
superior intelligibility, speaker similarity, and audio quality.

TL;DR: RoT通过检索和重用先前的推理步骤来构建动态模板，减少推理时的冗余探索，从而显著降低输出token数量、推理延迟和成本，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型通过生成长推理轨迹来提高准确性，但这会增加延迟和成本，因此需要在推理时提高效率。

Method: 提出Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT)方法，将先前的推理步骤组织成带有顺序和语义边的思想图，通过检索相关节点和奖励引导的遍历来组装问题特定的生成模板。

Result: RoT在多个模型和推理基准测试中，输出token减少高达40%，推理延迟降低82%，成本降低59%，同时保持准确性，仅带来较小的提示增长。

Conclusion: RoT通过检索构建动态模板，为高效的大型推理模型推理建立了可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Large reasoning models improve accuracy by producing long reasoning traces,
but this inflates latency and cost, motivating inference-time efficiency. We
propose Retrieval-of-Thought (RoT), which reuses prior reasoning as composable
``thought" steps to guide new problems. RoT organizes steps into a thought
graph with sequential and semantic edges to enable fast retrieval and flexible
recombination. At inference, RoT retrieves query-relevant nodes and applies
reward-guided traversal to assemble a problem-specific template that guides
generation. This dynamic template reuse reduces redundant exploration and,
therefore, reduces output tokens while preserving accuracy. We evaluate RoT on
reasoning benchmarks with multiple models, measuring accuracy, token usage,
latency, and memory overhead. Findings show small prompt growth but substantial
efficiency gains, with RoT reducing output tokens by up to 40%, inference
latency by 82%, and cost by 59% while maintaining accuracy. RoT establishes a
scalable paradigm for efficient LRM reasoning via dynamic template construction
through retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在遇到新任务时，要么依赖零样本泛化（效果差），要么微调（导致灾难性遗忘），需要一种终身学习方法来持续学习多个任务。

Method: 提出LLR-BC框架，通过决策寻求方式将新任务训练的解算器行为与缓冲区中的行为对齐，并为低置信度决策分配更大的巩固权重。

Result: 在容量约束车辆路径问题和旅行商问题上的实验表明，LLR-BC能有效训练高性能神经求解器，解决灾难性遗忘，保持可塑性并提升零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: LLR-BC为神经VRP求解器提供了一种有效的终身学习解决方案，能够在持续学习过程中保持性能并提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent neural solvers have demonstrated promising performance in learning to
solve routing problems. However, existing studies are primarily based on
one-off training on one or a set of predefined problem distributions and
scales, i.e., tasks. When a new task arises, they typically rely on either
zero-shot generalization, which may be poor due to the discrepancies between
the new task and the training task(s), or fine-tuning the pretrained solver on
the new task, which possibly leads to catastrophic forgetting of knowledge
acquired from previous tasks. This paper explores a novel lifelong learning
paradigm for neural VRP solvers, where multiple tasks with diverse
distributions and scales arise sequentially over time. Solvers are required to
effectively and efficiently learn to solve new tasks while maintaining their
performance on previously learned tasks. Consequently, a novel framework called
Lifelong Learning Router with Behavior Consolidation (LLR-BC) is proposed.
LLR-BC consolidates prior knowledge effectively by aligning behaviors of the
solver trained on a new task with the buffered ones in a decision-seeking way.
To encourage more focus on crucial experiences, LLR-BC assigns greater
consolidated weights to decisions with lower confidence. Extensive experiments
on capacitated vehicle routing problems and traveling salesman problems
demonstrate LLR-BC's effectiveness in training high-performance neural solvers
in a lifelong learning setting, addressing the catastrophic forgetting issue,
maintaining their plasticity, and improving zero-shot generalization ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注短期、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）往往需要长视野和部分可观测环境下的持续能力，缺乏系统性评估基准。

Method: 引入UltraHorizon基准，通过探索任务在三个不同环境中验证核心能力，智能体需要在长视野发现任务中通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 实验显示LLM智能体在这些设置中持续表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高；简单扩展方法在任务中失败；识别出8种错误类型，归因于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距。

Conclusion: 现有智能体在长视野任务中存在显著能力差距，需要开发更先进的持续推理和规划方法来解决上下文锁定和基础能力不足的问题。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注视觉感知或UI代码生成，缺乏对端到端网页应用所需的推理、鲁棒性和安全性能力的充分评估。

Method: 从729个网站构建包含3799个问答对的基准，采用标准化提示、确定性评估脚本和结合自动检查与人工验证的多阶段质量控制。

Result: 评估12个MLLM发现，模型在真实布局的组合推理、面对UI扰动时的鲁棒性以及识别安全关键操作方面存在显著差距。

Conclusion: WebRSSBench揭示了MLLM在网页理解能力上的重要不足，为未来模型开发提供了有价值的评估基准。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly positioned as AI
collaborators for building complex web-related applications like GUI agents and
front-end code generation. However, existing benchmarks largely emphasize
visual perception or UI code generation, showing insufficient evaluation on the
reasoning, robustness and safety capability required for end-to-end web
applications. To bridge the gap, we introduce a comprehensive web understanding
benchmark, named WebRSSBench, that jointly evaluates Reasoning, Robustness, and
Safety across eight tasks, such as position relationship reasoning, color
robustness, and safety critical detection, etc. The benchmark is constructed
from 729 websites and contains 3799 question answer pairs that probe multi-step
inference over page structure, text, widgets, and safety-critical interactions.
To ensure reliable measurement, we adopt standardized prompts, deterministic
evaluation scripts, and multi-stage quality control combining automatic checks
with targeted human verification. We evaluate 12 MLLMs on WebRSSBench. The
results reveal significant gaps, models still struggle with compositional and
cross-element reasoning over realistic layouts, show limited robustness when
facing perturbations in user interfaces and content such as layout
rearrangements or visual style shifts, and are rather conservative in
recognizing and avoiding safety critical or irreversible actions. Our code is

TL;DR: D-Artemis是一个基于人类认知循环（思考、对齐、反思）的新型GUI代理框架，通过细粒度应用提示检索、预执行对齐和状态反思机制，在无需复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下显著提升多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GUI代理方法面临数据瓶颈、延迟错误检测成本高和矛盾指导风险等关键挑战，需要更有效的认知机制来提升自动化任务的可靠性和效率。

Method: 采用思考-对齐-反思的认知循环框架，包含应用特定提示检索、预执行对齐（思想-行动一致性检查和行动校正代理）、以及后执行状态反思代理。

Result: 在两个主要基准测试中达到新的SOTA结果：AndroidWorld上75.8%的成功率，ScreenSpot-V2上96.8%的成功率。消融研究证实了各组件的重要贡献。

Conclusion: D-Artemis框架通过模拟人类认知过程，在不依赖复杂轨迹数据集训练的情况下，显著增强了通用多模态大语言模型在GUI任务中的能力，展现了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents aim to automate a wide spectrum of
human tasks by emulating user interaction. Despite rapid advancements, current
approaches are hindered by several critical challenges: data bottleneck in
end-to-end training, high cost of delayed error detection, and risk of
contradictory guidance. Inspired by the human cognitive loop of Thinking,
Alignment, and Reflection, we present D-Artemis -- a novel deliberative
framework in this paper. D-Artemis leverages a fine-grained, app-specific tip
retrieval mechanism to inform its decision-making process. It also employs a
proactive Pre-execution Alignment stage, where Thought-Action Consistency (TAC)
Check module and Action Correction Agent (ACA) work in concert to mitigate the
risk of execution failures. A post-execution Status Reflection Agent (SRA)
completes the cognitive loop, enabling strategic learning from experience.
Crucially, D-Artemis enhances the capabilities of general-purpose Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) for GUI tasks without the need for training on
complex trajectory datasets, demonstrating strong generalization. D-Artemis
establishes new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results across both major benchmarks,
achieving a 75.8% success rate on AndroidWorld and 96.8% on ScreenSpot-V2.
Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the significant contribution of
each component to the framework.

Motivation: 现有基于规则或模型的奖励方法难以泛化到GUI智能体，因为缺乏真实轨迹或应用数据库，而静态轨迹评估方法准确性有限。

Method: 使用通用推理器调度针对性状态探测任务，领域特定评估器主动与环境交互收集额外观察，从而为GUI智能体分配更准确可验证的奖励。

Conclusion: ProRe通过主动环境交互和协作推理，有效解决了GUI智能体奖励评估的挑战，显著提升了评估准确性和智能体性能。

Abstract: Reward is critical to the evaluation and training of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing rule-based or model-based reward methods struggle to
generalize to GUI agents, where access to ground-truth trajectories or
application databases is often unavailable, and static trajectory-based
LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from limited accuracy. To address these
challenges, we propose ProRe, a proactive reward system that leverages a
general-purpose reasoner and domain-specific evaluator agents (actors). The
reasoner schedules targeted state probing tasks, which the evaluator agents
then execute by actively interacting with the environment to collect additional
observations. This enables the reasoner to assign more accurate and verifiable
rewards to GUI agents. Empirical results on over 3K trajectories demonstrate
that ProRe improves reward accuracy and F1 score by up to 5.3% and 19.4%,
respectively. Furthermore, integrating ProRe with state-of-the-art policy
agents yields a success rate improvement of up to 22.4%.

*Jaehyun Nam,Jinsung Yoon,Jiefeng Chen,Jinwoo Shin,Tomas Pfister*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DS-STAR是一个新型数据科学智能体，通过自动数据文件分析、LLM验证步骤和顺序规划机制，解决了LLM在处理异构数据格式和生成分析计划方面的局限性，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据科学任务通常涉及探索多个数据源并综合发现，但大型语言模型在处理异构数据格式和生成最优分析计划方面存在困难，因为验证计划充分性在没有真实标签的开放任务中具有挑战性。

Method: DS-STAR包含三个关键组件：(1)数据文件分析模块，自动探索和提取各种数据格式的上下文；(2)验证步骤，LLM评估每个阶段分析计划的充分性；(3)顺序规划机制，从简单可执行计划开始，基于反馈迭代优化直到验证通过。

Result: 实验表明，DS-STAR在三个具有挑战性的基准测试（DABStep、KramaBench和DA-Code）中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要处理多个异构格式数据文件的困难任务上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DS-STAR通过其迭代优化方法能够可靠地导航涉及多样化数据源的复杂分析，为自动化数据科学任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Data science, which transforms raw data into actionable insights, is critical
for data-driven decision-making. However, these tasks are often complex,
involving steps for exploring multiple data sources and synthesizing findings
to deliver insightful answers. While large language models (LLMs) show
significant promise in automating this process, they often struggle with
heterogeneous data formats and generate sub-optimal analysis plans, as
verifying plan sufficiency is inherently difficult without ground-truth labels
for such open-ended tasks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DS-STAR,
a novel data science agent. Specifically, DS-STAR makes three key
contributions: (1) a data file analysis module that automatically explores and
extracts context from diverse data formats, including unstructured types; (2) a
verification step where an LLM-based judge evaluates the sufficiency of the
analysis plan at each stage; and (3) a sequential planning mechanism that
starts with a simple, executable plan and iteratively refines it based on the
DS-STAR's feedback until its sufficiency is verified. This iterative refinement
allows DS-STAR to reliably navigate complex analyses involving diverse data
sources. Our experiments show that DS-STAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance across three challenging benchmarks: DABStep, KramaBench, and
DA-Code. Moreover, DS-STAR particularly outperforms baselines on hard tasks
that require processing multiple data files with heterogeneous formats.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于公理（如伦理约束）的决策建模框架，定义了决策公理的分类法，并揭示了决策-评估悖论，指出在训练模型或应用公理时需要格外谨慎。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究决策过程中使用公理（如伦理约束）时出现的根本性问题，特别是决策与评估之间的内在矛盾。

Method: 开发了一个决策建模框架，基于公理的结构特性定义分类法，分析决策公理在制定决策和评估决策时的应用差异。

Result: 发现了决策-评估悖论，证明该悖论在现实的公理结构中普遍存在，揭示了使用决策数据训练模型或应用公理时的潜在风险。

Conclusion: 在训练决策模型或应用决策公理时需要格外谨慎，因为决策-评估悖论表明决策制定和决策评估之间存在根本性的紧张关系。

Abstract: We introduce a framework for modeling decisions with axioms that are
statements about decisions, e.g., ethical constraints. Using our framework we
define a taxonomy of decision axioms based on their structural properties and
demonstrate a tension between the use of axioms to make decisions and the use
of axioms to evaluate decisions which we call the Decision-Evaluation Paradox.
We argue that the Decision-Evaluation Paradox arises with realistic axiom
structures, and the paradox illuminates why one must be exceptionally careful
when training models on decision data or applying axioms to make and evaluate
decisions.

Abstract: Travel planning (TP) agent has recently worked as an emerging building block
to interact with external tools and resources for travel itinerary generation,
ensuring enjoyable user experience. Despite its benefits, existing studies rely
on hand craft prompt and fixed agent workflow, hindering more flexible and
autonomous TP agent. This paper proposes DeepTravel, an end to end agentic
reinforcement learning framework for building autonomous travel planning agent,
capable of autonomously planning, executing tools, and reflecting on tool
responses to explore, verify, and refine intermediate actions in multi step
reasoning. To achieve this, we first construct a robust sandbox environment by
caching transportation, accommodation and POI data, facilitating TP agent
training without being constrained by real world APIs limitations (e.g.,
inconsistent outputs). Moreover, we develop a hierarchical reward modeling
system, where a trajectory level verifier first checks spatiotemporal
feasibility and filters unsatisfied travel itinerary, and then the turn level
verifier further validate itinerary detail consistency with tool responses,
enabling efficient and precise reward service. Finally, we propose the reply
augmented reinforcement learning method that enables TP agent to periodically
replay from a failures experience buffer, emerging notable agentic capacity. We
deploy trained TP agent on DiDi Enterprise Solutions App and conduct
comprehensive online and offline evaluations, demonstrating that DeepTravel
enables small size LLMs (e.g., Qwen3 32B) to significantly outperform existing
frontier LLMs such as OpenAI o1, o3 and DeepSeek R1 in travel planning tasks.

Abstract: The study of emergent behaviors in large language model (LLM)-driven
multi-agent systems is a critical research challenge, yet progress is limited
by a lack of principled methodologies for controlled experimentation. To
address this, we introduce Shachi, a formal methodology and modular framework
that decomposes an agent's policy into core cognitive components: Configuration
for intrinsic traits, Memory for contextual persistence, and Tools for expanded
capabilities, all orchestrated by an LLM reasoning engine. This principled
architecture moves beyond brittle, ad-hoc agent designs and enables the
systematic analysis of how specific architectural choices influence collective
behavior. We validate our methodology on a comprehensive 10-task benchmark and
demonstrate its power through novel scientific inquiries. Critically, we
establish the external validity of our approach by modeling a real-world U.S.
tariff shock, showing that agent behaviors align with observed market reactions
only when their cognitive architecture is appropriately configured with memory
and tools. Our work provides a rigorous, open-source foundation for building
and evaluating LLM agents, aimed at fostering more cumulative and
scientifically grounded research.

TL;DR: TRACE是一种新的图表示学习范式，用于计算图功能建模，通过层次化Transformer架构和函数偏移学习目标，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流消息传递神经网络(MPNNs)和传统Transformer在图计算任务中存在架构不匹配问题，无法捕捉计算的位置感知和层次化特性。

Method: 使用层次化Transformer模拟逐步计算流程，引入函数偏移学习目标，将复杂全局函数预测分解为预测真实函数与简单局部近似之间的差异。

Result: 在电子电路等复杂计算图上，TRACE在全面基准测试中显著优于所有先前架构。

Conclusion: 架构对齐的主干网络和解耦学习目标为图计算学习问题提供了更鲁棒的范式。

Abstract: Learning to compute, the ability to model the functional behavior of a
computational graph, is a fundamental challenge for graph representation
learning. Yet, the dominant paradigm is architecturally mismatched for this
task. This flawed assumption, central to mainstream message passing neural
networks (MPNNs) and their conventional Transformer-based counterparts,
prevents models from capturing the position-aware, hierarchical nature of
computation. To resolve this, we introduce \textbf{TRACE}, a new paradigm built
on an architecturally sound backbone and a principled learning objective.
First, TRACE employs a Hierarchical Transformer that mirrors the step-by-step
flow of computation, providing a faithful architectural backbone that replaces
the flawed permutation-invariant aggregation. Second, we introduce
\textbf{function shift learning}, a novel objective that decouples the learning
problem. Instead of predicting the complex global function directly, our model
is trained to predict only the \textit{function shift}, the discrepancy between
the true global function and a simple local approximation that assumes input
independence. We validate this paradigm on electronic circuits, one of the most
complex and economically critical classes of computational graphs. Across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks, TRACE substantially outperforms all prior
architectures. These results demonstrate that our architecturally-aligned
backbone and decoupled learning objective form a more robust paradigm for the
fundamental challenge of learning to compute on graphs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态作业车间调度面临新作业到达带来的频繁中断，现有离线学习策略不完美，而在线规划又因问题信息不完整容易受到干扰。

Method: DyRo-MCTS方法，在MCTS中集成动作鲁棒性估计，引导生产环境达到既产生良好调度结果又易于适应未来作业到达的状态。

Result: 实验表明DyRo-MCTS显著提升了离线学习策略的性能，且在线规划时间增加可忽略；在各种调度场景中始终优于原始MCTS。

Conclusion: DyRo-MCTS通过做出鲁棒调度决策，在干扰下实现了长期、可持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Dynamic job shop scheduling, a fundamental combinatorial optimisation problem
in various industrial sectors, poses substantial challenges for effective
scheduling due to frequent disruptions caused by the arrival of new jobs.
State-of-the-art methods employ machine learning to learn scheduling policies
offline, enabling rapid responses to dynamic events. However, these offline
policies are often imperfect, necessitating the use of planning techniques such
as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to improve performance at online decision
time. The unpredictability of new job arrivals complicates online planning, as
decisions based on incomplete problem information are vulnerable to
disturbances. To address this issue, we propose the Dynamic Robust MCTS
(DyRo-MCTS) approach, which integrates action robustness estimation into MCTS.
DyRo-MCTS guides the production environment toward states that not only yield
good scheduling outcomes but are also easily adaptable to future job arrivals.
Extensive experiments show that DyRo-MCTS significantly improves the
performance of offline-learned policies with negligible additional online
planning time. Moreover, DyRo-MCTS consistently outperforms vanilla MCTS across
various scheduling scenarios. Further analysis reveals that its ability to make
robust scheduling decisions leads to long-term, sustainable performance gains
under disturbances.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了统计参数映射(SPM)和可解释机器学习方法在足底压力数据异常检测中的表现，发现机器学习模型在准确性上优于SPM，且两种方法的解释性均被专家认可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足底压力映射在临床诊断和运动科学中很重要，但大型异构数据集常包含技术错误或程序不一致导致的异常值。SPM提供可解释分析但对对齐敏感，其稳健异常检测能力尚不明确。

Method: 比较了(i)非参数、配准依赖的SPM方法和(ii)使用SHAP解释的卷积神经网络(CNN)。通过嵌套交叉验证评估性能，通过语义差异调查评估解释质量。

Result: 机器学习模型达到高准确率并优于SPM，SPM误分类了临床有意义的变异并遗漏了真实异常值。专家认为SPM和SHAP解释都清晰、有用且可信，但SPM复杂度较低。

Conclusion: SPM和可解释机器学习在足底压力数据自动异常检测中具有互补潜力，可解释性在将复杂模型输出转化为可解释见解以有效支持决策方面至关重要。

Abstract: Plantar pressure mapping is essential in clinical diagnostics and sports
science, yet large heterogeneous datasets often contain outliers from technical
errors or procedural inconsistencies. Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
provides interpretable analyses but is sensitive to alignment and its capacity
for robust outlier detection remains unclear. This study compares an SPM
approach with an explainable machine learning (ML) approach to establish
transparent quality-control pipelines for plantar pressure datasets. Data from
multiple centers were annotated by expert consensus and enriched with synthetic
anomalies resulting in 798 valid samples and 2000 outliers. We evaluated (i) a
non-parametric, registration-dependent SPM approach and (ii) a convolutional
neural network (CNN), explained using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP).
Performance was assessed via nested cross-validation; explanation quality via a
semantic differential survey with domain experts. The ML model reached high
accuracy and outperformed SPM, which misclassified clinically meaningful
variations and missed true outliers. Experts perceived both SPM and SHAP
explanations as clear, useful, and trustworthy, though SPM was assessed less
complex. These findings highlight the complementary potential of SPM and
explainable ML as approaches for automated outlier detection in plantar
pressure data, and underscore the importance of explainability in translating
complex model outputs into interpretable insights that can effectively inform
decision-making.

Motivation: 现有LLM协作框架忽视了动态意图推理的潜力，导致计划不一致和冗余通信，降低协作效率。

Method: 提出CoBel-World框架，使用符号信念语言将开放世界任务知识解析为结构化信念，通过LLM推理进行零样本贝叶斯式信念更新。

Result: 在TDW-MAT和C-WAH基准测试中，通信成本减少22-60%，任务完成效率提高4-28%。

Conclusion: 显式的意图感知信念建模对于基于LLM的多智能体系统实现高效、类人协作至关重要。

Abstract: Effective real-world multi-agent collaboration requires not only accurate
planning but also the ability to reason about collaborators' intents -- a
crucial capability for avoiding miscoordination and redundant communication
under partial observable environments. Due to their strong planning and
reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising
autonomous agents for collaborative task solving. However, existing
collaboration frameworks for LLMs overlook their reasoning potential for
dynamic intent inference, and thus produce inconsistent plans and redundant
communication, reducing collaboration efficiency. To bridge this gap, we
propose CoBel-World, a novel framework that equips LLM agents with a
collaborative belief world -- an internal representation jointly modeling the
physical environment and collaborators' mental states. CoBel-World enables
agents to parse open-world task knowledge into structured beliefs via a
symbolic belief language, and perform zero-shot Bayesian-style belief updates
through LLM reasoning. This allows agents to proactively detect potential
miscoordination (e.g., conflicting plans) and communicate adaptively. Evaluated
on challenging embodied benchmarks (i.e., TDW-MAT and C-WAH), CoBel-World
significantly reduces communication costs by 22-60% and improves task
completion efficiency by 4-28% compared to the strongest baseline. Our results
show that explicit, intent-aware belief modeling is essential for efficient and
human-like collaboration in LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统爬虫方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理所需的多样化、深度嵌入的网页数据，这些代理通常局限于单步任务，缺乏管理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492个单步和2,386个多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802个单步和320个多步轨迹）、RISK-R1强化微调框架（考虑输出格式、单步级别、多步级别和任务级别四个方面的奖励机制）。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网页交互提供了可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推动了电子商务风险管理的技术进步。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

TL;DR: 论文证明反转诅咒不是语言模型的固有限制，而是知识编码方式的产物。通过在关系知识图谱上训练，模型会形成双线性关系结构，这能缓解反转诅咒并实现一致的模型编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型的反转诅咒问题——无法从学到的"A是B"推断出"B是A"，并探索模型编辑的一致性问题。

Method: 在合成的关系知识图谱数据集上从头训练语言模型，分析其隐藏表示中出现的双线性关系结构。

Result: 具有双线性结构的模型能够推断未见过的反向事实，并且在编辑时能正确传播到相关事实，而缺乏这种结构的模型则无法实现。

Conclusion: 关系知识训练诱导双线性内部表示的出现，这对模型编辑的成功至关重要，表明编辑效果不仅取决于算法，还取决于底层表示几何结构。

Abstract: The reversal curse -- a language model's (LM) inability to infer an unseen
fact ``B is A'' from a learned fact ``A is B'' -- is widely considered a
fundamental limitation. We show that this is not an inherent failure but an
artifact of how models encode knowledge. By training LMs from scratch on a
synthetic dataset of relational knowledge graphs, we demonstrate that bilinear
relational structure emerges in their hidden representations. This structure
substantially alleviates the reversal curse, enabling LMs to infer unseen
reverse facts. Crucially, we also find that this bilinear structure plays a key
role in consistent model editing. When a fact is updated in a LM with this
structure, the edit correctly propagates to its reverse and other logically
dependent facts. In contrast, models lacking this representation not only
suffer from the reversal curse but also fail to generalize edits, further
introducing logical inconsistencies. Our results establish that training on a
relational knowledge dataset induces the emergence of bilinear internal
representations, which in turn enable LMs to behave in a logically consistent
manner after editing. This implies that the success of model editing depends
critically not just on editing algorithms but on the underlying
representational geometry of the knowledge being modified.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前智能体基准测试往往将智能体推理与复杂数学推理、专家级知识等高级能力混在一起，难以分离评估纯粹的智能体推理能力。需要专门评估LLM结合工具使用和推理的能力。

Method: 构建GSM-Agent基准测试，要求LLM智能体在仅获得问题提示的情况下，通过工具主动收集必要的前提信息来解决小学数学问题。提出智能体推理图概念，将环境文档嵌入聚类为节点，并将每个工具调用映射到最近节点来构建推理路径。

Result: 即使是GPT-5这样的前沿模型在GSM-Agent基准测试中也仅达到67%的准确率。分析发现许多模型在智能体推理中缺乏重新访问先前访问节点的能力，这是静态推理中的关键模式。

Conclusion: 提出的基准测试和智能体推理框架有助于未来理解和推进智能体推理边界的研究。通过工具增强的测试时缩放方法可以改善LLM的智能体推理性能。

Abstract: As LLMs are increasingly deployed as agents, agentic reasoning - the ability
to combine tool use, especially search, and reasoning - becomes a critical
skill. However, it is hard to disentangle agentic reasoning when evaluated in
complex environments and tasks. Current agent benchmarks often mix agentic
reasoning with challenging math reasoning, expert-level knowledge, and other
advanced capabilities. To fill this gap, we build a novel benchmark, GSM-Agent,
where an LLM agent is required to solve grade-school-level reasoning problems,
but is only presented with the question in the prompt without the premises that
contain the necessary information to solve the task, and needs to proactively
collect that information using tools. Although the original tasks are
grade-school math problems, we observe that even frontier models like GPT-5
only achieve 67% accuracy. To understand and analyze the agentic reasoning
patterns, we propose the concept of agentic reasoning graph: cluster the
environment's document embeddings into nodes, and map each tool call to its
nearest node to build a reasoning path. Surprisingly, we identify that the
ability to revisit a previously visited node, widely taken as a crucial pattern
in static reasoning, is often missing for agentic reasoning for many models.
Based on the insight, we propose a tool-augmented test-time scaling method to
improve LLM's agentic reasoning performance by adding tools to encourage models
to revisit. We expect our benchmark and the agentic reasoning framework to aid
future studies of understanding and pushing the boundaries of agentic
reasoning.

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大推理模型虽然在推理阶段通过"思考更久"的方式提升了复杂任务解决能力，但模型单次尝试的表现与其潜在能力之间仍存在显著差距。这种差距通常需要通过多个解路径才能揭示，表明模型的实际性能远未达到其内在潜力。

Method: 提出A2R非对称两阶段推理框架：第一阶段由"探索者"模型通过重复采样并行生成潜在解决方案；第二阶段由"综合者"模型整合这些参考进行更精细的推理。该框架支持与现有顺序方法正交的计算扩展。

Result: 使用A2R框架，Qwen3-8B-distill模型相比其自一致性基线实现了75%的性能提升。A2R-Efficient变体（Qwen3-4B探索者+Qwen3-8B综合者）在成本降低近30%的情况下，超越了单一Qwen3-32B模型的平均性能。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是一个性能提升框架，更是实际应用中高效实用的解决方案，通过非对称扩展范式实现了成本效益的优化。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义的多目标搜索问题表述，通过隐藏目标的聚合函数来优化解决方案目标，支持标准MOS算法的应用，只需适当扩展核心操作即可。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界机器人系统需要同时平衡多个相互冲突的目标，而现有问题表述无法直接使用最先进的多目标搜索算法。

Method: 使用隐藏目标的聚合函数来优化解决方案目标，扩展标准MOS算法的核心操作以反映特定的聚合函数。

Result: 在多个机器人规划问题中，扩展后的算法比未使用目标聚合的原始算法性能高出数个数量级。

Conclusion: 提出的广义问题表述支持标准MOS算法的应用，通过适当扩展核心操作，能够有效解决复杂多目标机器人规划问题。

Abstract: Multi-objective search (MOS) has become essential in robotics, as real-world
robotic systems need to simultaneously balance multiple, often conflicting
objectives. Recent works explore complex interactions between objectives,
leading to problem formulations that do not allow the usage of out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms. In this paper, we suggest a generalized
problem formulation that optimizes solution objectives via aggregation
functions of hidden (search) objectives. We show that our formulation supports
the application of standard MOS algorithms, necessitating only to properly
extend several core operations to reflect the specific aggregation functions
employed. We demonstrate our approach in several diverse robotics planning
problems, spanning motion-planning for navigation, manipulation and planning fr
medical systems under obstacle uncertainty as well as inspection planning, and
route planning with different road types. We solve the problems using
state-of-the-art MOS algorithms after properly extending their core operations,
and provide empirical evidence that they outperform by orders of magnitude the
vanilla versions of the algorithms applied to the same problems but without
objective aggregation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI快速发展带来的环境影响日益显著，现有能耗估算工具虽然易于使用，但其假设和忽略因素引发了估算准确性的质疑，需要系统验证这些工具的可靠性。

Method: 通过提出的验证框架，将静态和动态能耗估算方法与数百个AI实验的真实测量数据进行系统比较，分析估算误差和准确性。

Result: 研究发现现有估算方法虽然总体上能反映AI能耗模式，但存在高达40%的持续误差，揭示了估算工具在实际应用中的局限性。

Conclusion: 本研究为可持续AI发展建立了透明度，验证了广泛使用的能耗估算工具，并提出了改进指南和可扩展的验证代码，为资源感知的ML和AI可持续性研究做出重要贡献。

Abstract: Although machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) present
fascinating opportunities for innovation, their rapid development is also
significantly impacting our environment. In response to growing
resource-awareness in the field, quantification tools such as the ML Emissions
Calculator and CodeCarbon were developed to estimate the energy consumption and
carbon emissions of running AI models. They are easy to incorporate into AI
projects, however also make pragmatic assumptions and neglect important
factors, raising the question of estimation accuracy. This study systematically
evaluates the reliability of static and dynamic energy estimation approaches
through comparisons with ground-truth measurements across hundreds of AI
experiments. Based on the proposed validation framework, investigative insights
into AI energy demand and estimation inaccuracies are provided. While generally
following the patterns of AI energy consumption, the established estimation
approaches are shown to consistently make errors of up to 40%. By providing
empirical evidence on energy estimation quality and errors, this study
establishes transparency and validates widely used tools for sustainable AI
development. It moreover formulates guidelines for improving the
state-of-the-art and offers code for extending the validation to other domains
and tools, thus making important contributions to resource-aware ML and AI
sustainability research.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Log2Plan结合结构化两级规划框架和用户行为日志的任务挖掘方法，解决了现有GUI自动化工具在泛化性、延迟和长时程一致性方面的局限性，实现了更鲁棒和自适应的GUI自动化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM或VLM的规划器-执行器代理存在脆弱的泛化能力、高延迟和有限的长时程一致性，依赖单次推理或静态计划使其在UI变化或复杂任务下表现脆弱。

Method: Log2Plan采用结构化两级规划框架：高层规划将用户命令映射到结构化任务字典，实现一致且可泛化的自动化；通过用户行为日志的任务挖掘识别用户特定模式；低层规划将高层计划基于实时GUI上下文转化为具体动作序列。

Result: 在200个真实世界任务上的评估显示，Log2Plan在任务成功率和执行时间方面均有显著提升，在长时程任务序列中保持超过60.0%的成功率。

Conclusion: Log2Plan通过结合结构化规划和任务挖掘方法，为GUI自动化提供了更鲁棒和自适应的解决方案，特别在复杂多步骤工作流中表现出色。

Abstract: GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high
latency, and limited long-horizon coherence. Their reliance on single-shot
reasoning or static plans makes them fragile under UI changes or complex tasks.
Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world
tasks, demonstrating significant improvements in task success rate and
execution time. Notably, it maintains over 60.0% success rate even on
long-horizon task sequences, highlighting its robustness in complex, multi-step
workflows.

TL;DR: 论文主张在机器学习评估中应考虑标注不确定性，使用概率度量来直接处理分布，而非简单聚合标注结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集的标注通常存在不确定性，因为标注者之间存在分歧且置信度不一致。传统的聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性。

Method: 提出使用概率度量来明确处理标注不确定性，这些度量可以直接在分布上操作，适用于各种标注生成过程（如简单计数、主观置信度评级或概率响应模型）。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响了模型排名。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布数据集的原始标注并采用不确定性感知评估，以使性能估计更好地反映临床数据。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation framework for assessing Large Language

addressing the 2D bin-packing problem. We introduce a systematic methodology
that combines LLMs with evolutionary algorithms to generate and refine
heuristic solutions iteratively. Through comprehensive experiments comparing
LLM generated heuristics against traditional approaches (Finite First-Fit and
Hybrid First-Fit), we demonstrate that LLMs can produce more efficient
solutions while requiring fewer computational resources. Our evaluation reveals
that GPT-4o achieves optimal solutions within two iterations, reducing average
bin usage from 16 to 15 bins while improving space utilization from 0.76-0.78
to 0.83. This work contributes to understanding LLM evaluation in specialized
domains and establishes benchmarks for assessing LLM performance in
combinatorial optimization tasks.

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域专业知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗保健领域更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案铺平了道路。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PD-SSM方法，通过结构化稀疏参数化状态转移矩阵，在保持计算效率的同时实现最优有限状态自动机表达能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代状态空间模型使用结构化转移矩阵限制了表达能力，而无结构矩阵计算成本过高，需要平衡表达能力和计算效率

Method: 将转移矩阵参数化为列独热矩阵(P)和复值对角矩阵(D)的乘积，使并行扫描计算成本与状态大小呈线性关系

Result: 理论上能模拟任意N状态FSA，实验在FSA状态跟踪任务中优于多种现代SSM变体，时间序列分类性能与神经控制微分方程相当

Conclusion: PD-SSM在保持计算效率的同时实现了最优表达能力，可有效集成到混合Transformer-SSM架构中处理复杂状态跟踪任务

Abstract: Modern state-space models (SSMs) often utilize transition matrices which
enable efficient computation but pose restrictions on the model's expressivity,
as measured in terms of the ability to emulate finite-state automata (FSA).
While unstructured transition matrices are optimal in terms of expressivity,
they come at a prohibitively high compute and memory cost even for moderate
state sizes. We propose a structured sparse parametrization of transition
matrices in SSMs that enables FSA state tracking with optimal state size and
depth, while keeping the computational cost of the recurrence comparable to
that of diagonal SSMs. Our method, PD-SSM, parametrizes the transition matrix
as the product of a column one-hot matrix ($P$) and a complex-valued diagonal
matrix ($D$). Consequently, the computational cost of parallel scans scales
linearly with the state size. Theoretically, the model is BIBO-stable and can
emulate any $N$-state FSA with one layer of dimension $N$ and a linear readout
of size $N \times N$, significantly improving on all current structured SSM
guarantees. Experimentally, the model significantly outperforms a wide
collection of modern SSM variants on various FSA state tracking tasks. On
multiclass time-series classification, the performance is comparable to that of
neural controlled differential equations, a paradigm explicitly built for
time-series analysis. Finally, we integrate PD-SSM into a hybrid
Transformer-SSM architecture and demonstrate that the model can effectively
track the states of a complex FSA in which transitions are encoded as a set of
variable-length English sentences. The code is available at

Result: 提出了一个更简单的反事实生成方法，该方法与现有方法在特定类型的反事实生成上各有优势。

Conclusion: 为LLM反事实推理提供了理论基础，基于语义意图理解，为特定应用场景的定制化反事实生成方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent work by Chatzi et al. and Ravfogel et al. has developed, for the first
time, a method for generating counterfactuals of probabilistic Large Language
Models. Such counterfactuals tell us what would - or might - have been the
output of an LLM if some factual prompt ${\bf x}$ had been ${\bf x}^*$ instead.
The ability to generate such counterfactuals is an important necessary step
towards explaining, evaluating, and comparing, the behavior of LLMs. I argue,
however, that the existing method rests on an ambiguous interpretation of LLMs:
it does not interpret LLMs literally, for the method involves the assumption
that one can change the implementation of an LLM's sampling process without
changing the LLM itself, nor does it interpret LLMs as intended, for the method
involves explicitly representing a nondeterministic LLM as a deterministic
causal model. I here present a much simpler method for generating
counterfactuals that is based on an LLM's intended interpretation by
representing it as a nondeterministic causal model instead. The advantage of my
simpler method is that it is directly applicable to any black-box LLM without
modification, as it is agnostic to any implementation details. The advantage of
the existing method, on the other hand, is that it directly implements the
generation of a specific type of counterfactuals that is useful for certain
purposes, but not for others. I clarify how both methods relate by offering a
theoretical foundation for reasoning about counterfactuals in LLMs based on
their intended semantics, thereby laying the groundwork for novel
application-specific methods for generating counterfactuals.

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

Conclusion: EMMA框架通过生成数据和有效训练策略，显著提升了VLA模型的泛化能力，为机器人操作提供了高效的数据增强方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models increasingly rely on diverse training
data to achieve robust generalization. However, collecting large-scale
real-world robot manipulation data across varied object appearances and
environmental conditions remains prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. To
overcome this bottleneck, we propose Embodied Manipulation Media Adaptation
(EMMA), a VLA policy enhancement framework that integrates a generative data
engine with an effective training pipeline. We introduce DreamTransfer, a
diffusion Transformer-based framework for generating multi-view consistent,
geometrically grounded embodied manipulation videos. DreamTransfer enables
text-controlled visual editing of robot videos, transforming foreground,
background, and lighting conditions without compromising 3D structure or
geometrical plausibility. Furthermore, we explore hybrid training with real and
generated data, and introduce AdaMix, a hard-sample-aware training strategy
that dynamically reweights training batches to focus optimization on
perceptually or kinematically challenging samples. Extensive experiments show
that videos generated by DreamTransfer significantly outperform prior video
generation methods in multi-view consistency, geometric fidelity, and
text-conditioning accuracy. Crucially, VLAs trained with generated data enable
robots to generalize to unseen object categories and novel visual domains using
only demonstrations from a single appearance. In real-world robotic
manipulation tasks with zero-shot visual domains, our approach achieves over a
200% relative performance gain compared to training on real data alone, and
further improves by 13% with AdaMix, demonstrating its effectiveness in
boosting policy generalization.

Conclusion: ASAL++为基础模型驱动的人工生命发现指出了具有开放式特征的新方向。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.

Method: GeoSketch集成三个模块：感知模块将图表抽象为结构化逻辑形式，符号推理模块应用几何定理决定下一个演绎步骤，草图行动模块执行绘制辅助线或应用变换等操作。采用两阶段训练：监督微调和强化学习。

Result: 在GeoSketch基准测试中，GeoSketch显著提高了逐步推理准确性和问题解决成功率，优于静态感知方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一分层决策、可执行视觉行动和符号验证，GeoSketch将多模态推理从静态解释推进到动态可验证交互，为复杂视觉空间问题解决建立了新基础。

Abstract: Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text
and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing
approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for
dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving
auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a
neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive
perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module
that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning
module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and
(3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary
lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed
loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement
learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic
exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a
high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or
affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that
GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and
problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying
hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic
verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static
interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new
foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.

TL;DR: InfiAgent是一个基于有向无环图的金字塔式多智能体框架，通过自动分解复杂任务、双重审核机制、智能路由和自进化能力，解决了LLM智能体开发中的可扩展性和成本效益问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM智能体开发需要精心设计的工作流程、提示工程和迭代调优，这些手工制作的方法限制了智能体在不同行业中的可扩展性和成本效益。

Method: 提出金字塔式DAG多智能体框架，包含：智能体即工具机制、双重审核机制、智能体路由功能、智能体自进化机制，以及支持并行执行的原子任务设计。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，InfiAgent比类似的自生成智能体框架ADAS性能高出9.9%；案例研究显示InfiHelper生成的科研论文获得了IEEE顶级会议人类评审的认可。

Conclusion: InfiAgent框架能够演化成通用的金字塔式多智能体系统，有效解决广泛领域的问题，显著提升了LLM智能体的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in organizing and executing complex tasks, and many such agents are now widely
used in various application scenarios. However, developing these agents
requires carefully designed workflows, carefully crafted prompts, and iterative
tuning, which requires LLM techniques and domain-specific expertise. These
hand-crafted limitations hinder the scalability and cost-effectiveness of LLM
agents across a wide range of industries. To address these challenges, we
propose \textbf{InfiAgent}, a Pyramid-like DAG-based Multi-Agent Framework that
can be applied to \textbf{infi}nite scenarios, which introduces several key
innovations: a generalized "agent-as-a-tool" mechanism that automatically
decomposes complex agents into hierarchical multi-agent systems; a dual-audit
mechanism that ensures the quality and stability of task completion; an agent
routing function that enables efficient task-agent matching; and an agent
self-evolution mechanism that autonomously restructures the agent DAG based on
new tasks, poor performance, or optimization opportunities. Furthermore,
InfiAgent's atomic task design supports agent parallelism, significantly
improving execution efficiency. This framework evolves into a versatile
pyramid-like multi-agent system capable of solving a wide range of problems.
Evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that InfiAgent achieves 9.9\%
higher performance compared to ADAS (similar auto-generated agent framework),
while a case study of the AI research assistant InfiHelper shows that it
generates scientific papers that have received recognition from human reviewers
at top-tier IEEE conferences.

TL;DR: 提出基于信息论中赋能概念（行动与未来状态的互信息）的LM智能体评估方法EELMA，该方法在语言游戏和网络浏览场景中验证有效，与任务性能强相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于基准测试的评估方法成本高且需要人工设计任务，需要一种可扩展的开放评估框架来评估LM智能体的能力。

Method: 提出EELMA算法，通过多轮文本交互来近似估计有效赋能，在语言游戏和实际网络浏览场景中进行验证。

Result: 赋能与平均任务性能强相关，能表征环境复杂性和智能体因素（如思维链、模型规模、记忆长度）的影响，高赋能状态通常是关键能力时刻。

Conclusion: 赋能是评估复杂开放环境中LM智能体的有吸引力的通用指标。

Abstract: As language model (LM) agents become more capable and gain broader access to
real-world tools, there is a growing need for scalable evaluation frameworks of
agentic capability. However, conventional benchmark-centric evaluations are
costly to design and require human designers to come up with valid tasks that
translate into insights about general model capabilities. In this work, we
propose information-theoretic evaluation based on empowerment, the mutual
information between an agent's actions and future states, as an open-ended
method for evaluating LM agents. We introduce EELMA (Estimating Empowerment of
Language Model Agents), an algorithm for approximating effective empowerment
from multi-turn text interactions. We validate EELMA on both language games and
scaled-up realistic web-browsing scenarios. We find that empowerment strongly
correlates with average task performance, characterize the impact of
environmental complexity and agentic factors such as chain-of-thought, model
scale, and memory length on estimated empowerment, and that high empowerment
states and actions are often pivotal moments for general capabilities.
Together, these results demonstrate empowerment as an appealing general-purpose
metric for evaluating and monitoring LM agents in complex, open-ended settings.

Abstract: This paper introduces TrueGradeAI, an AI-driven digital examination framework
designed to overcome the shortcomings of traditional paper-based assessments,
including excessive paper usage, logistical complexity, grading delays, and
evaluator bias. The system preserves natural handwriting by capturing stylus
input on secure tablets and applying transformer-based optical character
recognition for transcription. Evaluation is conducted through a
retrieval-augmented pipeline that integrates faculty solutions, cache layers,
and external references, enabling a large language model to assign scores with
explicit, evidence-linked reasoning. Unlike prior tablet-based exam systems
that primarily digitize responses, TrueGradeAI advances the field by
incorporating explainable automation, bias mitigation, and auditable grading
trails. By uniting handwriting preservation with scalable and transparent
evaluation, the framework reduces environmental costs, accelerates feedback
cycles, and progressively builds a reusable knowledge base, while actively
working to mitigate grading bias and ensure fairness in assessment.

TL;DR: 提出了Reasoning Manifold概念和REMA框架，通过几何分析解释LLM推理失败的原因，量化错误表示与正确推理流形之间的空间偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解大型语言模型如何进行复杂推理及其失败机制是解释性研究的挑战，需要提供可测量的几何分析视角。

Method: 定义推理流形概念，构建REMA框架，通过计算错误表示与正确推理流形之间的k近邻距离来量化几何偏差，并追踪模型各层的偏差变化来定位分歧点。

Result: 实验验证了推理流形的低维特性，错误与正确推理表示之间的高度可分性，以及REMA框架在分析推理失败起源方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究将抽象推理失败与表示中的可测量几何偏差联系起来，为深入理解黑盒模型的内部计算过程提供了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding how Large Language Models (LLMs) perform complex reasoning and
their failure mechanisms is a challenge in interpretability research. To
provide a measurable geometric analysis perspective, we define the concept of
the Reasoning Manifold, a latent low-dimensional geometric structure formed by
the internal representations corresponding to all correctly reasoned
generations. This structure can be conceptualized as the embodiment of the
effective thinking paths that the model has learned to successfully solve a
given task. Based on this concept, we build REMA, a framework that explains the
origins of failures by quantitatively comparing the spatial relationships of
internal model representations corresponding to both erroneous and correct
reasoning samples. Specifically, REMA first quantifies the geometric deviation
of each erroneous representation by calculating its k-nearest neighbors
distance to the approximated manifold formed by correct representations,
thereby providing a unified failure signal. It then localizes the divergence
points where these deviations first become significant by tracking this
deviation metric across the model's layers and comparing it against a baseline
of internal fluctuations from correct representations, thus identifying where
the reasoning chain begins to go off-track. Our extensive experiments on
diverse language and multimodal models and tasks demonstrate the
low-dimensional nature of the reasoning manifold and the high separability
between erroneous and correct reasoning representations. The results also
validate the effectiveness of the REMA framework in analyzing the origins of
reasoning failures. This research connects abstract reasoning failures to
measurable geometric deviations in representations, providing new avenues for
in-depth understanding and diagnosis of the internal computational processes of
black-box models.

TL;DR: 该研究通过大规模LLM智能体社会模拟，首次揭示了不同大语言模型在利己与利他倾向上的内在异质性，识别出"适应性利己主义者"和"利他优化者"两种社会行动逻辑原型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注小规模任务导向游戏中的合作行为，忽视了大规模智能体社会中利他主义的涌现机制，需要理解LLM智能体所体现的社会逻辑。

Method: 引入Schelling变体城市迁移模型，创建社会困境，让200多个LLM智能体在利己（个人效用）和利他（系统效用）目标间进行权衡；采用扎根理论启发的方法系统编码智能体推理过程。

Result: 发现LLM存在两种社会倾向原型：适应性利己主义者（默认优先自利但在社会规范影响下利他行为显著增加）和利他优化者（固有地利他逻辑，持续优先集体利益）。

Conclusion: 社会模拟中的模型选择不仅是推理能力的选择，更是内在社会行动逻辑的选择；适应性利己主义者更适合模拟复杂人类社会，利他优化者更适合模拟理想化亲社会行为者。

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for social simulation is a frontier
in computational social science. Understanding the social logics these agents
embody is critical to this attempt. However, existing research has primarily
focused on cooperation in small-scale, task-oriented games, overlooking how
altruism, which means sacrificing self-interest for collective benefit, emerges
in large-scale agent societies. To address this gap, we introduce a
Schelling-variant urban migration model that creates a social dilemma,
compelling over 200 LLM agents to navigate an explicit conflict between
egoistic (personal utility) and altruistic (system utility) goals. Our central
finding is a fundamental difference in the social tendencies of LLMs. We
identify two distinct archetypes: "Adaptive Egoists", which default to
prioritizing self-interest but whose altruistic behaviors significantly
increase under the influence of a social norm-setting message board; and
"Altruistic Optimizers", which exhibit an inherent altruistic logic,
consistently prioritizing collective benefit even at a direct cost to
themselves. Furthermore, to qualitatively analyze the cognitive underpinnings
of these decisions, we introduce a method inspired by Grounded Theory to
systematically code agent reasoning. In summary, this research provides the
first evidence of intrinsic heterogeneity in the egoistic and altruistic
tendencies of different LLMs. We propose that for social simulation, model
selection is not merely a matter of choosing reasoning capability, but of
choosing an intrinsic social action logic. While "Adaptive Egoists" may offer a
more suitable choice for simulating complex human societies, "Altruistic
Optimizers" are better suited for modeling idealized pro-social actors or
scenarios where collective welfare is the primary consideration.

TL;DR: StepORLM是一个自演化的LLM框架，通过生成式过程监督解决运筹学问题，在6个基准测试中达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在两个关键限制：结果奖励存在信用分配问题，正确最终答案可能强化错误推理；传统判别式过程监督短视，无法整体评估运筹学建模的相互依赖步骤

Method: 提出StepORLM框架，包含策略模型和生成式过程奖励模型(GenPRM)的协同进化循环，采用双反馈机制：外部求解器的确定性结果验证和GenPRM的细致整体过程评估，通过加权直接偏好优化(W-DPO)对齐策略并同时优化GenPRM

Result: 8B参数的StepORLM在6个基准测试中达到新SOTA，显著优于更大通用模型、代理方法和专业基线；协同进化的GenPRM可作为强大通用过程验证器，大幅提升自身和其他现有LLM的推理扩展性能

Conclusion: StepORLM通过生成式过程监督和协同进化循环有效解决了运筹学问题中的信用分配和过程评估问题，展示了在运筹学领域的强大应用潜力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving
Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a
powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally
face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit
assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning.
Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to
evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we
introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process
supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a
policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve
on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive,
outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic
process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the
policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously
refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new
state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly
larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover,
the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable
process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of
both our own model and other existing LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: UniMIC是一个统一的基于token的多模态交互编码框架，通过使用紧凑的token化表示作为通信媒介，在保持与大型多模态模型兼容性的同时实现高效低比特率传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有编解码器仍针对单模态单向通信优化，在传统压缩-传输-重建管道中会导致重复的质量下降。需要解决边缘设备与云端AI代理之间的多模态交互通信问题。

Method: 采用基于token的紧凑表示作为通信媒介，使用轻量级Transformer熵模型（通用、掩码和文本条件三种设计）来最小化token间冗余。

Result: 在文本到图像生成、文本引导修复、扩展和视觉问答等任务上，UniMIC实现了显著的比特率节省，即使在超低比特率（<0.05bpp）下仍保持鲁棒性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: UniMIC为下一代多模态交互通信提供了一个实用且前瞻的范式。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI
agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal
interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way
communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional
compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose
UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that
bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or
plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the
communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while
maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression,
lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific
designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token
redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided
inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC
achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low
bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These
results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for
next-generation multimodal interactive communication.

TL;DR: 提出了动态专家搜索（DES），一种在测试时通过控制MoE模型中激活专家数量来增强推理能力的方法，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量可以产生互补的解决方案集，这揭示了一个未被充分探索的多样性来源。

Method: DES包含两个关键组件：动态MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量以生成多样化推理轨迹）和专家配置继承（在推理路径内保持一致的专家数量，在不同运行间变化专家数量）。

Result: 在MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试（数学、代码和知识）上的广泛实验表明，DES可靠地优于TTS基线方法，无需额外成本即可提高准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: DES作为一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLM结构灵活性如何推动推理能力的发展。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

Motivation: 当前RL方法显著提升了LLM的规划能力，但其有效性的理论基础尚不明确。本文旨在通过可处理的图抽象来理解RL在LLM规划中的优势和局限。

Method: 采用基于图的抽象框架，重点分析策略梯度和Q学习方法。在理论分析基础上，进一步在真实世界规划基准Blocksworld上进行验证。

Result: SFT会引入基于共现的伪相关解；RL通过探索实现更好的泛化；策略梯度存在多样性崩溃问题；Q学习能保持多样性并避免奖励破解。

Conclusion: RL通过探索机制在LLM规划中具有优势，但需要关注策略梯度的多样性问题，Q学习在保持多样性和避免奖励破解方面表现更好，合理的奖励设计至关重要。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical
basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate
RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction,
focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical
analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce
co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning
primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling
better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity
collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even
after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key
advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We
further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward
hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world
planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in
practice.

Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型缺乏对头发动态的细粒度控制，而头发模拟和渲染面临复杂的动力学、材料属性和光发交互挑战。

Result: 在10K视频数据集上训练，ControlHair优于基于文本和姿态的基线方法，能精确控制头发动态。

Conclusion: ControlHair是首个物理信息视频扩散框架，支持动态发型试戴、子弹时间效果和电影图形等应用。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS模型在功耗受限的扩展现实(XR)设备上效率低下，需要瓦级功耗运行，因此需要优化其渲染和显示功耗。

Method: 提出了一个通用问题公式化方法，包括识别显示和渲染功耗景观中的等质量曲线，以及找到给定曲线上功耗最小的点（具有闭式解），并支持注视点渲染。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，PowerGS相比最先进的3DGS模型可实现高达86%的总功耗减少，同时主观和客观质量损失最小。

Conclusion: PowerGS是首个在质量约束下联合最小化3DGS渲染和显示功耗的框架，为XR设备提供了高效的3DGS解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) combines classic image-based rendering,
pointbased graphics, and modern differentiable techniques, and offers an
interesting alternative to traditional physically-based rendering. 3DGS-family
models are far from efficient for power-constrained Extended Reality (XR)
devices, which need to operate at a Watt-level. This paper introduces PowerGS,
the first framework to jointly minimize the rendering and display power in 3DGS
under a quality constraint. We present a general problem formulation and show
that solving the problem amounts to 1) identifying the iso-quality curve(s) in
the landscape subtended by the display and rendering power and 2) identifying
the power-minimal point on a given curve, which has a closed-form solution
given a proper parameterization of the curves. PowerGS also readily supports
foveated rendering for further power savings. Extensive experiments and user
studies show that PowerGS achieves up to 86% total power reduction compared to
state-of-the-art 3DGS models, with minimal loss in both subjective and
objective quality. Code is available at

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于现有方法，并能扩展到帧插值和交互式物体操作等应用。

Conclusion: DeformSplat能够仅从单张图像重建一致的变形，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Abstract: Learning a control policy for a multi-phase, long-horizon task, such as
basketball maneuvers, remains challenging for reinforcement learning approaches
due to the need for seamless policy composition and transitions between skills.
A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined
goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to
the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts
and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share
significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal
states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy
integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor
skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states.
Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless
and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set
of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained
by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact
with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user
commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.
